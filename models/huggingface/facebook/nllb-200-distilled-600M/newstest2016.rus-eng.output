The social card of a resident of the Ivanov region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The amendments provide for the preservation of the passenger transportation allowance.
From September 24th, the procedure for organizing the preferential travel of citizens using the social card of a resident of the Ivanov region is changing.
According to the press service of the Russian government in Ivanov region, the changes prescribe the preservation of the travel allowance in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual payments on the social card into line with the requirements of Federal law No. 161 "On the national payment system".
The social card of a resident of the Ivanov region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The conditions for its use are changing accordingly.
Thus, the limit of replenishment is now set not in travel, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter not more than 400 rubles, in summer period - not more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now, social card holders will need to track the balance of money, not the number of trips left, on the receipts they receive in transit.
The cost of the preferential travel for citizens will be 1/2 of the carrier's current fare.
The rest of the cost of the trip is paid by the regional budget.
The schedule for replenishing the social card with money remains the same - from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new social map will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to keep detailed accounts of spending on a social card with an accuracy of up to a penny.
In addition, the possibility of returning the money that has been deposited but not spent is also available.
The scheme of inter-payment with carriers is becoming transparent, as half of the cost of the journey is now paid by the citizen and the same amount is reimbursed to the carrier by the budget.
No fees will be charged when you deposit money on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, deputy head of the department of road and transport of Ivanov region, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million trips were made in the region using a social card, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
The regional budget provides for more than 470 million rubles for the provision of a preferential travel of citizens using the social card.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During the 911 call, a teacher confessed to murdering his girlfriend.
During the 911 call, a near-trembling university professor, Shannon Lamb, told police he shot his girlfriend and that they needed staff to come to their home.
Lamb pointed out that there was a "dog" in the house who was alive but probably upset, and said that contacts from the family of the deceased could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note carelessly handwritten on a white sheet of lined paper: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could give it all back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me", according to a body spokesman signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who had taken two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by then traveled 300 miles to the university campus, where police believed he shot and killed the highly respected history professor Ethan Schmidt on the doorstep of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Baford said the university staff learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made that real 911 call shortly after.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb committed suicide as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the school shooting forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, the authorities were still trying to piece together the motives that led to the Lamb.
The information shared by investigators on both sides of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to paint a portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his class.
Police in Gotha, where Prentice died, said he was not charged with assault or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he expressed gratitude to the "beautiful people" he had come across in his teaching life.
Both taught in the faculty of social sciences and history, which has 17 faculty members, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well of Lamb, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him".
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 school year about how he coped with stress.
Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he was having some health problems.
He taught only two online courses this year.
Recent changes to university recruitment rules meant that a doctorate that Lamb had worked so hard to get would not guarantee him automatically a teaching position.
University president William Laforge said he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Obviously Mr. Lamb had something in mind".
These are questions Lamb can't answer anymore.
Police raided Lamb's trail after he ran off campus as he headed back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber revolver in the backyard of his home, one mile south of his parents' home in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County coroner Metel Johnson said.
His engine-powered car was still standing on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb had come to the house, although Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up on those edges.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring of that year.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lambo was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who spent years trying to teach her to play the guitar.
In those years, he enjoyed success with women.
All the girls were frowning when he was around", says Hayston, now in her 40's and living in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentice had been dating for a while.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife", but there's no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in Gothenburg in a brick house with the back of it facing the canal.
Police say the dog's fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19.
"She's totally depressed", O'Steen said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he never dated Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentice when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together at concerts from time to time.
O'Steen said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, bartender and co-entertainment coordinator at the dimly lit bar The Julep Room in the suburbs of Gothenburg, said he last saw Lamb and Prentice on the evening of September 5th, when Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica for a small audience.
Nothing suspicious was seen.
"Just a happy couple", he said.
We were having fun and making jokes about each other.
I mean, they were both very clever.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, conducted seminars for first-year students and specialized in Native American and colonial American history", said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the same school.
He was married and had three young children.
He attended Kansas State University in Emory and was president of the student fraternity and student self-government.
On the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including university faculty, staff, students, and community members, attended a memorial candlestick lighting ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt were also present at the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back", Laforge said.
The crisis is over.
Today is recovery day.
Amy and Rochelio Solis reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was prepared by Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a police statement that Lamb's call had come to 911 after Schmidt's murder, and also in connection with the fact that although Lamb referred to Prentice as his wife when he called 911, information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer staff for the holiday season
Toys R Us announces it will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as last year, while the children's toy and merchandise retailer says it will give staff and temporary staff the opportunity to work longer hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases across the country, less than the 45,000 hired during the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will start interviewing applicants this month and will increase staff from October to December.
Although it's only a few months before the holidays, the shopping season is coming up, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to have enough staff in stores and to sell, ship and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about seeing Princess Diana.
The premiere of Back to the Future was a big deal for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the royal family to arrive, and I noticed that the seat next to me was free, and here I was - next to me will be Princess Diana", he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary film "Back in Time".
The movie starts, and it's when I think I'm literally at a distance with my hand out and my fake cousin from seeing the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time - a documentary about Back in the Future - includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The movie "Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"To me", says Spielberg, "it is without a doubt the greatest time travel movie ever made".
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and in some theaters in October.
UN chief says no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in response to Russia's military support for Syria, says that for the nearly five-year conflict, "there is no military solution", and the increase in weapons will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the split UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Pan Gi Moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - during the General Assembly's ministerial session this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that differences in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, "made the situation insoluble".
Ban Ki-moon urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they showed in addressing the Iran nuclear program and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
Eight poll results that show that Donald Trump is not kidding
Some tried to put a provocateur tag on it.
Others rejected it as a joke.
Some of them are demanding scandal.
But as much as some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's position in the polls, they have failed (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's advantage in double-digit numbers, and some are seriously asking what that means for a real estate mogul in terms of his chances of getting nominated.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means Trump has a chance to run for the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry was giving up his preference to the growing popularity of Herman Kane, none of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would run in the general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Supercommittee on Political Activity and the economic conservative Growth Club recognize Trump's unwavering power and start to raise their dollars to overthrow him.
Here are some survey numbers that show that the real estate mogul is not just an intermediate phase:
The Trump-like ratings have been up 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University found that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of this real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans are positive about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these numbers are outperforming in the early stages.
Quinnipiac's poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there have a strong view of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would like Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump were to run.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "disappointed" if he ran.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would "be excited" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next in line for excitement?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they would be "dissatisfied" or "disappointed" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush ran.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters across the country think the tycoon has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll by ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure is in the nation's first closed-door meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same person who could be the commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think he's not the person who can be effective in office, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament is not right for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to this.
When they put on their know-it-all hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
When asked who was the most likely winner of the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's not the case anymore, since four out of 10 were put on the Bush Jeep in late July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters didn't have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the last round of the round, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported Mitt Romney.
However, it shows that many GOP voters believe Trump's campaign is convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to unite around another candidate, Trump would still be ahead of everyone else.
Some experts suggest that this spread is likely to play to Trump's advantage, and at the same time those who do not support Trump are evenly distributed among those who support more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in the hypothetical one-on-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets majority support.
He is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally, 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's not in a relationship with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who's been bypassing him?
Ben Carson outscored the businessman by 19 points in the hypothetical one-on-one competition.
A little over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll conducted Tuesday shows that only more than half of Trump supporters say they are confident in their voices.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change things, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense competition at the moment is with his fellow neurosurgeon, Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their minds are more likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "violents" two months ago in his campaign opening speech, immigration has become the most talked about topic in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's contempt will discourage key Latino voters from the Republican Party and hinder rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So as long as immigration is getting public attention, it looks like Donald Trump will stay in the same position.
Disappointment with the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of about half of Republican voters, mostly because of their outsiders status.
Six out of 10 Republicans on Monday in a new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than someone with experience in government.
And they're also offended by Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago found that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with the Republican activities in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "outraged".
The government will decide the fate of pension indexing in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for ways to implement the law on indexing pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation.
She noted that a decision should be reached by October 8, the time the next year's budget bill is submitted to the government.
In addition, the cabinet discusses the option of extending the decision to freeze the accumulated pension of Russians.
Hunger noted that the amount of pension savings is 350 billion rubles.
That's about the same as the full pension indexing for next year.
According to the deputy prime minister, there is no final decision on who should pay the unemployment contributions.
Hunger is of the opinion that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to the socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not quite fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are the ages so often irritable and red?
The doctor-ophthalmologist Tatyana Levashov answers:
Our eyes are screens that protect the eyeball from the many tiny particles that settle on them.
Forgetting about regular centuries-long cleansing, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The output is simple:
Do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, wear a special wet wet wipes for age.
Clean the edges of the centers of the centers of the damaging substances that have accumulated in the day at least once or twice a day.
Cleaning procedures should also be supplemented with warm compresses with herbal herbs (shalfe, chamomile), which soften the thick secretion of the salivary glands, and then massage the edges of the veins, which should be carried out with circular movements of the fingers' pillows;
Do not use alcohol when washing your makeup.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to a further thickening of the salivary gland secretion.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear developers have created a nuclear warhead.
North Korean officials said the country's main nuclear reactor - the Yongben nuclear complex - is operating "at full capacity".
The news was published on the website of the country's Central Telegraph Agency.
It notes that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to "US aggression and nuclear threat", and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "both in quantity and in quality".
The last nuclear weapons test by North Korean authorities was conducted in 2013.
At the same time, there have been no plans to restart the reactor's full operation since then.
Pyongyang claims to have managed to create a nuclear warhead.
The DPRK has also conducted several tests of medium and short-range missiles, polit.ru reports.
Zhirinovsky demanded that the mention of brotherly peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the national anthem should remove the mention of the union of brotherly peoples.
He said this during the State Duma meeting, reports "Russian news service".
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"It's a very long hymn, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand it", Zhirinovsky said.
The deputy believes it is necessary to remove all four-letter words containing this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be replaced with "God, the king keeps", and the Russian tricolor should be replaced with the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Assad has called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad believes that if Europe is to tackle the refugee problem, it must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether Europe accepts or rejects refugees, but whether the root causes of the problem must be addressed.
If Europeans care about the fate of refugees, they should stop supporting terrorists.
That's our opinion on the issue.
"That's the essence of the refugee issue", he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in the name of reaching consensus.
But if we want real success, it's not possible until people die, until the bloodshed continues, and until people feel completely safe.
"So we can reach consensus, but we can't do anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria", Assad stressed.
Recall that about 500,000 migrants have arrived in the EU this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission has stated that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since World War II.
It is not excluded that thousands of Islamic State militants may be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their own cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The residents of the German city have organized a holiday for refugees.
Germany has been the leader in the last month in accepting refugees, although it has recently increased border controls to contain their influx.
Authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts say that the numbers are significantly higher.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the town of Darmstadt, which has a very warm reception for migrants.
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut in the Prime Minister's Question Session
After Mr. Corbin 's election , his debut at the session of questions is expected with great impatience .
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will soon address the Prime Minister for the first time at a question session, for the first time ever, in a match with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of six questions in the afternoon, and his speech will likely be closely watched by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for "less theater and more facts" at the weekly demonstration speech.
He also said he could skip some meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbin's first parliamentary test as a leader; it will follow his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual trade union congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent during the performance of the national anthem at the service on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary celebration of the Battle of Britain, drew criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament and was the subject of several leading newspaper articles.
Mr. Corbin 's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention .
Mr Corbin's press secretary said he "stood in honorable silence" and acknowledged "the Royal Air Force's heroism in the Battle of Britain".
However, Shadow Cabinet member Corbin Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "independently" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play for Mr. Corbin, voicing disagreements over economic, defense and international policy issues, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party members supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also "sitting in the lap" of the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment to the European Union and the government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbyn said at the trade union conference that the Labour Party had made amendments to abolish the idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later Mr Smith, the shadow Minister for Labour and Pensions, said that the party had "full clarity" that it was only opposed to the government's plans to cut the upper limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron will meet at the Courier Box in the last ten years since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he "attracted collective resources" to get ideas for Mr Cameron's questions and received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from the Islington North constituency said that the Prime Minister's questions were causing excessive confrontation and that he would also refrain from witty answers and exchanging tears, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Economy Minister in the Shadow Cabinet, will replace him on questions to the Prime Minister when he is absent - for example, when Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to speak if possible, saying he was speaking to House Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to move away from the political style of "fair talk", often associated with the process of asking questions to the prime minister, but admitted years later that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's questions have been a key indicator of the leader's views, his ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics say it has become a caricature and requires large-scale reforms.

£1 is rising as wages in the UK rise
The pound rose amid rising wages in the UK, while the FTSE 100 index rose thanks to the SABMiller offer.
Between May and June, wages in the UK, minus bonuses, rose 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the highest since 2009, and was met as a delay in forecasts for possible quotation growth.
The pound sterling grew by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505, and by 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index has risen to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
The overall background was SABMiller shares, which rose 20% due to a purchase offer from competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the world's two largest brewing companies, bringing together brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's stock rose 0.9% amid encouraging news from a competing group of luxury-grade manufacturers Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures have surpassed all expectations and show that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - have started to rise again.
Glencore shares rose 5% after the mining giant announced that it had managed to raise $2.5 billion by placing shares, which was done as part of a debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the paper and packaging group Mondi were the leaders in the index's fall - by 4.3 percent - after Goldman Sachs lowered the group's rating to "sell".
JD Sports' shares rose after a sportswear supplier reported an 83 percent increase in pre-tax profits in six months to £46.6 million.
JD Sports says higher wages could hamper expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in labor costs, he says.
The costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash is launching a campaign from below to fight Aldi's pressure.
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's assault in South Australia and Western Australia.
A wholesale food supplier from below has launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of the upcoming $700 million Aldi round.
As Aldi prepares to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and at events such as the Adelaide Show.
The campaign is joined by retailers and IGA suppliers such as Simmo's, a Dancesboro ice cream maker that delivers ice cream at IGA stores, and shop owners who discount regular South Australian Football League tickets.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29th, the day that the wholesale food, beverage and household goods supplier will be hosting its annual investor strategy day.
Much has been put on the line, as IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Consumers in South and Western Australia are known for their routine routes, so the market here is more favourable to IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - over 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 percent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all players present, but mainly independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirrat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales a year, and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, with sales of $500 million and $600 million in those markets, respectively.
Losses in revenue and sales of food products at a high level of constant costs could cost Metcash about 13 million earnings before interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat said.
Meanwhile, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mostly to Aldi and Coles, and that's despite a recent study by Morgan Survey finding that IGA has the most loyal customers.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash's food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, senior fund manager Hamish Douglas, founder of Magellan Financial Group, noted at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "could very likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash has declined to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas' comments.
But it's believed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has declined from 18 percent in 2010 to 14 percent, and Metcash's revenue from the food business, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 percent since 2012 due to operational delivery and sales and profitability pressures.
However, the company has not given up, spending more than $150 million annually to match retail prices at Coles and Woolworths for a thousand positions each week and helping IGA retailers redevelop their shopping malls, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh produce and a wider selection of branded food.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says that price alignment and redevelopment are gaining momentum, and he hopes the company will see net profit increase in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly injured in a recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more credit than critics for his behavior, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Cockinackis, the youngest of the talented duo and often referred to as the "Special Ks", inadvertently came to the limelight because of Kiryos's embarrassing fight with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, during a hot Cincinnati qualifier, the referee on the tower had to tear Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison apart twice, with Harrison stating, "Wawrinck had to put Kirros on his shovels, and I had to put this guy on his shovels".
Since Cockinaks was last seen breaking a rocket after a concussion in his leg saved Richard Gask from a possible US Open defeat, Healy has been a loyal defender of Cockinaks.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second to Bernard Tomich in the singles in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I'm very concerned about one thing, which is that the Tanas have been drawn into the conflict", Healy said.
He really broke a racket when he had his leg down at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break a racket when hopes were dashed, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But he actually did very well in pretty provocative situations in the US, with Harrison, and so on, and I'm sure he deserves to be trusted.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he's a very hard worker, he's a great team fit, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected off the court, he's a very intense trainer, he's in great shape, he's a very purposeful and developed young man, and I think he should be judged for his worth.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiros for an important match starting on Friday, believing "both sides agree" was the right outcome for everyone, but expecting the Canberra guy to return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the game, not the disputes around [Kiros]", Healy said.
And I think Nick's gained momentum very quickly, as people like Federer and Marrey prove, he's growing up in front of the audience, he's made a number of serious mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and we need to, I think, take him out of the spotlight for a while so he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes border, detained migrants
Hungary, which declared a state of emergency, closed its border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter the country illegally to contain the flow of migrants.
There were riots at the border - hundreds of migrants had gathered on the border, which was sharply negatively reviewed by the Serbian authorities.
Trapped indefinitely on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland broke their tents and settled in the area.
However, the discontent grew.
As a police helicopter circled over them, migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian special police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister has declared it "unacceptable" to send migrants back from Hungary, as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not the accompanying damage.
We need to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days", said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after the 28-nation bloc failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to be jointly responsible for 40,000 people seeking asylum in crowded Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that an agreement would be reached in the future (next month or by the end of the year) under which EU member states would accept 120,000 more refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded on Tuesday that an emergency EU summit be convened next week to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, does not hope for any immediate action from Brussels or its neighbors.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave the authorities more power to act on the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Cijartó said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence at the Romanian border to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has completed the fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even the prisoners were connected to emergency work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become a major "narrow place" and border crossing point for the European Union for migrants, many of whom are refugees - victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees - victims of war and having the right to protection, and this view is sharply different from the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, now criminalize crossing or damaging a 4-meter (13 foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison terms for those accused of human trafficking.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Seged.
We make it clear that crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Parliament has yet to formally approve the deployment of troops, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters who are at the border have been watching for days the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs.
Orbán's national security adviser, Djerdi Bacondi, said authorities had arrested 45 people trying to cross the border at the border itself and 15 others inside the country.
They crossed the border, broke the fence, are currently in police custody and are charged with administrative offences under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven crossings on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, bringing in a railway wagon wrapped in barbed wire to block one.
Riots broke out on the main border crossing near the town of Rjysk, Hungary, as Hungarians placed a service room inside a metal container to let people through, and crowds of people pressed each other to break in.
About 20 people managed to get inside, while thousands of people were left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway from Serbia to Hungary and announced a ban on food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernard Sanders has doubled in national polling
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-figure lead in the Democratic nomination race across the country, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is beating her.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among primary Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who hasn't announced whether he's running for president yet, gets 15 percent of the primary Democratic voters.
More than five months before the primary election, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided on the candidate they'll support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in their election than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support to some demographic groups, and Sanders has gained some bonuses.
Clinton holds a large advantage over women and moderates, but that advantage has diminished.
Her male support has dropped substantially, and Sanders is only five points behind her.
The preference given to Clinton by Democratic voters under 50 is gone, and he and Sanders are now on a par.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among older voters.
Clinton outnumbered Sanders by two points among the Liberals last month, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in that group.
Almost half of primary Democratic voters across the country say they would be enthusiastic about Clinton if she were the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she's a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more contradictory - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of primary Democratic voters say they would have enthusiastically supported Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked an open question about why they want her to run, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that it's time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she's the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also talk about an association linking her to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also called a consensus on questions and election chances.
As the vice president contemplates potential election participation, 57 percent of primary Democratic voters would like him to join the race - although a third believe he shouldn't.
When asked who they'd like to see run for second place among the party's candidates, the primary Democratic voters most often refer to Biden.
More than half of Clinton supporters say they would choose Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the contestants to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure has dropped from 78 percent last month.
By that score, Biden is second behind, but the percentage of those who think he's the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in answering the question of what is most important in a candidate, Democratic voters choose other options besides the chance of being elected.
Similar to last month's situation, none of the Democratic or potential candidates are an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have performed well in some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden leads the three in honesty, and Clinton's strength is her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of primary Democratic voters do not consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have a definite opinion on him on that matter.
Early Democratic voters also generally considered Clinton, Sanders, and Biden's ideological views to be similar.
By all these measures, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton's personal email and server in her tenure as Secretary of State continue, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe it did not negatively affect their overall opinion of her.
But that's a very different story for the American public at large.
Half of Americans today are unhappy with its explanation, and only about a third are.
Public opinion of the story was divided in March, shortly after it became known.
Most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has deteriorated.
It's mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10, who say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by voters from her party, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than in May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider her honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country don't consider Trump honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, both get good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush show the best results for honesty.
Most people see Sanders as an honest man rather than not, but like Carson, many people have no opinion about him.
The margin of error for selecting 351 primary voters is 6 percentage points.
According to a national poll, Ben Carson has come close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson approached Donald Trump closely in the latest CBS/New York Times poll.
These two candidates got half the votes in the new poll, leaving the rest to look for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump, whose support has increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll on the eve of a debate on Fox News last month to 27% in a Tuesday poll.
But Carson jumped from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is supported across all demographic groups, pushing Trump into the category of highly educated Republican voters.
The other candidates, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, backed down along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio together rank third with 6%.
The margin of error for selecting 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is a plus-minus 6%, the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson's rise in polls - showing 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson's growing support last week, Trump made several critical comments about the former neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said last Saturday during the Iowa campaign closure.
Five members of the fraternity are charged with the murder of Baruch College freshman
About two years after the death of a college student during a fraternity ritual in Mount Poconno, Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
"Pie Delta Psi fraternity members at Baruch College of New York brutally attacked Chan "Michael" Deng during the dedication ceremony in September 2013 and failed to deliver him to the hospital in time, resulting in his death", police said.
Officials say the blindfolded student with a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed several times as he tried to reach his goal by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity didn't call 911, when Deng passed out, and they waited an hour before they could take him to the hospital, police said.
They, however, took time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, to ask the council, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, the brothers began to hide their personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the brotherhood above the health of Michael Deng", said Chief Wagner.
He was unable to be rescued and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered multiple blunt force trauma to the head, torso, and hip.
"Too many families have suffered as a result of the fraternity dedication rituals, as at least one student has died during them every year since 1970", said Douglas Feuerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The Monroe County jury has pleaded guilty to third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with assault and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only individual participants to account, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned all this officially or unofficially, it is also an organization", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the nationwide fraternity excluded the local chapter from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
There's a rate hike, and the bull market will collapse, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take before the attack, and how long it will last.
For economics in particular, history has little to do with time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for a full 86 months.
The Fed's rigidity in raising rates often, though not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
So the administration of the U.S. Central Bank is so adamant that investors should focus not on when it starts raising rates, but on how long it takes to adapt.
Actually, there are a lot of variables in the game.
Eventually, however, market participants may find that the whole bullshit around raising rates is exaggerated.
"The Federal Reserve's first rate hike with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the 'cheap money' era", said Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics, in a commentary for clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of interest rates in the United States to more normal but still low levels to be a seismic momentum that many fear.
That doesn't mean there won't be consequences.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy might have reacted to historical trends:
As the market has seen in the last month or so, expecting rates to rise can lead to volatility for a while.
When the rate is raised, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It does not appear that the stock yields have slowed for 12 to 24 months after the first leap, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the Federal Reserve's rate hike.
Specifically, if the market has changed more sharply over the past 35 years or so - about 14 percent - toward higher rates, stays fairly flat for 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returns to normal with an average return of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Dole, chief stock strategy officer at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the yield for securities tends not to become more pronounced immediately at the rate hike stage, and earnings from stocks begin to decline.
Recessions are a fact of life, but higher rates often play a role in them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is put in a situation that didn't exist before and could accelerate the recession.
Basically, gross domestic product will be at its lowest point almost for the entire duration of the rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6% in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it's going to be long, even though it's only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed, in the third quarter.
Raising rates in such a volatile economic environment can be risky and raises the question of whether this time will be different, Deutsche reported.
Market participants are preparing for the Federal Reserve's annual rate hike, with their sights set on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve the rate hike at this meeting, futures trading only speaks of a 25 percent probability.
"In our study from 1950 to the present, all rates have been in the supercycle of increasing financial leverage at GDP, which is closing down the recession-preceded peaks very quickly after recovery", the report says.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in a given period.
The current cycle is the longest the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record is 35 months, 74 months long and still unfinished.
Fixed income has also become volatile as the market expects rates to rise, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one that is implemented for stocks.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds will be faster than it is on stocks when the Federal Reserve changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems like yield changes the vector immediately after the first rate hike/fall in the cycle.
At the end of the rate hike cycle, bond yields immediately fall", Deutsche reports.
Strategists at Charles Schwab believe that higher rates will bring the yield levels of long-term and short-term bonds closer together, making the curve flatter.
High-yield bonds often perform better in this climate, although "we still fear volatility", says a study by Katie Jones, a Schwab fixed income analyst.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected outcomes of the Federal system's policies.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market is adjusting to the prospect of tighter monetary policy", she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market with the tightening of the Federal system.
In general, companies that do their main business in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be in a worse position because the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global marketplace and their debt more expensive in the financial world.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks show performance above market levels within three months of the initial rate hike", Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Companies with stable financial status outperformed companies with unstable status on the results of each rate hike in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also showed better performance than low-quality stocks, averaging 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points) respectively.
The debt will be a big deal.
High-interest companies with floating interest rates lose the most, Goldman says.
In addition to purely exchange-traded transactions, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Investors could see a return through higher returns, too, although experts differ on how quickly that will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM", says Conservative MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticized the station for "lowering standards"
It proves that it's becoming less and less distinct from the commercial competitor.
Also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying the award is just a nod to the Brits
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins, who came to The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM", the MP leader said, urging the broadcaster to prove that it is doing something commercial companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC management that it seems that the public radio station is "going on being stupid" and becoming less and less distinct from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'simplification' - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM", he said.
It also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples that I first came up with, where you're actually just copying what's already on the market", Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC Director-General denied the allegations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rival when it came to live music and audience education.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not learning about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performance and making music is truly unmatched by anyone.
"It's also really important, I think, that Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and promoting new works", he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that radio stations had to work much harder to attract audiences than in the past because Britons were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child to be attacked for stepping on commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because of its lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in "the typical BBC style".
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit in her own home stable" the next time she launches an entertainment project.
However, he does not see the need to prevent the ordering of new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the licence fee for other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales slowed in August, and Black Friday could be the cause.
Online sales increased by seven percent in the first three months of 2015
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began in 2000.
Online sales were up three years ago with the use of mobile devices for shopping.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could help curb spending.
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many of Britain's central streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are signs of a downward trend in online sales now, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping spending in August showed the lowest growth since it began in 2000, rising by just five percent.
Experts say there are now signs of a downturn in online sales after the latest data showed a mere seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000, they always had a reasonable explanation", said Andy Malkahi, editor of IMRG's sales index, to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people were able to buy online, and that they could do it in any situation, like sitting on a couch.
But now it's coming out on the plateau, and you can see the decline.
The Black Friday phenomenon that came from America is cited as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that shoppers may have refrained from shopping on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times as many shoppers rushed to their computers to take advantage of the good offers, breaking down a number of vendor websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers are engaged in a real shopping battle, could have forced people to refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over £1 out of every 5 is spent online.
In terms of products like TVs and washing machines, more than a third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are more willing to buy clothes and shoes online than they are in the fashion stores on the main streets.
Muslims bury dead in a crane crash in Mecca, and sanctions on the family of bin Laden
Muslims carrying bodies of 29 dead on the streets as the first burial begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the accident.
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the world flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims of the crane crash at the main mosque in Mecca.
The mostly white-clad attendants filled the hallway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who made their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The mourning procession passed by the holy site, where just a few days earlier a construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were given for burial, and at the same time the Saudi king fined the construction company owned by the Ben Laden family for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
29 parishioners killed in the crane collapse in the main mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Casim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Main Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman announced that Binladin Group should not have left the arrow of the crane raised when the crane was not working.
The Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press, says that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the collapse.
The English news agency did not give details, but it said that the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the cause of the crane's fall in the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go to Hajj this month.
Binladin Group has made no statements regarding the crane's collapse, and its representatives have been found unavailable for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and of not agreeing properly with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the massive construction work being carried out by the Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been a close ally of Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and has been leading major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader Osama bin Laden was a son-in-law whose family abandoned him in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in heavy winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials have decided to pay one million rials (about £174,000) to the relatives of the dead, and the same amount to the irrevocably injured.
The other victims will get half of that.
The head of B&Q claims the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European craftsmen working for little money
According to Veronique Lowry, the British are increasingly hiring repairers.
Eastern European skilled workers are growing
The result is the opening of over 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals .
At the same time , Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores across the country .
Author: Rupert Steiner, the chief city correspondent for the Daily Mail
They say the British put aside hammers and paintbrushes and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do the housework.
If you can handle a hammer or paint a wall, you seem to be in the minority these days.
Because, according to the B&Q company, Britons are increasingly hiring skilled craftsmen to do the simple chores at home.
Veronica Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a home furnishing service network, said that behind this trend is a significant influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in craft goods and close 60 B&Q warehouses at the same time.
Ms. Lori said she would like to see more women on the staff of B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions are made by women of the weaker sex.
Most of the staff is now men.
She said that the latest demographic trends are also being seen, with more single women in households setting up their homes than ever before.
Mrs. Lori said, "Our stores are still mostly male.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the decisions about our products are made by women.
Women play a big role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of five women at the helm of leading British companies whose shares are listed on the FTSE 100 Index, has also changed the top management team to achieve an equal number of men and women among directors.
Kingfisher is the only company in the world where women make up 50 percent of its executive management, including its CEO and chief financial officer.
Mrs. Laurie said, "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding the right women on the board was easy.
After the group took over the cost of closing stores, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales in six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores.
Time of decision on the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting to decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists found that just over half of those who thought the Fed would do it last week now believe it will still delay and keep rates in the current range of 0 to 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event, because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve cut the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the central bank can move from zero and start the process of normalizing interest rates", said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working efficiently, the economic boom adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore the impact of the decision on the global economy.
He warned the markets that they should prepare for change, but it all shows their confidence that there is a good chance against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 8pm CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees are coming to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" shouted hundreds of refugees at the Khorgosh checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Budapest has closed its border to the displaced since Tuesday.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to see other routes to the European Union.
One of them is through Romania, bypassing the closed border with Serbia.
The other one is through Croatia and Slovenia to Austria.
According to some reports, the buses that carried refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now headed to the city of Shidu on the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojša Stepanović assures that his country is doing everything it can to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to keep Serbia safe as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, provide them with a humane treatment.
But it is a European problem.
It's not easy to solve, no country in Europe can do it alone, especially a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is adamant:
If you claim to be a refugee, you must complete the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed in our country because Serbia is perfectly safe.
Hungary has already built a 175-kilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to build a similar barrier on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already declared that this is incompatible with European principles.
WANGELIS MEIMARAKIS: "Europe wants to help us".
Vangelis Meimarakis was for a number of years a member of right-wing centrist governments that led, according to the left, the country to financial crisis.
Now, as the interim leader of the New Democracy party, he challenges Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with the journalist Euronews.
Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to the Euronews!
WANGELIS MAYMARAKIS: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by giving up the Syriza coalition, but now, according to polls, New Democracy has been compared to it in popularity.
What's changed in that time?
WANGELIS MAYMARAKIS: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
Now the country is again running a budget deficit and high unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras kicked them out.
For the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in the country in January and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what was promised to what actually happened.
Everyday life has become markedly worse than in January, when the situation improved, and this has affected most Greek citizens.
But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including Syriza.
WAM: The point is that, as we've learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all the other countries where rescue programs were or are still in place, political forces and all the ruling parties came together to implement a program on which they reached agreement, without renouncing their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Your party voted in favor of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you keep this agreement, or will you try to change it at least in part?
WANGELIS MAYMARAKIS: We actually voted for Greece to move on to the European path because we have a good idea of the devastating consequences of leaving the EU.
Now Europe is helping us by subsidizing our farmers for their produce, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and help in the banking sector.
All this would have been lost without a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Tsipras' negotiating.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
So if Europe sees that the new Greek government wants to put order in the first year of power, acts rationally and shows that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then I am sure that all the commitments that have been made that cannot be fulfilled because of what leads to the recession can be negotiated again, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to assume that in the first year of the new agreement we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue the privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, while continuing to benefit from EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found out when discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farmers' incomes.
We explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that Tsipras' ministers never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were unprepared and ill-informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and to reach an agreement.
If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Mrs. Merkel, Hollande and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them differ from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
WANGELIS MAYMARAKIS: First of all, I want to explain to them that by the end of 2014, we were trying to do the best we could to implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners.
We were pushing for reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in an emergency.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price the Greek government agreed.
I was the speaker of parliament at the time, and I was able to agree the views of the three parliamentary groups that were the government majority at the time.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a functioning parliament, and that was in the presence of populists and extremists, and mass demonstrations outside.
And we've managed to get the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general election that resulted from the December presidential election.
In recent weeks, a massive influx of refugees has been moving through Greece.
What do you think about this situation and the reaction of the European countries that these people are seeking?
WANGELIS MAYMARAKIS: The refugee crisis is a slow-acting bomb that we're going to have to deal with after we win the election.
The reason is that the Syrian government has not acted properly in this situation.
You should be on the lookout for such matters, because if you are faced with a problem, you are left with only emergency measures.
And that's exactly where we are right now.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZA has done more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras has done in seven months.
I am sure that the actions of the provisional government, which is being given valuable assistance by the president of the republic, who called for the EU summit, will allow us to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees are allowed to leave the country, and notice, refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are victims of the war in Syria, victims of some kind of emergency that happened to them.
This is a deeply humanitarian issue, and we will continue to take the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
The relevant decision must be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations must be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this pressing problem.
Mr. Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Wenger: Thank you very much.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkovka in Donetsk region, during a day, the Criminal Investigation Department of the region's Main Police Department together with the military counterintelligence established and detained a suspect, a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Kriva Rog (Dnepropetrovsk region), who last night during a joint consumption of alcoholic beverages and the conflict in the village of Verkhneterek of the Yasinovatic district, shot Donetchin from an automatic weapon in his opponent.
The 22-year-old was reportedly injured in a hospital where he was hospitalized with a gunshot wound to the leg.
According to Artem Vasitsky, deputy head of the police department of the police head of the region, during the operational actions, law enforcement proved the involvement of the person in another serious criminal offence - the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The police determined that on the same day, a conflict broke out between the suspect and another local resident, resulting in a fatal gunshot wound to the head.
The investigation department of the Druzhkovsk State Department has opened a criminal case under the articles "Deliberate murder" and "Deliberate causing serious bodily harm" of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The prisoner faces up to 15 years in prison.
The fugitive was detained and placed in a temporary detention center, the Donetsk region police press service reported.
Two residents of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments, including two to Vladimir Lenin, in the colors of the Ukrainian flag, have been sentenced by a Russian court to prison.
Two other city residents were sentenced to life in prison.
The residents of Novosibirsk who received prison terms were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicts were given 14 and 18 months' imprisonment.
The Novosibirsk court found four citizens guilty of vandalism against the Lenin monuments located on the territory of the KPRF's precinct and on the street of the Tricotage, as well as the Memorial complex "Memorial of Glory".
In the latter case, the "Katyusha" missile installation and the T-34 tank were painted.
Recall that on the night of December 12 in Novosibirsk, Russia, unknown people painted the military equipment on the Monument of Glory in Ukrainian flag colors.
The civil wife of popular Russian actor Eugene Tsyganow, Irina Leonova, gave birth to her seventh child.
The girl was born in one of the Moscow clinics.
The newborn and her mother are feeling good.
Let me remind you, recently, the Gypsy and Leonov broke up.
Eugene refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambitions.
Eugene Tsiganov is 36 years old.
He is an actor of the Moscow theater "Petro Fomenko's Workshop".
He is known for his films "Promoting", "Cosmos as a Preview", "Brest Fortress", "Ottepel" and "Fars".
On September 8, Eugene Tsyganov was recognized as "Actor of the Year" and "Man of the Year" by the Russian version of the popular magazine GQ.
The man who opened fire at Delta State University left a note apologizing.
After the shooting and murder of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he "regrets" the first murder and would like to "give it all back", authorities said Tuesday.
Police in the city of Gotha, Mississippi, report that a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University called 911 at about 10 a.m.
Monday and reported that he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He reported, "I killed my wife last night", and also mentioned that there was a "dog" in the house that "didn't touch anyone", but he was probably upset.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened fire.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, that said, "I'm sorry. I'd like to get it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and then on Monday night, when he was surrounded by police, he committed suicide.
University Rector William Laforge said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something in mind".
Despite Monday's reports that Lamb was suggesting an affair between Prentice and Schmidt, officials said Tuesday that "no information or evidence" of a "love triangle" had been found.
O'Printicis was described as a "good man" by Sean O'Stein, who reportedly had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they're still friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentice had a daughter who was 19 and that she was "disgusting".
He added that Prentice and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsay Knowles, who the Sun Herald calls Prentiss' close friend, Prentiss worked from home over the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She's always wanted to help people".
According to police, Lamb called his relatives on Monday at some point to say that "he's not going to jail".
The same evening that police caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb pulled over, jumped out, ran into the woods, and shot himself.
According to a resume posted on the university's website, Lamb received a PhD in pedagogy from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who lost their luck
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had some difficult years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his longtime life partner, Farru Fawcett, who died of cancer.
The actor reportedly also suffered from a drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly played a part.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United has been out for a few months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about being unable to get on the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw can play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless 15-minute kickback when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penalty area.
He was treated in the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture, and he's in the hospital".
He'll be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or a day later, and then operated on.
It's terrible - a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and started playing fantastic, and that's what happened.
He had an oxygen mask in his dressing room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months, and the guy can't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and no penalty.
The referee, Nicola Ritzoly, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
That was a very bad two-legged kick.
In a tweet, Shaw wrote, "Thank you all for your messages, words to describe how devastated I am, my journey to recovery begins, I will return even stronger than I was".
Manchester United is suffering a misfortune with Luke Shaw after losing a game against PSV
The English defender will have an extra boost to qualify for the European Championship in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Coco said, "It's a very serious injury".
When any player is out with this kind of injury, everyone's very upset about it.
It was never our players' intention to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while playing for Mexico against the Dutch team under Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's having a hard time now because he didn't mean to hurt the opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, you feel bad", Koko said.
I didn't get a chance to see the moment.
All I could see was a ball that was flying in a different direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched it, but I didn't see the pod under Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to bear.
It's very hard for me, and I'm very sorry.
Andres Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Lorax?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: If your child likes a book, it will take a while for you to learn it almost by heart.
Unless you are David Cameron, I guess.
When asked by a company that organizes children's vacation holidays about his favorite children's book, the prime minister chose "Lorax", an environmental-friendly tale written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a commentary posted on SuperCamps' website, and he continues, "This is a fun, moving, unusual story with a strong message that I love to read to my children because it always reveals some image or message that we miss".
And all would be fine except for the last paragraph where Cameron is supposed to re-tell the book, but actually tells the story of the 2012 film of the same name, with new characters and details added to diversify the fairly short original narrative.
"In the walled town of Allmusterville, where there was no greenery and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree", says the text, describing an unknown love story of Dr. Seuss (real name Theodore Seuss Geisel), who died in 1991.
If that doesn't sound suspicious enough, Cameron's lyrics read almost like a short story for the movie "Lorax" posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the walled town of Allmusicville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams".
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being a generally accepted active parent, would be so unfamiliar with the contents of the book that an unnamed boy would learn about the environmental destruction of the greedy logger and weaver "the all-numb" Nahodkins, despite protests by Lorake (whose name is taken from the book's title) - a funny creature with moustaches who "speaks for the trees".
It's likely that this simple PR task was assigned to a performer who had never read a book about Lorakx to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comment was made.
For Adam Lita, there was a risk of not being in England, but it's still a difficult question.
Winning against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but looking at the team England has chosen for this tour, repeating the 3-0 test series that happened last time, it doesn't seem likely to me.
I wouldn't rule out a win on my own field either.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it has players who are virtuoso with the balls and strong collective thinking; they will not bring the scars of 2012 with them, only the youthful positives.
With the ball, Moen Ali becomes a bowler who delivers the balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Adam Leath has been dropped from England 's Test cricket team and replaced by Alex Hayles .
The decision to fire Adam Lith, his head coach at Yorkshire, is of course difficult to analyze.
His seven Tests were two good strikes in difficult conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality is that cricketers are judged by the result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've said it before) players are best at choosing themselves.
A couple hundred and a half, and Lita could have expected a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more hits for Yorkshire, another chance will arise.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss spoke well of his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team player first, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take for a Test cricket batsman to make an impression is a difficult one.
Lith played in seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton in nine.
Compton was the only one who got a chance to play on his own and on someone else's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England picked Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Leet was in his best form, but that missed opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a great batsman.
He's an unpredictable cricketer, like we saw at Yorkshire earlier this season, when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which was something.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those who came before him, but that will, of course, depend on the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would allow for an extra spin, keeping four fast bowlers, is being considered, and I'm not against it at all.
I don't see any reason why a batting player can't hit the ball in there, and this left-hander has already proven himself to be a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what they need for their Worcestershire county, but he's been number three for them, and it doesn't make much difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests as a third-class batsman before leaving as a starter in 2001.
He won three hundred at once and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a backup spinner, and in my short conversation with him, he seemed to me to be a very promising young man.
People can look at his statistics -- 31 on average with a bat and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risky bet, but there's a small percentage of the spinners who vote "yes", and the picks are young.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
Appointing Mahela Jaawardine, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for Test matches could be a masterpiece.
He's one of the best guys in the game, bringing in the richest experience he's got in any situation and any attack.
Paul Collingwood is in the white-ball game and will provide both energy and relentless pace in the setup.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it was a game or a coaching job, and like Machel, he had a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what they've said before, can give the team new strength.
Teammates on the Durham Ben Stokes team are off for one day, Ruth is given a similar break for Australia, and I, for example, have no problem with that.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and players' selectors do not define the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their position depends on the outcome.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The UK's exit from the EU could win if the economy is in a depression by 2017
David Cameron's ruthless policy of resuming negotiations to keep Britain in the EU is increasingly challenging every day, even without looking back on the election of the brilliant Jeremy - "Is it yes or no?" - Labour leader Corbyn or TUC's outrage over Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners have their own Corbinas and Nigella Farage.
A friendly European diplomat recently explained that in the current situation of the EU, which is experiencing a variety of crises - not all of them of its own making - some member countries are fed up with the British self-centered agenda of making concessions and undermining agreements for changes they don't want.
Gathering in Brighton for the annual meeting, TUC decided it didn't want them anyway if they were destroying social security.
We could even call it a Dave and George selfie program.
The prime minister and the finance minister walk to summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take pictures of themselves against the backdrop of a famous local monument, in the company of a local celebrity or without, then come home and say they're attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain to be interested in maintaining external contacts under the banner of the European Union - "Don't leave us with France", says Berlin - suggests that the ministers and officials in some capitals get to the point where they don't care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the very cautious Chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she's been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before things get worse for her, as they have for the Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kola (16).
France's president Francois Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing his strength, too.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to see them climbing out of their skins to help the self-made British, whose energy could be spent preventing Scotland from leaving Britain - which they don't want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even plan to deliberately issue useless SNP-style remarks during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to spur the UK's exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The review was a fix", and "Britain has received nothing of value from the resumption of negotiations".
Europeans are well aware of the predator that Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the media moguls are about the EU, unlike the 1975 Tony Benn referendum that supported our entry into the EU in 1973 at a 2:1 ratio.
They may be somewhat fond of Boris Johnson, a deep-rooted Euro-opportunist who became famous for his "direct EU bananas" of the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his stupidity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a shady company of tax-scared crooks, phone hackers, and fake nonresidents who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair was of the same opinion about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a bully gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and tea again.
In fact, Millyband was a greater supporter of Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair had acted in principle in favor of the repealed EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who issued him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him for any of this.
But the dear Jeremy Corbyn, who graciously slapped me on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't have time to spend on me anymore - seems to be risking repeating Neil Kinnock's '80s 'boykot to Murdoch' strategy - a mistake both then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a consistent strategy for interaction with the press -- not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose couch he sat on on in the Air Force on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditional cynical Ukip trend and the broader circle of "Little England supporters" among Tories can probably say yes to this.
That's the same thing Hillary said, "Ben, not Bennett", Ben said on radio and TV this week, while his inner boy scout was adamantly refusing to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the unstable John McDonnell as Shadow Secretary of the Treasury was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old man was fighting hard on TV for disloyalty to his Labour cabinet colleagues, not going too far and losing his cabinet post.
The battle of Hilary was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay "under all circumstances" - Ben's phrase - is not what McDonnell said, nor is it what J.K. told parliamentarians and MPs in a private meeting on Monday night, in the public opinion.
Whatever the Democrat and his boyfriend Corbyn wanted to tell me -- remember, he touched me too -- the discipline of message remains important in this age of 24/7 television, and especially in the social media hotspot of paranoia and betrayal.
It's reasonable not to let Cameron just leave Europe, allowing him to take on the Labour side as a proper support during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the main misconception of MacDonnell and Corbyn about EU membership - within the "Benedict" economy of the besieged fortress - is no longer an issue of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism, born of a slight difference, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about NATO -- Tom Watson's unwavering belief that J.K. will not campaign for an exit -- foreign diplomats will be forced to try to get this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on British concessions when it can be pointless?
The United States is already very disappointed with the weak British military operations in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even as the Tory government cuts spending, as I was reminded on Monday during lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of e-cigarettes by Public Health England
The government-funded agency's claims that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than smoking were made at the meeting by 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in conjunction with the Lancet have criticized evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published an important report - a "turning point" last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of evidence".
But some researchers have questioned the validity of the data and pointed to the link between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized the "extremely shaky argument" that PHE based its main conclusion on.
In an article in BMJ, two other researchers questioned whether these claims had "strong or shallow grounds".
Martin McKee, a lecturer in the European Health Organisation at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Cappwell, a lecturer in clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, reported: "The fundamental principle of healthcare - rules should be based on proof of effectiveness".
According to them, the public expects PHE's statements that "the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95 percent less harmful than smoking" to be based on detailed evidence and simulation.
In fact, this is from a single meeting of 12 people who came together to develop a model of multi-criteria decision-making analysis to summarize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Cappwell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also confirmed the BAT certificates in healthcare in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, not mentioning the funding he reportedly received from tobacco company Philip Morris.
No reasonable explanation for the selection of board members was given, but there are several prominent e-cigarette supporters among them, some of whom have also stated that they fund the industry in publications.
It is not known whether the other participants have any experience in tobacco management.
The head of the tobacco sector at PHE also attended the meeting.
The scientific paper published by the group "agrees gracefully" that there is a lack of "weighted evidence of harmful effects of most products on most criteria", wrote McKee and Cappwell.
However, none of these connections and restrictions were affected in the PHE report.
McKee and Cappwell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence at this time that e-cigarettes are a road to smoking for children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and wellness at PHE, said BMJ's statements had been answered earlier.
He said: "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking tobacco".
One of the two smokers died of his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to study the remote effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not prove, especially where the public has doubts about the relative hazard of tobacco.
About 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By making clear what is obvious -- that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they only cause a fraction of the harm caused by smoking -- we are doing our job to the nation.
Former Channel 4 head thinks BBC should end EastEnders
Former Channel 4 head Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop producing programmes like EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would have given much for such successful shows as the soap opera Albert Square.
Johnson noted that the licence fees should only be used to create programs that are not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public broadcasts, which are probably watched by only a small percentage of the audience, on peak times when competitors have high ratings and on channels like BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the corporation would like to work more closely with other organisations, Johnson noted that he had tried unsuccessfully to work with the BBC for six years while working on Channel 4.
"I cannot help but think that the BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting programmes that could be shown by competing companies that are not receiving subsidies", Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of the BBC's further investigation.
If you keep the license fee, which I don't think is a good idea in the medium to long term, then companies should only keep those programs on the air that aren't being released and aren't going to be released by other companies.
The Voice is broadcast in prime time because the creators want the greatest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would show it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to fund transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one example, EastEnders is another; it's common knowledge that they're their own production.
Other channels would certainly have done a lot for her.
I don't understand how this could be a public broadcast.
I don't think it would have brought down the BBC.
Series entrepreneur Johnson, who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "because of employee ambitions and their belief that this is the best way to gain long-term support".
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echo those of Sky's executive director Tony Ball, who in his 2003 Edinburgh MacTaggart memorial lecture suggested the BBC sell EastEnders-style series.
Johnson noted that the more niche public broadcasts of the BBC "continue to go to BBC4, where the audience is often not assessed, but the company's function is done, and this can be presented as an argument in the Hanseatic sermons justifying the £4 billion licence fee revenue: 'Well, yes, of course, we do all these obscure broadcasts that nobody watches.'
They put them in a slot where no one will ever look at them.
On the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system for who gets the most.
Of course, you all think, we all think that £150 a year is a huge sum, but for people who have £150 a lot of money, I wonder, they think that because they don't really watch or listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should review Rita's mission in favour of "inform, educate and entertain".
He noted that only a small part of the BBC's material is now formally classified as educational - he said it is 1% of television content and 0.1% of radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "inform, educate and entertain".
On the partnership issue, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "Promoed Concert" (only a portion of which, he said, is shown on TV), and also enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
"Sonogenetics" allows you to control brain cells using sound waves
The video shows the nematodes changing direction of motion when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have extracted worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using pulses of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are affected by sound pulses too high for the human ear to hear.
The pulses are activated by neurons that have been genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Researchers control brain activity with light
Scientists said the worms demonstrate the potential of a new technique called "sonogenesis", which is to use ultrasound to excite certain brain, heart, and muscle cells, while the source of ultrasound is outside the body.
Srikant Chalsanni, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses to the human brain and is used to treat Parkinson's disease.
The nematodes don't usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalsanni found that they began to respond when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms' bodies.
The amplified ultrasonic waves affect structures called "TRP-4 ion channels" found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, reports a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that could be controlled by ultrasound, Chalsanie made genetic modifications to the worms, so their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
When ultrasound was used to affect modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and introduced into worm organisms, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in optogenetics, a new field that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light pulses.
Chalsanie argues that compared to this method, sonogenesis may have some advantages.
Unlike light that is sent to the right part of the brain via optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves pass through the body's tissues uninterrupted, so they do not need to be delivered through the cranial box.
"We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses to treat certain neurological diseases in clinical settings will temporarily make human neurons sensitive to ultrasound", Chalsanie said.
He added that the technique could also be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment is right on your doorstep!
Advertisements are mocking the British arms trade
Watch the video of Amnesty International protesting the arms show.
That's a great killer drone!
The iron candles that break the nails!
The tape bombs!
Electric light-bulb drums that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The bold voice and the animated animation leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms show is a vicious parody of Amnesty International's attempt to draw attention to the British government's intention to "push" weapons to repressive regimes by using the ExCeL Defence Technology and Security Systems Exhibition in Docklands.
DSEI arms exhibition: authoritarian regimes are heading to London
But the special campaign also leads to a sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and on subway trains that require a fresh look.
"An important announcement coming from the DLR line from September 15 to 18?" - written on one of them in London Underground fonts with the image of the DLR line turning into a silhouette of a tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of gun dealers will be raiding the DLR line asking passengers to help stop the gun show.
300 posters are painted by artists who have exhibited their work at the Cruel Design Museum in Banksy's Desmaland Park.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them around London using a "commercial site hacker kit", a 6-pound set of gay keys that "gives access to about a third of the advertising space at the planet's bus stops".
London's transporters were unhappy with the "vandalism" of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody ads released by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and are striving to bring political art to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists start working with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another gun display poster welcoming passengers to the subway.
The video from Amnesty has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by pro bono agency VCCP, with the help of a graphic designer and voice artist who also work for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence surrounding the gun show - with a miss in the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's get them a campaign they're trying to avoid".
They thought they would create more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but "filling it with bright colors and animation turned out to be a more exciting activity".
"They were incredibly helpful in getting attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition", says Tom Davis of Amnesty International.
Now we need the UK government to take action and ensure that this torture equipment is not sold illegally right on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative artwork on the arms show comes from inside ExCeL, where participants sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed information about an order for the "AT4CS RS shoulder-firing" from the US Army.
It includes "an unparalleled cumulative armour that brings unrivalled barrier action within the target".
Whatever he does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
It's been 11 years since I moved into a boarding school as a normal 19-year-old, still believing in the berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the long smiles of those I've irritated - and the numerous, long complaints about others.
Basically, what I've learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
Moving to the dorm can range from a little nerve-wracking to a little scary.
He encourages chatter: tell people where you came from, whether you took academic leave and where you spent it, whether you support Corbin and why you "honestly, neither love nor hate Marmite, because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract of HAHAHAHA, I'll be home".
Take a break.
And help others to relax too - ask questions and show interest.
It keeps you talking and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if your hair was burning and they were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give the people space.
People's rooms are often converted into pubs, movie theaters and social gatherings, but they're also where people dress and repair their underwear.
And on top of that, don't even think about starting college when you're in a relationship.
Introverts are treated unfairly at universities.
Your room should be a refuge, but many hostels have a culture of room-to-room chatter that promotes friendship, communication, and long-term friendships.
It could be hell for anyone trying to regain their strength.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to keep being friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I can recover the energy I spent communicating with you".
Feel when your classmate is tired of talking and text instead of knocking.
Speaking of knock, do it.
One guy in my dorm followed a rule: If the door was not locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Make friends with baking.
As you start your college life at the height of the Bake-Off show, knocking on the door to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate chip cookies is not that strange anymore, it's not like the 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I've cooked you something, now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions".
Offering home-cooked meals is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and eventually, your face will likely be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, that depends on how good you are as a baker.
Poorly-blinded flour, sugar, and fat boxes will make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Stealing food is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, giving someone a chicken is stealing, but is it stealing to take a little milk for tea?
Check with the milkman.
He will likely suggest that you do not feel ashamed, even if you are angry.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I feel sorry for you, but try to treat this adult like my neighbor who poured dishwasher liquid into her milk to get revenge on those who took it without asking.
She's in prison now.
You must not make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're the same people in the glass house story.
The girl in my hall asked her neighbor to turn down the drum and bass, since it was 3 a.m. and she had her exam in the morning.
The neighbor raised the volume in response.
When he finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let him sleep for two hours, then handed him her music and locked the door behind her, heading for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse lived in the same hostel as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely, uncomfortable, uncomfortable to take your neighbor as your future spouse, get caught up in him, break up with him, and have to see him every day, and maybe watch him pull all your mutual friends to his side?
Of course, you won't tell your heart, but if the hot neighbor is not your future husband, try to cool your own dust a little bit.
The exciting moment when you realize someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between the play and the injury is thinner than you think.
A good game is fun, but it turns into its opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never fill someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close someone's door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you put in the freezer, but don't stick someone's stuff with Blu-Tack to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on an iPhone after an Apple update is released
You can request the new operating system by going to Settings, selecting General, and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will let you download and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error message appears telling them that "Application Update Failed".
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the excitement subsides or try to update through iTunes.
The phone clue will allow you to go through the whole process.
The process may involve removing applications to increase the free space - but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and has also simplified the execution with a special utility that offers to remove applications and reinstall them once the process is complete.
Make sure that your phone is charged or near the charger when you update it to prevent battery discharges.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as unloading the phone in the process could cause the update to fail.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by phone.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
He believes that the military support Moscow is providing to President Assad only exacerbates the conflict.
At the same time, the White House chief is not yet going to talk about it with his Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Assad poses a risk of escalating and prolonging the conflict, and also negatively impacts our common goal of fighting extremism if we also do not continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power", State Department officials said.
They also noted that Kerry reiterated the United States' commitment to the fight against the Islamic State as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member.
In addition, the United States "will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in its attempts to counter the Islamic State".
Last Friday, White House officials said they didn't know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House press secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a phone call between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the president decides that a phone call with President Putin will be in our best interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make that call".
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase its support for the Assad regime a "losing stake".
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he didn't heed my warnings - and the situation got worse", the president said.
The imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating equipment for recreation and sport from customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the ministry on the instructions of the Russian government.
This was reported to the news agency by the assistant minister of economic development Elena Lashkina.
In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following his visit to Crimea, instructed a number of departments - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the FSB, the FTS, and the Rosturism - to prepare proposals to create favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about €200 million annually goes to the European state treasury for maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On amendments to the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from payment of customs duties, taxes", which provides for full conditional exemption from payment of customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sport.
According to the ministry, this will certainly contribute to creating favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, - noted Lashkina.
The issue was brought to the attention of the Sub-Commission on Customs Tariffs, Non-Tariff Regulation, Safeguarding Measures in Foreign Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September and was also approved by the departments.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure of full conditional release in the import is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the sub-commission meeting in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member states of the EAEU, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods that are completely exempt from customs duties and taxes includes goods needed to facilitate foreign economic activity and international cooperation, to be used in the field of science, culture, cinema, sport and tourism, to provide international assistance, etc. Among them are service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), control-measuring instruments, drilling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, moving laboratories and workshops, water skiing, racing cars, motorcycles, sports flying machines, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious ceremonies.
The press service of the Russian Ministry of Transport told "Izvestia" that they have prepared mandatory regulations on the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Euppatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for the entry and exit of small, sporting sailing and cruise ships into the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has instructed the captains of the seaports of Crimea to ensure the application of simplified procedures for entry of small, sporting sailing and cruising vessels into the seaport and exit of the listed vessels from the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has also prepared the draft of the orders of the Russian government on the approval of the boundaries of the waterways of the seaports of Crimea.
The order has already been adopted in relation to Yalta and Feodosiya, while the rest are in the process of being agreed, the ministry's press service said.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state supervision, classification and inspection, state registration of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia, yachting is extremely difficult because of the poor infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, it's a whole growing industry, with a lot of people involved.
In Russia, everything is actually on its way.
Our coast is uninteresting, the only place you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa area.
But the big problem is that the border guard has very strict rules in this area: to go out for a yacht, you have to get a lot of permits.
Besides, inside Russia, the yacht has nowhere to refuel.
She can go with her fuel for two days, and then there's a problem where to get it", says Dennis Novikov, Nordmarine's sales director.
As for the storage of yachts, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special hangars for yachts up to 30 m.
Novikov noted that the buyers of yachts are wealthy people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts decreased.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"The new funding will support a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine", the statement said.
World Bank Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Tsimiao Fan, said the banking sector reforms would help revive real-world lending and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank is seeing the first signs of stabilization.
But due to the seriousness of the problems, Fan urges the Ukrainian government to speed up reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved a loan of €100 million to Ukraine, reports RIA Novosti.
Prisons are being asked to create separate transgender blocks.
The Federal Penal Service (FPS) Public Council on the Protection of the Rights of Convicted Persons will discuss the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transvestite settlements in October 2015.
This was reported to the news agency Vladislav Grib, a member of the board.
According to him, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia who have not identified their gender, domestic prisons can be set up with separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) a special transsexual colony.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to determine the sentence of citizens in such isolated places only after the convicts have passed the appropriate medical examinations that will prove that the criminal is indeed a person who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib believes that isolating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice is successfully operating abroad: in the SIZO (where the accused are in custody before the court's decision) separate transgender cells are provided, and in correctional institutions - special blocks.
Today, it's the only way to deal with these criminals.
They must be isolated, because the presence of transvestites and transgender people in ordinary cells is dangerous for them, it is a sea of suffering for their families and a sea of problems for the FSN personnel.
The humiliation of trance by fellow cameramen is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big the city is, how many criminals with no gender, you have to figure out where to distribute them.
SIZOs are not needed alone - only cells, cells in prisons.
Yeah, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgender people.
According to Grib, the block could contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialised corps is created in Russia alone, transsexuals in prison can serve their sentences from any region.
Citizens are held in the SIZO at the crime scene, so transvestites or transgender people from other subjects during the investigation and trial are unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, says Grib.
Recall that the day before, law enforcement officials could not decide which detention center - male or female - to identify the 24-year-old transgender man Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis) who was arrested for possession of drugs, and the man with a girl's appearance was not arrested.
He was released home on bail.
This news has been widely discussed on social media and in the media, as there is no mechanism for keeping transgender people in detention centres and colonies in Russia.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT activist, Nikolai Alexeev, supported the idea of creating special places for transgender people to serve their sentences, noting that it is also possible to identify people in the colony abroad - male or female - depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in the Russian prisons, the sentence is correct.
Yes, it is a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as is the issue of ensuring security for homosexuals in prisons", says Alexeyev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made in the name of that and for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgender people.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia willing to give up their transsexual identity in order to enter a different colony than the usual ones.
Of course, you can get a medical check-up before you put people in a transgender colony, but it's not always the same.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners, Chelsea Menning, looked like a man, and already in prison, he said he wanted to change his gender, "said Alexeyev.
A person can feel anything.
But while there are no separate places for transgender people to serve their sentences, I doubt prison officials will seriously consider the safety of these people and delve into the intricacies of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health issues in the Russian Federation, Boris Lorдкиpanidze, noted that introducing a new system of distribution of transsexual offenders in the colony could greatly delay the beginning of the sentence by convicts.
A commission is being set up, it's a matter of sexology, psychiatrists are doing long-term monitoring, it's not just a test that makes a high-precision conclusion.
The current psychiatric facilities allow for this.
Therefore, even before changing their sex, potential patients are always subjected to such examinations - they show exactly whether changing their sex with surgery is a necessary measure", says Lordkipanidze.
But I find it hard to imagine how this system would be applied to convicts, because it takes an average of a month to conduct such an investigation.
The doctor, although generally supportive of the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, and transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if you consider that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, you can say that transgender people are even fewer, and those who have such a bias and commit crimes, a negligible number, - said Lordkipanidze.
Now, on petition to the colonial administration, homosexuals and transgender people can be held in solitary confinement.
Mikhail Antipov won the junior world championship in chess.
The chess world championship for juniors under 20 years of age has ended in Khanty-Mansiysk.
The end of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and it was the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to chase the Pole Jan-Kshistof Dudu, who seemed to be confidently heading for the title.
The girls were celebrating the victory of the Ukrainian chess player Natalia Bucks.
The chess world championship, held in Khanty-Mansiysk from the beginning of September, seemed to have lost almost all its intrigue by the middle of the tournament, as Poland's representative Jan-Kshiштоf Duda, who won the series of four (the competition is held in 13 rounds of the Swiss system), secured the lead.
Given that Duda was the ranking champion, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood of him missing the break was very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to cut the lead to just 0.5 points, he remained the obvious favorite in the title fight.
Because to catch up with the leader, Antipov had to win in the 13th round.
But even that wouldn't help, win Duddy your party.
Plus, this win obligation could, of course, affect the Russian chess player's game and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He managed Francesco Rambaldi with confidence, then had to wait for Duda, who met Benjamin Bock, to finish his game.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player was able to win the match against the Dutchman.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored the same number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had better additional points.
That is why the leadership of the Khanty-Mansi autonomous region, whose governor Natalia Komarov traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded him the main prize.
But the girls' competition didn't have an intriguing ending.
The tournament's leader, Natalia Buks (Ukraine), was able to win the title without losing in the final round, which she did successfully.
So the victory of the Russian woman Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up to Bux.
The Russian athlete was second with 0.5 points behind the champion.
The Vampire is changing the regional structure.
The company combines the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - the region of the East.
The project will be completed by November 1.
As noted by the general director of Vimpelkom, Mikhail Slobodin, the changes are being made to "remain a strong player in the market", develop the company "in new, not always favorable external conditions".
In an interview with Russia 24 television, Mr. Slobodin clarified that they intend to reduce "ten percent" of staff in Russia.
The Rospotrebnadzor has inspected 78 Moscow Burger King restaurants and issued 367 orders.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volokolamsk Highway was fined 50 thousand rubles, and the establishment on the Great Tulsa Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after all violations were eliminated.
43 grocery stores violated the requirements for the premises.
Among other violations, the sanitary and technical and sanitary hygiene of the premises were unsatisfactory, the ventilation system was not complied with, and some of the bacteria of the intestinal rod were found in some establishments.
The Burger King franchise is owned by Burger Rus LLC, owner of the Chocolate Shop chain Alexander Kolobov, and operates 293 snack shops in Russia.
Igor Artemyev, head of the FAS, said the agency was against indexing 10% tariffs on freight transport and providing state subsidies, as requested by the RJD.
First they wanted 17 percent indexation, now they want 10 percent, and then they want billions of dollars in budget subsidies, he says.
We say, it's wrong, it's too much, cut your spending, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS had its own, "much stricter" proposals that are now being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net account with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of executing a put option on shares worth $300 million, the gold mining company said.
In this case, Polymetal would have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the price of the shares issued in favor of Sumeru and the market quotes) which could be taken from free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to either sell the option or claim a surcharge.
The details of the Polymetal negotiations are not disclosed.
The option was made as part of the purchase of Polymetal's "Red" project in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasichin, director of the Housing Policy Department of the Ministry of Construction, said that the ministry is working with the Central Bank on the process of sanitizing the developers.
"We understand that this is not possible, so we are developing a mechanism", the official said.
The Chernobyl screenplay for Citizen Kane is going up for auction.
Profiles in History auction house officials announced plans to auction out the black version of Citizen Kane, which is considered one of the best works by director, screenwriter and actor Orson Welles.
The auction will begin in Calabasas on September 29, with three black versions of the script, each worth $20-30 thousand, AP reports.
The first of the sketches, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevich, is the earliest script in private collections and is titled "American" - that's the working title of the film.
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, the third is the final plan of the film.
Ministry of Industry and Trade: direct food aid will not be the equivalent of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Yevtukhov said that the program of food assistance will not be an analogue of the card system of food distribution that existed in the USSR.
It is about modern targeted food assistance to the population and supporting an effective domestic product producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the wording "food card".
I would like to emphasize that the food stamps offered should not be confused with the past deficit record, a card distribution system where the quantity of food received is normalised.
We have proposed the concept so far, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation", Mr. Yevtukhov said.
Earlier, the Commerce Department said the program to introduce food stamps for the poor had been introduced into the government.

The president of Rosgosstraha wants to divorce his wife.
A source familiar with the situation told RAPSI that the president of the insurance company "Rosgosstrah" Daniel Khachaturov has filed a lawsuit against the Moscow court for divorce from designer Ulyana Sergiyenko.
The trial of the case will begin on September 16 at the 100th judicial district court.
Daniel Khachaturov asks to divorce his marriage and share the property.
The court confirmed the existence of a divorce claim in the proceedings, noting that the claim for property division had not been filed and will be considered in the district court.
The president of the Russian Railways, Alexander Bobresov, is leaving his post.
The vice president of the Russian Railways (RJD) corporate security Alexander Bobreshov is leaving the company, Interfax reports, citing a source.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Russian Railways Arkad Dvorkovich said that the issue of leaving the Russian Railways Alexander Bobreshov was initiated by the new head of the company Oleg Beloserov.
According to the deputy prime minister, the personnel changes in the management of the railway are not related to the change of the head of the company.
Earlier, the "Ъ" reported that instead of Vladimir Yakunin, the Russian Railways OAO was headed by the first deputy transport minister from St. Petersburg, Oleg Beloserov, who oversaw the financial block.
The new head of the company announced for the first time reforms in the monopoly: in a year and a half they will create a new system of freight tariffs.
Read more about the changes in the company in the "Community" article "Research of value".
This year, the Russian Manager Association's "Top 1000 Russian Managers" survey is published for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian high-level managers, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers over the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the laureates of last year's rankings.
Last year's winners are invited to confirm their participation as the current year's rating candidate and nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each candidate is asked to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, who would be useful to add to the overall pool of candidates.
The following executives of the company's functional areas may be appointed: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, human resources director, IT director, public and corporate relations director, public relations director, corporate governance director.
Each manager proposed by the experts is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate his management team and up to ten new executives from other companies.
The nomination of candidates is based on the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and forest processing, engineering, media business, metallurgy, multi-profile holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, service and consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is given a login and password to access the website www.top1000.amr.ru, where they can see information about the other participants and submit their assessments according to the criteria proposed for each functional direction.
The methodology behind the rating is the principle that "the best choose the best": top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle allows you to get the most authentic assessment of your colleagues' professional reputation.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of the expert committees.
All candidates for the current year's rating and multiple previous year's rating candidates are invited to the expert commissions' open meetings.
The Commission shall be organized by functional characteristics: the Commission for the approval of the list of senior leaders and eight Commissions for the approval of the heads of the functional directions.
At the meetings of the expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (the places are kept strictly according to the internet-evaluation and are closed information until the rating is published) or to make updated adjustments to them according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of "Ъ".
At the time of publication, the status of managers and companies may change.
The comfortable rate for an investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market for small and medium-sized businesses in January-April of this year has grown by 40%.
What do you think the situation is today?
After the panic of late 2014 and early 2015, the lending volume of SMEs has declined significantly.
The reason is obvious: a sharp increase in interest rates.
The 25-30% annual loan was not profitable to anyone.
If a bank could have raised all its possible future problems, from delays to no refunds, it's impossible now.
For businesses, the current rate of SME loans is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their return.
A rate of 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns.
How much do you think entrepreneurs' demand for loans is being met?
After the central bank lowered interest rates, things got a little better.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, we've seen that customers are looking for loans much less often.
First of all, the business does not understand its development prospects and future earnings.
Businesses today have one option: learn to work by focusing on the current economic situation in the country and region.
We need to monitor the current results more closely, monitor the movement of funds.
At the same time, if we have the financial resources, we should use new technologies to upgrade the equipment, reduce the costs of production and energy supply.
All of this ultimately allows companies to make their products more competitive and keep their business running even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the SME lending market that will strengthen and influence its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for the average rate cut will largely depend on the Central Bank's policy, and now the regulator is demonstrating consistency in the key rate cut.
However, a radical drop in lending prices for SMEs is not to be expected.
In the current situation, the problem is primarily inflation, which makes it necessary to raise interest rates to get real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even if the interest rates of the Central Bank are lowered.
Speaking of the default rate, traditionally small and medium-sized businesses that are limited in both cash flow and economic behavior adjustment options will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how the word Mazda is written in Japanese.
It's beautiful, concise, and at the same time quite difficult for those who are used to the Cyrillic or Latin.
The new CX-5 crossover, like any other model of the brand, is unpretentious on the outside, technically perfect on the inside.
Japanese is already able to bring the country's love of the products of the rising sun to a state of full admiration.
You can make as many arguments as you want in favor of cars from other countries, and you'll agree with them in principle, but the whole conversation will be broken by the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
There's no reason to argue!
Such people probably should love not only technology, but everything else Japanese.
To quote Basé's move, to make Wasabi food, to collect katana and to dress your girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but in the canons of street Japanese fashion: sweet, creative and very unexpected.
I think the Japanese school uniform is the only uniform that girls like to wear after school.
It has amazing qualities: both sensual and rigorous.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The major change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But even more so, the new design of the headlights and the rear lights changes the look of the car, making it instantly recognizable in the traffic.
As always, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensual, but the appearance is rigid.
You don't have to call the police.
Driving the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, is a static Japanese experience.
The 2.2 litre diesel engine provides high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this motor with a capacity of 175 liters per hour is only 5,9 liters. The power unit is equipped with an automatic transmission and a full drive.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
To add a little bit of black humor to this image, you can pick a legging with a print from the Not Cross police tape.
However, Mazda has made every effort to keep you from being in the scene of an accident while driving a CX-5.
To further enhance comfort while maintaining excellent control, the suspension has been redesigned to incorporate front and rear shock absorbers, and the shape of the front lower lever holes has been optimized.
The full-drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
High-speed road and engine noise is down 13%.
A flower bath or striped bath is as boring as a budget sedan.
It's a different story if a girl is chewing on a bathtub with an original drawing.
Like a computer game in the role-playing game genre.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design for both the front and rear seats, providing the optimal space for both wide shoulders and long legs - whoever has.
Even longer-legged people will appreciate that the centrifugal force in the front of the central tunnel is now soft and does not hit the ankles in the wheels.
The most extensive range of Mazda active safety systems is offered on the CX-5.
To identify a potential threat, radar, lasers and cameras are used.
There's adaptive lighting, and a lane drop warning, and dead zone monitoring, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunk trucks in the class.
The rear seats are folded in a 4:2:4 ratio - each section is equipped with a separate carrying lever - and the luggage compartment is increased to 1560 liters.
The costume of a cartoon hero in Japan is called "kyurumi".
It looks particularly good in the pyjamas.
It's all about the game!
Of course I can.
But also, entertain the little ones.
Or just walk around with a beast like that...
It's so great when you have the choice of cool clothes, behavior, or car.
Thank you for helping with the materials at Kawaicat.
Kiev has destroyed the nuclear union.
Kiev officially announced Ukraine's refusal to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant.
The Supreme Council on Wednesday, on its second attempt, voted to revoke the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements to complete the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but the project never got underway.
On Wednesday, the Ukrainian Supreme Council adopted a law that annulled the agreement with the Russian Federation in 2010-2012 on the construction of the third and fourth blocks at the Kmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The bill was passed by the government only after the second vote, the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with a minimum of 226, but then 234 members of parliament voted overwhelmingly for the bill.
The Kmelnytsky nuclear power plant, built under the USSR, was originally to have four power units of 1 GW with VWER reactors, but only two were built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the completion of the building led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, and the Council adopted the relevant laws in 2011-2012.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the building of the blocks would have to be on loan from the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling of relations between the two countries, Kiev began to curtail relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing its refusal to cooperate on the Kmelnitsky nuclear power plant and on the project of building a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where the relationship has been maintained is the purchase of fuel from Russia for the existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (which provided about half of the electricity production in the country), as the Ukrainian nuclear power company "Energoatom" will not replace Russian supplies with anything.
Plans to complete the Kmelnytsky nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: in 2014 in Kiev announced talks with the Czech Skoda JS.
UN Secretary-General against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that the situation in Syria cannot be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution", the AP quotes his answer to a question about Russia's military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also said he would hold a meeting with foreign ministers of the UN Security Council's permanent members on the situation in Syria.
I'll meet with the heads of the UN Security Council's permanent members later this month.
"The meeting will be on Syria", he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of creating an Air Force base in Syria in the future.
There are no plans yet.
"But anything can happen", Mr. Bogdanovsky said.
Earlier, the Commerce Department reported that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to official Damascus is necessary to fight the banned Islamic State terrorist group in Russia.
For more on the US's doubts about Russian aid to Syria, see the "Community" article "Russia's military presence in Syria is a concern for Washington".
The OSCE PA reports on a possible meeting of Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians.
Head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Arthur Gerasimov informed about the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentarians to discuss the situation in the southeast of Ukraine.
"What I know is that a meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations", Mr. Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and "return to normal life-activity in our countries".
Asked whether it is possible, in his opinion, to have a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at parliamentary level - in the "Norman format" or in the format of a contact group at the OSCE PA - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was held, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, in Kiev support all kinds of dialogue.
Earlier, Ukrainian representative at the talks, former president Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics have not yet changed their positions in the trilateral talks, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the election commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the municipal district's municipal election results, distributing 12 parliamentary mandates, divided by party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during elections have been made by representatives of the CPRF, who accused the election of "covering up for falsifications".
The opposition's comments were not accepted.
At one election, the Communists of Russia refused to hold a referendum on the abolition of the multi-apartment house repair fee.
The city election commission officially presented the results of the election to the city of Nizhny Novgorod by the municipal electoral district.
In total, 1,03 million people were included in the voter lists in Nizhny Novgorod, 746,7 thousand ballots were issued for voting in the district commissions, and 268 thousand voters voted in the elections.
More than 11,7 thousand ballots were declared invalid, and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed among political parties based on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia", six seats in the parliament are held by Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasterayev and Igor Nagorny.
The LDPR's only mandate was given by party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The two mandates of the Communist Party of Russia are divided between Vladimir Bulanov and the deputy of the State Duma Alexander Tarnaev.
Three mandates of "Justice Russia" are awarded to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will serve as deputies in the city duma. If the mandate is rejected, the candidate will be transferred to the next candidate on the party list.
The chairman of the municipal election Alexander Makeyev told the members of the commission that he was introducing duty for "sending telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" on the subject of refusing mandates.
When the election results were approved, the CPRF representatives reported multiple violations.
The member of the municipal elections committee with the right to consultative vote from the KPRF Leonid Krasnokutsky proposed not to recognize the results of voting in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that by order of the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district was closed the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located.
Neither the State Council members nor the candidates themselves nor the observers could enter the building for a long time, and the scandal was shown on television.
All observers and members of the commissions with the right to consultative vote were able to attend the meetings of the district commissions.
The head of the party stopped access to them only after the vote was over and the local commissions had not yet come to hand over their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"Then the head was corrected and all interested parties could attend the meetings", said Natalia Andryushina, a member of the municipal election committee.
The Communists objected to the illegal detention of the deputy of the regional assembly, Ludmila Aristova, in the blocked administration building for more than four hours, which was the subject of a statement to the Investigative Committee.
The opposition was also outraged that some UICs on election day began to seal the urns at 6-7 a.m. putting out ballots for early voting.
At the same time, the members of the advisory vote commissions and observers were not notified, so they arrived at the beginning of the election at 8 a.m.
Communists believe that in the morning hours before the election, ballots could be thrown uncontrollably into the urns.
However, the municipal election committee, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander Makeyev, found no violations with the threads of unrecorded ballots.
The members of the commission and their colleague from "Fair Russia" Maria Popova did not support the proposal to go through the polling station with amendments to the regional legislation to clearly set the time of opening the envelopes with early voting ballots, which then go to the urn.
"In your own initiative, please contact the CEC", Alexander Makeyev advised Mrs. Popova.
At the end of the meeting, the CPRF member Sergey Samohin was accused of ignoring dozens of complaints and covering up election fraud.
"You're not at a rally here, be more careful!" the chairman of the election commission said.
The protocol was approved almost unanimously.
By September 27, the electorate must approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the Lower Novgorod City Duma of the sixth convocation will be convened within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city's election commission refused to register the political party "Communists of Russia" as an initiative group for holding a local referendum.
According to the documents, the party was going to put two questions to the discussion of Nizhny Novgorod residents: do they agree that the charges for the repair of apartment buildings should be "immediately cancelled", and the tariffs on housing and communal services "freeze until 2020".
However, the lawyer of the Duma, Irina Maslova, explained that the appeal of the Russian Communists was contrary to the law.
FedEx's revenue is mixed, with a decline in forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported disappointing results in the last quarter, and the delivery giant cut its annual earnings forecast due to falling demand for freight services and rising costs in its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal holiday workers.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 part-time holiday workers.
Her stock fell about 2.5 percent in the preliminary auctions 45 minutes before the stock market opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents less than previously forecast.
Analysts estimated $10.84 according to FactSet.
The forecast is down despite the rate hike of an average of 4.9 percent, which will take effect on January 4, and the increase in tariffs for heavy or bulky cargoes on the ground, which begins in November.
The company said it still plans to grow revenue compared to last year due to lower spending, higher gross revenue and higher online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company "worked steadily in light of weak, projected, economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
Holiday hiring plans were announced the day after a competitor, UPS, announced that it planned to hire 95,000 more employees, about the same as last year.
For the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $2.42, close to the average forecast of $2.44 per share from a survey by Zacks Investment Research of 12 analysts.
Income increased 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated the total to be $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in the international express sector, which has led to a lack of growth in gross revenue in its express transportation division.
However, the boom in online shopping has dramatically improved the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from ground transportation grew by 29%, but operating revenues remained largely unchanged due to increased expenses for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express division received higher income due to higher base rates, while in the cargo sector the income fell due to higher labour costs.
At the initial public offering, about an hour before the stock market opened, FedEx stock fell $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, down 11 percent a year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve officials will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table of the Honduran redwood tree deciding whether it's time to raise key interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of a richly decorated two-story meeting room, a mural of the United States will hang above them.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The central bank has received a dual mandate from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, the Federal government has recognized that there is a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be an unknown factor in the almost predicted decision that will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to break free from the unprecedented stimulus provided by near-zero short-term interest rates since late 2008.
Even though most data shows a strong economic growth, recent upheavals in global financial markets may keep the already cautious Federal System from adding volatility by raising the federal funds rate by as little as a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important considerations", said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I think, however, that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the stakes, the increased uncertainty around the global market would be enough to give them a justification for waiting", she noted.
There's no consensus on what they're going to do with the Federal Reserve, which in itself is causing financial market fluctuations.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted interest rate growth this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to hold back, with the key indicator showing only about a 30 percent chance of a rapid rise.
It could lead to a stock market crash if the Federal Reserve raises the stakes, provided that the decision makers don't take the hit off by promising that the next raise will be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The launch was triggered by expectations that the Federal System's strategists would leave the stake this week, said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It would be a surprise if the Federal system raises rates at this point in time", he noted.
If the Fed does, "they'll have to go a long way in approving their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so they don't panic".
Other experts objected that raising the rate would calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal Reserve appears to have been inclined to raise the rate by 0.25 percent this month, taking the first small step in the slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected rates to rise this year despite complaints from the liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although the growth of new jobs in August slowed, the labor market growth was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and nearly at what the federal system calls full employment.
The wage increase is showing signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank's 2% annual target, the Federal Reserve said the temporary effect of a sharp drop in oil prices was the key cause.
The economy "can handle higher rates, and needs them, given the shrinking labor market", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake up at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 16% from a record high in May as investors feared the slowdown in the Chinese economy could slow global growth.
The market has partially recovered this month, and the Dow Jones Index is now about 10% below its high of May.
For the Federal Reserve, the market's outrage further complicates the difficult calculations of interest rate increases.
"Without information on what's happened in the financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would have started to get a little creepy at this meeting", said Steven D. Oliner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve official.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the consequences for the American economy might be, and they have almost no reliable data after the recent events in China", said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is not a central concern of the Federal System, and it should not be taken into account when making these decisions.
But essentially the Federal Reserve has become the global financial power.
The Central Bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
A single hint from then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could "mute" its monetary expansion caused a worldwide market upheaval.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, you would expect the Fed to not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "art rather than science", said Zachary Carabell, CEO of Envestnet Inc., a global wealth management company.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "there have been instances in the history of the Federal Reserve system of overreacting to financial market movements that do not seem to be related to economic principles".
Lacker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who insisted on raising the rate, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The Asian financial crisis has led the Federal System to lower its base rate by 0.75% in three sessions, "despite the limited identified consequences for growth in the U.S"., said Lacker.
A year later, the Federal government cancelled the reductions.
The Federal Reserve should only be concerned about stability in times of major crises, such as the 2008 market crash", said Adam C. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-fixing committee.
The last panic didn't come close to that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation where you're scared of rising rates because markets are shaking", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for the World Economy.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and no mention of financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should be ahead of the curve.
Do you need a good Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/deposit was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also trades for the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not in Tytown.
A market/store is a store where you can buy everything at once, offering a dizzying selection of fresh, frozen and dried foods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchenware, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There's even an auto department if you need to buy engine oil.
The store is huge, and it'll take more than an hour to sweep all the rows.
If shopping makes you hungry, buy food at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen department in the store (good and cheap) is near the box office and offers various options for carrying.
What's the suggestion: Do I need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
The prices are reasonable, and quite a few goods are sold in wholesale.
Fresh produce includes delicious Asian and local Thai herbs, fruits, and more.
The meat dishes are as diverse as the fish dishes - the staff at the dishes will clean and split the fish, and even fry it for you if you want.
A nice section of the store is dedicated to a large freezer, where you'll find frozen curry leaves, bitter pumpkin and galangles, whole duck, fish, beef and bile, pork sausage, icing, local sausage, semi-finished goods, and more.
Who's buying there: restaurant owners and chefs, as well as families and individual buyers.
There are also shop carts and forklifts in the wide passage.
Fresh durian mounting near the exit.
Location: The store is located in the industrial area of Los Angeles, adjacent to the edge of Chinatown and the city's business district, a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although there may be a lot of people in the store, parking is usually easy to find.
State Duma Speaker Sergei Narishkin admits that the United States is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees can flow into Europe.
As reported by Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulan Bator as part of the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a fan of conspiracy theories, but the question is: Is Europe not the ultimate goal of those who have been so maniacal in recent years to destabilize the situation in North Africa and the Middle East?" he asked.
"Someone must have anticipated and known that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who are escaping death, will be moving to prosperous EU countries", he added.
Narishkin asked: "Have many political leaders in Europe spoken out about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that is literally sweeping their countries?"
"No, the old Europe, with few exceptions, prefers to remain silent", he said.
According to Naryskin, NATO violates many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially watched and is watching as a NATO-style military boot, the moral ideals and basic principles and norms of international law are being dismantled", the speaker stressed.
The rebels, composed mostly of Islamists, are opposed to the government forces and their loyalist militant formations.
Later, the Islamic State terrorist group banned in Russia joined the Syrian government's opponents.
The United States supports the rebels who are opposing both Assad and ISIS.
Official Damascus considers such rebels terrorists.
The Syrian president has named the reason for the West's hostility to Russia.
The Western claims to countries like Syria, Russia and Iran are actually sovereign states.
This is the view expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and Russian Gazette.
Assad said the West does not accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and replace him with another who would act in the interests of Western countries, not his homeland, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of Western media with the start of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "has turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who represents the Russian opposition, who came to power in an undemocratic way, despite being elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West".
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the Western's constant claims that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves - it is at the demand of the people, not at the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president stays, otherwise he should leave immediately", he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded them that cooperation is being carried out with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism together with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking of Iran's military support, the Syrian leader noted that the country supports the Syrian state in politics, economy and military sphere.
He denied claims that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
"Of course, there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out", he explained.
As for the rest of the countries, we are open to cooperation with any of them if they have a serious desire to fight terrorism.
"We don't see this in the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Igilov coalition led by the United States", Assad said.
The death toll exceeded 230,000, while the number of refugees was 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was captured by the Islamic State terrorist group, which is banned in Russia.
The US-led international coalition is launching airstrikes on ISIS positions.
In Utah, 12 people died in the flood.
In the U.S. state of Utah, at least 12 people died as a result of flooding.
Another is missing, Fox 13 reports Salt Lake City.
Water washed out several cars and people in Washington County.
One of them, the family's van, stopped in a dangerous area near the water, and the stream suddenly overtook it.
The youngest victim was four years old.
All of the dead were residents of the Colorado City and Hilday areas that were hit by the storm.
Three children were also reported to have been rescued.
650 teams are involved in search and rescue operations.
The CSKA lost to Wolfsburg in the opening match of the Champions League: Football: Sport: Lenta.ru
Moscow's CSKA lost to the German "Wolfsburg" in the first round of the Champions League group tournament of the 2015/16 season.
The meeting ended with a score of 1:0.
Moscow CSKA started in the UEFA Champions League with a defeat.
The first half was more active.
In the 40th minute, German midfielder Julian Draxler was able to open the score.
In the second half of the meeting, the CSKA tried to attack more, but in the end both teams failed to distinguish themselves.
In a group B match, English side Manchester United lost to the Dutch side with a score of 1:2.
The winners were Hector Moreno and Luciano Narsing.
The guests have the only goal on Memphis Depay's account.
In the next game, which will be on September 30, the soldiers on their field will take the PSV.
Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
US Secretary of State John Kerry has had a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters, citing State Department spokesman John Kirby.
The topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide any further details.
He said the United States had the tools to "further isolate Russia" if it supports Syrian President Bashar Assad, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov during the conversation with Kerry again stressed the need to create a united front to fight against terrorist groups operating in the country.
The talks also discussed ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
In addition, some issues of a bilateral nature were addressed.
Earlier, U.S. officials said Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern over Moscow's increased support for Assad.
Washington said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be further isolated from the international community.
In response, Russian President Dmitry Peskov's spokesman said the country would not be put into international isolation.
The rebels are calling for the overthrow of Assad's regime.
Part of the territory was captured by the Islamic State terrorist organization.
The US-led international coalition is exposing ISIS positions to airstrikes.
Boroday called the American newspaper's information a slander on Strelkov.
Former Donetsk People's Republic's government chairman Alexander Boroday has denied the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the correspondent of "Lenty.ru".
The Washington Post's note is beautiful because it's all messed up.
Of course, no one linked former DPR defense minister Igor Strelkov and he "went" out of the territory of the Donbass republics in a very uplifted mood, without ropes, without three fur of money, which are attributed to him by different characters", he noted.
According to Bardoy, the conversation with an American newspaper reporter about the Strelkov was really going on.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov was urgently required to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic", - said the former head of the government of the DPR.
Boroday stressed that he did not know why a correspondent of the American edition decided to write about the fact that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia "bound".
I suspect this is provocation.
If it's not provocation, it's a surprisingly misunderstood word, because I emphasized that Strelkov was leaving alone", Boroday said.
"It's a slander on me and on Strelkov", he concluded.
Earlier, an article appeared in The Washington Post, which quoted a report by the Bearded as saying that he had forced Strelkov into Russian territory.
According to the publication, Boroday noted that he was forced to tie his partner.
The Polish authorities began searching for the Nazi gold train.
Polish loggers have begun cutting down trees over an underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, is a train with gold from the Third Reich.
The work began on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reports.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary to verify the accuracy of rumors about the railway's treasure trove.
Inside the train may be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesia Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence for the existence of the gold train was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, authorities have decided to secure the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland's deputy culture minister, Peter Zhukovsky, said that local treasure hunters had "99 percent chance" of finding the same train with the gold of the Third Reich that is mentioned in the legends.
Zhukovsky noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the jewels were found, they would become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures would not be handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm reported to the Polish city of Valbje to the authorities that they had found a train in a 70 meter deep tunnel.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
The chief narcologist of Russia proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Eugene Brun noted that before this age, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is particularly harmful".
He said this in a live broadcast of the Moscow Speaks radio station, commenting on the information that the spokesperson of the Soviet Union, Valentina Matviyenko, supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
Man matures unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, you're physically ready for it.
He's mentally ready for a full life in society since he's 21.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, does not mature until the age of 21", says Brune.
Earlier, the member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project "Trevering Russia" Sultan Hamzaev told Izvestia that Matviyenko supported the initiative to raise the age census for selling alcohol and "agreed with the Public Chamber to raise this issue again on the floor of the upper house of parliament".
According to the activist, a working group will soon be set up in the Federation Council to develop the bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the Children 's Information Protection Act
A resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor's office to check the Bible's compliance with the federal law "On protecting children from information that harms their health and development", and a Sib.fm correspondent read the statement on September 16.
The author of the petition stated that on August 26, 2015, he had purchased a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society in the Red Prospekt "Chitay-Gorgy" store.
He found fragments in the book that he thought violated the Federal Law on the Protection of Children from Information Harming Their Health and Development.
On 16 September, the application was accepted for consideration by the prosecutor's office of the city of Novosibirsk.
The answer to the appeal of the resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
It's not about banning a book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - commented the applicant to the correspondent Sib.fm.
And it's also a very fundamental problem that will make society panic.
He will start reading the Bible, which he has not done before.
Brazil's Rio Grande Paediatrics Union promotes healthy nutrition for breastfeeding mothers
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has devised a scandalous method to convince women that they need to be fully nourished while breastfeeding: the method involves showing images of infants breastfeeding, painted with images of harmful food.
Breast milk contains various proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which provide the nutrients needed to build a strong immune system.
Because of the high energy requirements, pregnant and newborn women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, recent research shows that a single calorie increase is not the only dietary change mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet by pregnant women actually influences gene expression in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative effects of unhealthy eating on the child's immune system have been found.
A train has hit a school bus near Hamburg.
A train near Hamburg crashed into a school bus that was stuck on the railway.
A 23-year-old female driver, realizing she couldn't move from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had a head-on collision.
It was taken on video by one of the students.
The school panicked because of the accident.
Some children started crying and running along the edges.
The route remains blocked.
According to police, no one was miraculously injured except one passenger on the train, who suffered minor injuries.
Damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country following the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a fight with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with Magali's victory by knockout in the 12th round.
Brown was hospitalized with a brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to a life support unit.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22, lost only two games and lost one fight.
He has two children left.
This is the second death among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Braydon Smith died from injuries sustained in the ring.
Now the AMA recommends not doing this sport, but rather, in her view, banning it altogether.
I understand this is happening unintentionally, said Stephen Parnis, vice president of the organization.
But in the current form of boxing, there will always be situations where an athlete gets a hemorrhage or a brain injury that results in either death or serious injury.
That's why the AMA believes we can't go on living with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body that brings together practising doctors and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
Russian State Duma Speaker Sergei Narishkin called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
He said this during his speech at the OSCE PA session in Ulan Bator.
We see this as unacceptable, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this must not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and ignorance of the principles of open international dialogue", the politician said.
In addition, Narishkin called on the OSCE PA participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's put morality back into politics.
Let's bring dialogue and law back into the practice of international communication.
Let's bring humanist ideals back to the democratic world order.
"Two never ended well", he said.
Speaking from the Parliamentary Assembly, the Russian State Duma Speaker called on parliamentarians to convene an interparliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to concentrate on the following specific security tasks.
"First, on the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convocation of our interparliamentary group", - said Narishkin.
He also noted that the OSCE should be respected.
"This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine", the politician stressed.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulan-Bator and will last until September 18.
I've been enjoying the win for a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergei Shubankov.
This season can be called a triumph for 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergei Shubenkov.
He managed to win the European team championship at his 110 meter hurdles, set several records, and most importantly, become world champion, becoming the first in the history of the national hurdles.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the "Diamond League", taking third place in the overall standings.
News asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the season.
Sergei, is the season not over for you?
Yeah, I'm gonna be at the World War Games in Korea in October, and then I'm gonna think about my vacation.
I'm gonna be home in Barnaul, but being home is a whole different state.
It's easier than wandering the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favorite time of year.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a beautiful time.
The passion for the big game has been rebooted, and the burden of responsibility has been lifted.
You can compete for pleasure, relaxation.
Plus, you know, the holidays are coming up.
Are you tired?
It's a special season, a lot of positive emotions.
Fatigue at the end of the season always builds up.
And it doesn't matter what you did most, win or lose.
Every competition is stressful.
Constant travel, moving, all of this doesn't go unnoticed by the body.
You're tired physically and emotionally.
But I'm feeling a little bit more emotionally right now.
I'm just happy!
Do you come back often to the moment you finished in the World Cup in Beijing?
It happens.
And you journalists don't let me forget that.
But I think the bad athlete is the one who lives on old victories, who's been running his successful races over and over again.
I've been enjoying a win for a couple of days, and we need to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can't say that there was anything special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter racing season.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at school, then back home.
It's just like usual.
But I set a goal with my coach: to try to take it to a new level that I've never been to.
Almost all winter time was spent laying the foundation.
We ran a bunch of sneakers, did a bunch of general fitness exercises that included pulling, and neighboring, and back-wheeling.
Then we took the barrier training, a lot of technical work.
Have you watched the competition?
I always try to do that, well, in the Internet age, there's no problem with that.
I watched the European Winter Championships, and the French took the whole pedestall in the barrier sprint!
I thought, we need to do something, dilute this company.
With every start this season, you've added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've had all the seasons of my life on roughly the same schedule.
There's no such thing as running 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always turn my shape upside down.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
The whole work was focused on that result.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready for a feat, and it's not always good to show your readiness in a competition.
How was it, like, at the London Olympics?
I, honestly, that semifinal race (Shubenkov couldn't get into the final. - "NI") tried to forget right away.
He was pretty good, really good at running out of 13 seconds.
Even if I repeated my best result at that point, I would have won the bronze medal at the Games.
But not luck.
Remember your first World Cup?
What's the matter?
It was in the tag.
I really wanted to get to the finals, there was this program.
And he fell right out of the morning in the preliminaries.
That's when I realized that to crack and carry a broken head is to run nowhere.
Two years later, at the World Championships in Moscow, he was in the final with a better time.
I remember my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the gold!
How do you manage to keep your head down, not to lose your head, not to shut off?
That's the hard part.
You have to be very careful, focused on the technique, so you don't break down the barriers.
He noticed that when you're not focused on the outcome, but on the process, it's much easier.
The funniest part is when you feel like you're running away and it's like it's going to happen!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our deep-sea athletes, after their first major success, are looking to move closer to the capital.
You never thought of that?
It's better at home anyway.
I don't know where I'd be without my coach who needs me.
Maybe it would be nice to have better conditions, but I try to be content with what I have.
Clevtsov, have you been together long?
12 years old, since I got into athletics.
I actually trained with his wife, who worked with the kids, and then she passed me on.
I started with the sprint, then I jumped in the long jump, triple.
Kids' lottery was when they throw a ball, jump in length from place to place...
I tried running the barrier at 14, and I liked it.
From the first race, the second adult class was able to comply.
It's what it is.
You've never been afraid of barriers?
I was able to reach an agreement with them.
But the technology has always been a lot of work.
He's been in a lot of pain over there.
But this routine is nowhere to be found.
The technique needs to be refined constantly so that at night I can be awakened and I would immediately get up and run across the barriers.
Everyone who saw your run in Beijing said it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you. Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually review my races, and I couldn't help myself.
But efficiency is something that needs to be worked on - there's no limit to perfection.
Are you not afraid that a year before the Olympics, a victory will be a heavy burden?
As they say in such cases, I'll try to live up to expectations.
If I've chosen this path, I must go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, you shouldn't feel any extra weight.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar of Kushnashvili
Well, I'm not naive enough to be surprised by the reaction to an interview that took place in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, don't feed them bread - let's throw the enemy.
And while I wasn't tired of the flag, and I was just, like, a million times talking here and not calling anybody a bastard, it was a different matter.
All my fake friends were gone in a second.
The pressure I'm under is so strong that even I, seeing the kind of guys, think white people are hugging.
You were walking, walking, and you were attacked by a mob and you were being pulled up with sticks.
But you should know me, I'm not a chamber eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a howitzer, I'm old, you guys, scared.
The other thing is no support.
I never had any illusions, and now...
I've always had the best self-sufficiency, so eat it.
And only assholes can give passports to freaks like Fred Derst or Monson.
I'd rather have a job as a journalist without shame.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili described the events in Crimea in a sharp way:
What they did to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I'm guessing the reference to the way the drunkard tried to sign something doesn't fit the general picture of the human dorm.
It's like coming to your neighbor's place and taking his place...
The war in the Kremlin is over, and it's only gonna end there.
I'm almost 100% sure, like the summer of 2008, it started with a call from some asshole from the Kremlin wall.
I have a hunch who it could be...
Cobbson doesn't have much to live on.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why would he have to lick Putin's hands?
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, they took down his monument.
Of course, people remembered him as an insult to his little homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise is seventh in the ranking despite the ninth to try to cover the losses of leaders on the Today Show
Carl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson's move to Canberra to cover the consequences of the Liberal Party's statement to release the leader did not raise the Today rating.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the state capital after Malcolm Turnbull defeated Tony Abbott.
The Sunrise competition, with David Koch and Samantha Armitage as hosts, is stuck in London as part of a week-long international broadcast series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This distance torture did not seem to have much meaning for Australian viewers, with Sunrise's audience at 397,000 in the five largest cities compared to Today's audience at 339,000.
Today scored a little more than its ratings on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been cutting back on Sunrise in recent months.
Today had 318,000 in August compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers in September, compared to 314,000 on Today.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are more powerful than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the tip.

The big news for Seven was the amazing debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thompson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move to New Zealand with his two children to the coast has garnered an impressive audience of 1.219 million.
Critics have been debating whether Thompson could handle the popular show alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night was a loud yes.
The X Factor Seventh remained in strong positions with an audience of 1,136 million viewers, easily surpassing The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
For the seventh, luck and failure were mixed on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new TV show, which was hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, drew 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 5:30 to 18:00) saw the number jump to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of Chase Australia drew 520,000 spectators, and the second half hour drew an overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat has raised $620,000.
The Chase Australia rating drop for the second night will force the Ninth to quietly admit that the Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.
It was originally published as "Sunrise leads, whereas Today remains locally".
The three finalists agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he pick?
The secret will be revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellows, Sarah McCay and Snowden Markosky may have accidentally figured out which one of them would win the Shroud.
The woman Sam Wood ends up with in The Nutcracker is shrouded in mystery.
And the three girls who made it to the final, of course, kept quiet about who got his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snow Markosky and Lana Jevons-Fellowes on the eve of the day when two of the three girls were due to be left, they may have inadvertently given a clue as to who would win.
Sam Wood is keeping quiet until the final on Thursday.
All three women come in a lyrical mood, explaining why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, purpose, family values, and joy as the reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
However, by answering the question, "If not you, who should get the last rose of the Buddha?" they could inadvertently tell which one of them had actually won the heart of the Carpenter.
Jevons-Fellowes and Markosky have no doubt called McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam have had a good relationship since day one.
"Since I joined the cast, I've felt the energy (of Sara) and the energy of Sam and I've realized they're very much in tune with each other, and I've been sure of that throughout the show", said Jevons-Fellowes.
"Sarah is a very open person, easy and fun to deal with", Markoski added.
I saw them together, there's a real attraction between them.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McCay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna be a great couple.
McKay herself said that from her home dates last week, she realized that Wood might be "the same person".
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it was definitely not just a game - I believed him with all my heart", she says.
When asked who Wood should choose, if it wasn't her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it", she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snow and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor is on Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jared Hane had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the United States - as were many other clubs who sent requests after an impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomswell, and it seems like a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of a ball that the former Australian rugby league player allowed on the first return of the pants in a game he won against Minnesota with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another chance to get the pant back, and also involved him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed himself on the good side after the game in the locker room.
Instead of giving the newcomers a break in front of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers special correspondent Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received support from special teams coordinator Thomas McGowan, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jared Haine lost the ball on the return of the pants by the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter.
This was not what Hayne and his numerous Australian fans had hoped for in their NHL debut.
He was seen wrestling as he left the field after losing the ball, and later he told the host of the show "Hamish and Andy" on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a more unfortunate start to his NFL career.
"It happens, you just think about the next game and everything", said Hein.
Heine compared his miss with his debut in the Origin series in 2007, when a throw in his counting zone brought an attempt to Queensland.
In the end, this experience proved to be very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Heine took a photo with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted the photo on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at a Siberian airport under threat of weapons.
Openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company "Yukos" was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were thwarted.
There were clashes between migrants and police on the Hungarian border.
The refugees organized protests at the border with Serbia near the Hungarian settlement of Reske, which escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water meters and tear gas, Reuters reports.
Migrants are throwing stones at police officers and trying to demolish the border fence.
The police are responding to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to violate the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reports the BBC.
The authorities of the country allowed the migrants to arrive in Croatia and ensure their transportation from there to the country they wanted.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian parliament tightened the legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the participation of the army in the security of state borders, criminal prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, and an accelerated procedure for processing asylum applications.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, and he will be deported and unable to return to Hungary for a year.
The Hungarian parliament also intends to consider the issue of transferring the functions of the Hungarian parliament to the Hungarian armed forces to guard the country's borders.
In late June, Hungarian authorities began building a 175 km long barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to stem the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
A Russian man has admitted to the biggest cyberattack in U.S. history.
Russian Vladimir Drinkman, accused of the largest cyberattack in U.S. history, has confessed to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, Reuters reports.
During a trial in federal court in New Jersey, Drinkman admitted to conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian told about the conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen, who are accused of cyberattacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the defendants' actions was estimated at $300 million.
"Those defendants like Vladimir Drinkman who have the skills to hack into our computer networks pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life, and national security", said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
The drinkman faces up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
When the verdict is handed down, the court will take into account the Russian's confession and may reduce his sentence.
Drinkman's sentencing is set for January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smiljanets, was arrested.
The latter has denied any wrongdoing he is charged with.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk of Russia supporting the Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our shared goal of fighting extremism, unless we focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power", the statement said.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the fight against the Islamic State group (which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
According to the secretary of state, Assad "will never be able to be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Kerry also stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
The White House has threatened to isolate Russia for supporting the Assad regime.
The day before, White House press secretary Joshua Ernest threatened to isolate Russia if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed joining an international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media has often reported the presence of Russian military personnel in Syria.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping Syrians learn the techniques to use against Islamists.
Four killed when police opened fire on protesters in Nepal with rubber bullets
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police began shooting rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the Ruppandaya district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country's capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the district police chief, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered at one of the police stations, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakala said the police used tear gas, then fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It's unclear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
The clash was the latest in weeks of fierce protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where representatives of the Madesi people say the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, among the citizens of the Tara people who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since 10 March.
In August, the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake in April that claimed thousands of lives.
Lawmakers voted on the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create a 900-employment facility.
Sajansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as a center for the chemical industry, and has a developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sajansk was led by a new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
He told the correspondent of "Oblastna" about the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects.
Oleg Valerievich, where did you start as mayor?
I first got acquainted with the results of the financial and economic activities, and initiated an independent audit of the spending of local budget.
Then the municipal property was audited.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the paperwork to five days.
Previously, court papers could go for months.
Measures to improve the income base and optimize expenditure were developed.
In November last year, a visiting government meeting was held in Sajansk, where the issues of social and economic development of the territory were considered.
There was no project-smete documentation (PSD) for any object in the city.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the road safety plan, the kindergarten, the northern sewer and the sewer.
The road work is already underway at two sites.
How is the order of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sajansk.
There hasn't been a positive demographic in the city in 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in kindergartens is one of the most pressing issues today.
Since 1 September, the 10th kindergarten, which is designed for 320 people, has been closed for a major renovation.
The estimated cost of the repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds before.
Last year, after the renovation, the 23rd kindergarten opened, which is now attended by 200 children.
The repair was done on the condition of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost amounted to more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds were sought for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the "People's Initiatives" program helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With it in place, we plan to eliminate the lineup of children between the ages of one and a half and three.
We don't have lines for children from three to seven.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction in the city should be done primarily by the Sayan enterprises, it is they who need to be employed.
Already in October, a 60-apartment orphanage is being put into operation in the Leningrad district.
As for construction, I would add that Sajansk is one of the four cities in Prangarya that is part of the economy-class housing program.
All the necessary documentation is ready.
Construction of 90 blocks will begin soon.
We have announced that we will build 10,000 square meters of housing for those who want to participate in the program.
One of the conditions is that the house should cost not more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this includes the "key" trim.
If we can handle the volume, we'll continue to participate in the program.
As for the investors, we have other interesting projects.
In its time, the area was home to the Sayan pig complex, which was sold in 2004 for a priceless price.
We're working with the DA to protest this deal.
Especially since the land under the property is federal property.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to the regional property, with subsequent transfer of land to the municipality is being resolved.
There is a potential investor willing to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the pig farm going, we'll have 900 jobs, which will be a big boost for the city.
Is there a social partnership institute in Sajansk?
We have about 140 social and economic partnership agreements.
Many projects have been realized thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
The company is supported by the ZJSC "Vostok-Center", the Novo-Ziminska TEP, the SYANSKI BROYLER, the SYANSKI BROYLER, the SYANSKI PK MDF, and the management of these enterprises responds to all requests.
Right before the Day of the City, the company "Sayan Broiler" gave the city a children's town, the firm "Vostok-Center" repaired the horse yard, where specialists are engaged in children's hypatherapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to the sponsorship funds, the territory of the city's ZAGS was improved.
The sponsors helped celebrate City Day in color.
As in the old days, a parade was held with the participation of city collectives and organizations.
The city's chronicle, a book of Sayan poets, was published.
The first-time builders and people who made a significant contribution to the development of Sajansk were awarded commemorative medals.
The patrons also participate in the city's charitable foundation.
The first step was to acquire instruments for young talented musicians.
Over the past nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles have been allocated to support talented children, children in need of expensive treatment, and children from poor families.
How are human resources problems solved in Sajansk?
There's a shortage of doctors and teachers in the city.
The provision of housing for specialists is of great importance in order to solve the human resources problem.
Last year, we allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers got official housing.
We have a housing program in place with the potential to privatize it in five years.
Plans are to redevelop the building, which will house eight more teachers' apartments.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the "Housing for Russian families" program.
In the future, building a home for budget workers.
Most importantly, I have a team in town that I can work with to solve the most difficult issues.
It's important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life doesn't stop.
The potential of Sajansk and our region is great.
The Duma has introduced a bill to index social pensions in view of the rise in prices.
The bill introduced into the State Duma provides for the indexation of social pensions annually from 1 February, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document - a deputy from "Justice Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsov - also proposes to conduct additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the pace of growth of the living wage exceeds the rate of growth of prices for goods and services.
According to the current legislation, social pensions are indexed annually from 1 April, taking into account the growth rate of the pensioner's living wage in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The bill introduced in the lower house provides for the introduction of social pension indexation taking into account the growth rates of consumer prices.
The first indexation is postponed to 1 February, and the second to 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA said that it was unacceptable to impose sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the EU's top representative for foreign affairs, Federica Mogherini, OSCE PA spokesman Ilka Kanerva stated that sanctions against lawmakers participating in the assembly's events were unacceptable.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulan-Bator, Nikolai Kovalev.
According to TASS, the European Parliamentary Assembly has gathered signatures from representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece and others to support Canerva's position.
"A strong enough support has already been formed", said Kovalev.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA had the intention of collecting the signatures of deputies, which indicated the inadmissibility of sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, noted Kovalev, Kanerva promised to raise the issue to the level of the EU's governing bodies and "send a corresponding petition".
NHC reports the likelihood of a cyclone south of Cape Verde is 60 percent.
The wide low-pressure region's front, about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Cape islands, has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure area about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles is also 60 percent likely to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reports Miami weather forecasters.
Google launches a campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced the launch of a campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping the overwhelmed refugees from war-torn and impoverished countries in Europe.
Google has used a non-personal approach to announce a fundraiser campaign on its blog.
Instead of a statement from one of the executives, Google employee Rita Masud, who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, described her personal experience.
"We were on suspicious trains and buses, suffering hunger, thirst, cold and fear", she wrote.
I'm very lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has escalated, many people like my family are in desperate need of help.
The donations will be distributed to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has announced that it will double the first $5.5 million donations until the amount on google.com/refugeerelief reaches $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, caused largely by the four-year civil war in Syria that displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

Obesity surgery can help diabetics with mild obesity
The positive effect of obesity surgery on people with mild obesity, type 2 diabetes, can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say that diabetics with mild obesity live longer after surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The statistics of mortality are not immediate", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery who wrote about the new study in a column for the editor of JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to digest food.
Bariatric surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes for several years, but the main studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
IMT, a measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal at a value of 18.5 to 24.9.
BMI 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your GMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass surgery and hand-held gastrectomy - with the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI for those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year of study participation.
At the same time, the BMI of those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains at about 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36 percent were completely cured of diabetes, and 28 percent were partially cured.
In the drug-treated group, for comparison, only 1% had a complete cure for diabetes and only about 2% had a partial cure.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "in general were better in the surgical group", the authors say.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hegemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin level of A1c dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
In the treatment group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But the better glycemic controls, reflected by the good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce mortality in five years, according to study leader Dr. Chi Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared with the group that completed a sleeve gastrectomy, the shunting group lost more weight (18.7 kg against 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% against 2.1%), and was also closer to complete remission of diabetes (46.9% against 16.7%).
While the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of surgical treatment in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from studies of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to increased life expectancy, reports Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study of obese people who had received bariatric surgery, the odds of dying over 15 years were about 29 percent lower than those who had more traditional procedures.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encourages people with BMI below 35 to be interested in such a procedure.
"The report is very important here because it claims that such surgery is safe in a group with low BMI, where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease", she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once a patient's BMI falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to get people to take it seriously", she said.
I think once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it's very difficult to reverse it.
In the Customs, robbers took out a pair of shorts and 9 million rubles.
In the Customs, robbers attacked the residents of a Moscow house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's suits.
This is reported by "Interfax" with reference to the press service of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs.
The incident happened Tuesday morning.
Two unknown persons entered the house through an open door, tied the 20-year-old son of the housekeeper and, threatening with both knives, stole 9 million rubles and three robes.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case was opened under the article "Rezba".
Europeans are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to watch the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are in no hurry to get a permit.
Experts say it's a very alarming sign.
In the run-up to the World Cup, the authorities will have to figure out how to move all the guests to the city.
Rosbalta's interlocutors believe that due to the tournament, the rental of rental apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship, the rental housing will have to be overpaid.
The World Cup has made the authorities pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for the first place, every hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it meets the declared number of stars and level of service.
It is now clear that not everyone can do this: hotel owners are so afraid of checks that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service in St. Petersburg.
According to the head of UFAS Vadim Vladimirov, the agency has studied 138 hotels and now plans to launch 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to anti-monopoly users.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived the citizens by placing a certain number of stars in the advertisement, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that literally every number on the account right now, you can't lose one before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will take over all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now tourists can count on 30,500 rooms.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, 550 one-star hotels.
According to the first deputy of the Committee for the Development of Tourism Nana Gwicia, only 23 hotels have been classified so far - so many checks have been carried out by accredited companies in St. Petersburg.
Whether any hotel has ordered this procedure from regional businesses is unknown to Smolny.
I mean, there might be more classification, but no one knows.
"The last six months hotels have not been very keen on classification", - said the director of the North-West branch of the Russian tourism industry union, Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season, when the hotel owners make the most money and don't want to do anything else.
Another reason is the budget, which did not include checks, and the procedure can cost the hotel from 30 to 100 thousand rubles or more depending on the status.
But in recent years, hotel managers have been actively working and have begun to apply for classification, Shadskaya said.
Hotels have to wait until July 1, 2016 or they'll not only pay the fine, but they won't even get the right to work at the world championship.
It is already known that depending on the star rating, a fixed fee for the hotel room will be developed during the tournament.
The formula for calculating the cost will be published next year.
This is done to prevent prices from rising by 200-300%, as is the case, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience and not allow a raise of two or three times, but you have to make money in hotels.
"I think the growth will be up to 50%", explained the president of the Russian Hotel Association, Gennady Lamshin.
Vladimir Vladimirov, in turn, is not sure whether price fixing is consistent with the understanding of market economy.
I don't know how much of this fits into economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"It's better than a steady increase in prices", he noted.
It's not clear what's going to happen to the popular cheap hostels.
State Duma deputies have introduced a bill that would ban hostels in residential homes.
We hope that this law will not be passed or will not affect St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved", says Nana Gvacia.
However, she said, owners of mini hotels should be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma approves the bill, about 80% of the hostels in St. Petersburg will be closed, and there are currently 1,5 thousand rooms.
According to the president of the Northwest Federation of Restaurants and Hotels, Leonid Garbar, St. Petersburg lacks two- and three-star hotels, which are in demand by football fans, but there is a gap in the direction of four- and five-star hotels.
This situation is similar to the situation when "75 thousand vipers sit in an 80,000-seat stadium".
This can be fixed with the mini-hotels.
The expert says that the possible ban is "idiotism": "I find it strange that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason, visitors can't".
If the hostel is used as a boarding house, I agree that's wrong.
But if it's like a hotel where guests come for a short time, why not?
The mini-hotels are at risk of missing the World Cup because of their lack of speed.
Hundreds of small hotels just don't make it through the ratings, and they're digging their own hole.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be ordering jobs.
"There are not many companies that can do this procedure, so they will refuse less-paid orders from mini hotels, and will choose those that are more expensive", - noted Gennady Lamshin, adding that in some cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the results of the checks are much higher than St. Petersburg.
The reason for the delay in St. Petersburg is also linked to the constant changes in the government's tourist block, which does not contribute to the harmonious work.
Experts say that if there are not enough St. Petersburg hotels, then the region's hotels and holiday homes will be the focus.
For example, the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg can be mobilized by the river fleet, which means that the guests of the tournament can live in their quarters.
In addition, many fans will arrive in vans ready to spend the night.
"The main thing is not to build so many hotels that they empty", says Gennady Lamshin.
Also very popular during the football championship will be the use of a rented accommodation.
Most likely, the city will have a reservation of rental apartments.
Rent rates will go up 10-30%.
"It's obvious that the first place to go is near the stadium", said Larisa Bragina, a real estate development and research agency rental specialist.
And the rent may not be back to the same level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
This will be facilitated by the construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
We must not forget the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar believes that St. Petersburg has always been a welcoming city, where people not only show a way, but also take a mini-excursion.
There are complications.
My father met a family from Murmansk in the 1970s in the courtyard - a father, mother and two children.
They found nowhere to stay: hotels were difficult at the time, and it was difficult to sleep at the train station.
"And Dad brought them to our condo to sleep", recalled the interviewer.
But he added that the city's population is no longer so bad. Calling home is a terrible thing.
But in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of the hotel and the governments, will we have to remember the past?
Zhirinsky "sliled" the Amur region.
I was so impressed with the clown Zhirinovsky in the State Duma.
He did things when our generation was just learning to trade newspapers, and he's still in great shape.
The theme of the speech is "LDPR protest against the election results in the Amur region".
The LDPR has no other protocols, except those signed by the elections.
And he's raising the runner-up Ivan Abramov and he's yelling something like, "This is the winner of the election!"
And then he rushes into Rodnin's head, and then, after a fight with the chairman, he drives the faction out of the meeting room, shouting literally "You're all on the front lines with your crooks and thieves".
The press, of course, is not focusing on Abramov, but on the scandal and the factional demarches that followed this scandal and insult.
Real Wolfowicz beautifully and elegantly fused the Amur region with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another outing of Zhirinovsky in the style of "Podonki!", and not a protest of the political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction has been formally scandalised, and the election, if you believe the party website and Ivan Abramov's Facebook, is not recognized, but the leader is obviously tearing down on the subject.
He allows the dead to bury their dead on Amur themselves, while he himself preaches against the "United Russia" in general and the innocent Rodny.
A smart decision not to lose face and not go into a real scandal.
Another thing is that Abramov himself is in a strange position.
He didn't expect anything except the screams from the chief, no protocols for alternatives.
He is not in the public eye, on the one hand, and on the other hand, for the narrow circle, he is the formal reason for insulting the respected champion, and, even more cool, the sham attacks against the European Union and the UNF.
And he's got to think about what he's going to do.
Because from the primary beneficiary of the election, the region's No. 2 politician and the No. 1 candidate for the only one-term regional district, he could turn into a bet that his own party leadership and the super-stimulator for the same UNF and the party leadership of another party have successfully used.
That's right. If there wasn't a Zhirinovsky, he should be invented and watched with respect.
Trump's still going to grow and grow.
The news is that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary.
I mean, the bathroom fell out of nowhere.
Only Abramov's theme was buried.
It's really beautiful.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the countries that are the homelands of refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched on the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama's Ethics Research Centre in Oxford, at the start of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He declared that under the circumstances the interests of mankind should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that while this is admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe", he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised the actions taken by Germany and Austria in response to the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"The care of thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries", he stressed.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems", he added.
Speaking of the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the US's harsh response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I wrote a letter of condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was possible through nonviolence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in children who have ingested hand sanitizer in the past four years
Toxicology centers in the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who have ingested a hand sanitizer with a high alcohol content, according to the Georgia State Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia State Toxicology Center, the number of children under 12 who swallow hand sanitizer fluids reported to the toxicology centers has increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are exposed to these substances more often, and unfortunately, a certain percentage of them are sent to the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant liquids on purpose, and some do so to impress their friends or to create a social media controversy.
You can see videos on YouTube of teenagers drinking disinfectant liquids as a cheap drink.
The teenagers reportedly mixed the disinfectant with an alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smell of disinfectant fluid.
"The child does not think it can harm him", Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand sanitizer) liquids are those that are flavored.
There are hand sanitizers that smell like strawberries, grapes, orange, which are very attractive for children.
Hand sanitizer contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, just a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's a high-concentration alcohol", said Fox 4 in Kansas City, D.C., Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief of the toxicology center at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn't leave a whisky just like that, but people keep these hand sanitizers in mind, and if kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a hand sanitizer with strawberry flavor in the amount of about four sprays at school, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an emergency physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija was confused and could not walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors were watching her all night in a separate children's clinic to avoid any signs of brain injury, as the girl fell and hit her head with alcohol, Ritchie said.
"It was very scary", said Orthoria Scott, Naija's mother.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-spirting substances or disinfectant wipes, in addition to removing hand sanitizers from the children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant liquids are linked to death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting a disinfectant containing a toxic unreported ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York conspired to poison their "opposite" teacher by "spreading antibacterial substances in the classroom", according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizers, and she forbids keeping them in her classroom.
Police believe the failed plan was "empty talk", and addresses discipline issues to the school district.
Like the oldest children's library in Barnaul, it's become a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the N.K. Krupskaya Regional Children's Library is a gray owl.
The kids who come to pick up the books try to feed her candy.
Several generations have been going to this library for 95 years.
The first readers in the twentieth century arranged loud chants, put on performances of Mayakovsky's poems, held literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and as the newspaper "Young Stalinist" wrote in 1939, with each passing day "the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupska and the friends of the children's library of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent a childhood photo to her distant friends in Barnaul.
And when the Barnaulians asked if she would mind if the library was named after her, she wrote that she did not.
Letters have long been in museums, and the grandchildren of first readers have to explain whose harsh profile the ballet on the library building adorned.
During the years of the rebuilding, people called me often, angry, asking why the children's library is not renamed.
Let's have a library named after some good children's writer, without political color!
The library staff sat down, thought about it, and decided to leave it as it was.
Krupskaya is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as is Leninka in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby is a yellow brick road.
"The Sorcerer of the Emerald City" is the favorite subject of the artist Olya Moskovka.
Olya used to be a manager at a law firm, she came to work at eight, left at five, and she was different from all the other managers except for her love of drawing.
And then I found an ad online, "We need a book illustrator".
It was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy".
Olia was illustrating, and she thought, life could end at any moment, and there would be no miracles in it unless you created them yourself.
She now works in the library, illustrates children's books by writers from around the world, and writes fairy tales herself.
It's been said that children are losing interest in books, that they're increasingly living in a virtual space...
But we have children who read, and their parents understand the importance of reading", says Tatyana Kushvid, director of the Russian Planet Library.
In recent years, we've even had a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed and will live on - children are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
A large display window with a new photo exhibition hangs in the library lobby.
Every quarter, new photos of readers are posted, who go to the library with their whole family: mom, dad, and kids.
The library is happy that fathers are coming with their children more and more often.
If a child is read all of Chukovsky at two years old, then at an older age he needs more difficult books.
But now there's a law that forbids an eight-year-old prodigy to give out books in the 12+ category.
To get a book like this, a child has to bring his parents with him - they come, they come back, and then "Krupska" gradually becomes a family club for them.
The library has a treasure - a pre-revolutionary collection of old stories with vintage and era, a story by Korolenko in the appendix to the magazine "Niva", a sewing of "Mursilki" for 1936.
After all, we are not just a conceptual space of a "temple of books", we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school", explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us, read, play, paint.
We made a playground for the kids - the kid comes to play, and the hand is still reaching for the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they're stuck on their feet, they don't want to leave.
Mothers often come in wheelchairs, and we're glad they put the library first among all the other places to go with babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says that today's children, like us, love classical children's literature:
"The publishing industry is evolving and there is a lot of attention being paid to authors who are the link between generations".
And speaking of little children, they need a hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library regularly publishes brochures for parents that tell parents what is happening in modern children's literature, which books should be read and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
Adults are not allowed to take books outside the reading room.
This magical privilege is only for children.
...in the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement, the bookstore.
The steps will be scratched under your feet, it's a very old time machine.
You're dating your childhood book like you're dating an old friend.
Ellie still has the same fun walking down a road paved with yellow bricks, the sloth of Tol Ryzhikov stealing magic matches, and the Boy-Kibalch never told the cursed bourgeois of the Military Secret - that's his strong word.
Books like this are like passwords, you can tell where you are from.
There are also real rare books in the library, like a pre-revolutionary collection of old ones with verses and eras.
Or tell Korolenko in the famous Niva magazine app.
Or the 1936 Murzilli stitch.
Time has aged the pages, painted them tea.
These publications are no longer being published to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, and I always dream of retiring and doing rare children's books.
But kids won't do it, so to speak: and the colors in old books aren't very bright, and the themes... you open the front page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now, I wonder why we were all writing this pioneering truth.
But it was interesting, says Galina Ilyasova, head of the bookstore.
The pages of Murzyly have been darkened over time.
Galina Vasilievna runs the bookstore all her life.
She knows what color the Buratino hat is, what school year Harry Potter captained the Griffinder team in the Quidditch Championship, what situations Carlson uses a motorcycle jammer, and who Alice Seleneva's father is working for.
Librarians are paid very little, and anyone who can live without these book ranges can find a new job very quickly.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, teachers, servants of the book cult.
They can also be recognized by the smile, which is considered the professional quality of a child librarian.
If he smiled at you the first minute of the conversation, he's a professional.
I like children's books in general: as a librarian, I like them to be, to be straight and beautiful on the shelves, and I also love to read them", says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: war, history, fairy tales, fiction.
I read modern Russian authors, recent translations...
Of course, I think my childhood was different.
Books were the most interesting and exciting thing that ever happened to me.
And because I loved them so much, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope books will always be there, despite the readers.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring their children and grandchildren...
Rumor mill: There are no differences in Celtic
Griffiths has denied any talk of disagreements at Celtic after Dale admitted that the Hoops were in a bad position, but he'll fix it.
The Hearts will be protesting the Scottish Football Association's claim against Nelson, and Warburton fears signing contracts in January could disrupt the team's unity.
The Dons have increased their lead to five points over Celtic.
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a slight lead over Hamilton at Pittodry, allowing the Dons to cut the Celtics by five points.
Griffiths denied the disagreements .
This sparked rumors of disagreements at Celtic, which were suppressed by Griffiths, who stated that he and his teammates were not suffering from any intensifying criticism as they prepared to meet with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling the tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in the title fight.
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands national team member Ronald de Burr has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as he is not competing for the title with Rangers.
De Burr, now a representative of Ajax, said: "The Celtics are no longer showing the most exciting moments in the Netherlands, so why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'm going to betray everything", Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was having trouble, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change things.
After the defeat of Malmö and, as a result, the exit from the Champions League, the loss of 10 players to Aberdeen was soon followed, which now, having been knocked out by five points, occupies the top line of the table.
However, Dale stated, "The Village has had bad times before, and we're going out again".
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need the support of the Celtics because that makes the players so much better.
It's so important to stay together right now.
Warburton is looking forward to January transfers .
Despite the opinions that emerged just a few weeks ago suggesting he had identified some of the goals of the January transfer, Rangers boss Mark Warburton has been skeptical of the January campaign, saying he does not want to destroy the team's unity.
The former Brentford striker said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window".
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season to adapt, which you've seen in our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Mitch, who's interested in Celtic, hinted at ending his career.
Swansea striker Mitch, who was linked with the Celtics during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his Swan contract expires.
The 29-year-old had been suffering from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Harts are going to fight the SFA over Nelson's claims.
The Hearts led by as much as 2:1 when they removed Patterson and started to lose 3:2, but the defensive red card was later revoked; this is Colum's third red card canceled in eight months.
Nelson doesn't back down, saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game".
Griffiths swore to avoid Tyncastle .
The sturdy Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with offensive words about former Hart's player Rudy Scatel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh Derby at the Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was hot", the striker said, adding, "I can say with confidence that I was not going back to Tyncastle if he wasn't playing for Celtic".
Donnelly: Tannadis' board is confident in the management of Dundee United.
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United board of directors is still confident that the management team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the guys ready to go out again", Donnelly said.
McKinnes is glad to see "beautiful" Hamilton win.
Derek McKinnes admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assizes to win their seventh consecutive league title, putting them five points above Celtic, at the top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty kick in the first half.
McInnes said, "There's no team here that won anything, a trophy or a league championship, that didn't win games like that".
The unemployment rate among Scots is unchanged, while in the United Kingdom it is rising overall.
UNWORKING in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the unemployment rate in the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, at 5.9%, was 5.5% higher than the UK, as indicated by figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people in three months, and the number of people working now stands at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, above the UK average of 73.5%.
Commenting on the latest figures, Scottish Minister of State David Mandell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for strengthening the economy".
It's been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the last 12 months, we have seen further improvement in the labour market in Scotland with employment rising and unemployment declining.
Why I'm a witness in Oklahoma.
Today, avoiding legal action at a later stage, I'll watch a man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the death row gallery at the Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The first time I asked was in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approached, I became afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell the detailed history of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and as the number of people who want to attend is often greater than the number of seats, the results of the dark lottery decide who gets elected.
In Oklahoma, press seats have been reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will watch it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'm gonna be sitting with Richard Glosipe's closest friends, and we've developed a personal relationship after months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I'm not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of being impartial.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes to, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have spoken better", but still felt that I was wrong about what I was doing.
Richard Glosipe disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it if he did.
I told him he could take me off his witness list anytime.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Belver, reporter at the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I recorded.
I'm not going to go into detail here again.
I can't say with any certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry van Trees' murder make him guilty of aiding and abetting a crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I'm pretty sure there wasn't enough evidence to convict him.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that angle, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can't say I'm entirely objective.
There will be other reporters to turn to.
You'll learn from me what it's like to watch a person I like die unnecessarily.
A man being chased by the police is persuaded to get out of the Canning River
The constable of Canning Vale managed to convince a man to get out of the Canning River and stay dry.
A Perth resident was determined to escape the police, but he was unable, being trapped in dirty water on a shallow water a few feet from a police officer who was "smoothly trying to persuade him to go ashore".
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for illegal entry into someone else's territory in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to escape by running into Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He was standing in the water and saying, 'I'm not going out, come on, catch me,' " said Senior Sergeant Chandell Castle.
Constable Laclane Perhavetz didn't really want to wet his uniform, so he used a safer method - "talking to a good cop".
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape", says Senior Sergeant Castledean.
That's what champion Ben Cazins remembered.
In 2006, Kazines moved to the qubt to avoid meeting a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to swim across the Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but he encouraged the locals to invent the humorous "Ben Kaczynski biathlon".
Peter Moody accuses the stewards of attempted espionage and threatens to leave horse racing
Peter Moody accused the racing Victoria stewards of trying to introduce a spy into his stable last year and threatened to leave the sport immediately.
His target was the stewards and ethics staff at Racing Victoria, whom he accused of running a campaign against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the start due to a violation of the rules of the drug on the start day, Wednesday, was the final straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always made every effort to participate in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to a positive result of the Lidar test on cobalt, which he cannot explain.
He kept his tongue shut about the suspicion of espionage for a year and a half and didn't want it to "look like a grapevine".
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been waiting a long time, but sometimes it gets you so upset that you can't help it", Modi said.
They know it's been going on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think it's not, then I'm gonna have to stop coaching.
Then I'll have to figure out what to do with my license.
Moody had previously sensationalized during an interview with racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I'd name if asked and offered him a job at my stable to share information about what I do at my stable", Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all file a complaint, no doubt, because they failed to catch me.
Robert Rolston, former RVL chairman, David Moody, current RVL chairman, and Bernard Sondry, RVL's current CEO, knew this all along and they know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's personal?
Shouldn't RVL have the courage to hold other people accountable for what's going on in this business besides the coaches?
Am I bad for this job?
Am I that bad for this job?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt what I'm saying right now might make them think about it.
But I've gotten to the point where I don't care, and it's saddening.
I'm really sad about this.
I'm going to put pressure on them and put them in charge of making decisions.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The coach's obsession only grew during a lengthy investigation into the cobalt and Lidari case, and the last horse to be pulled from the start made him say he could "throw his license on the table".
Moody, best known for preparing the undefeated Black Caviar champion, called the competition day medical drug requirements "ridiculous" after a clay compress was applied to the horse's legs, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules of running.
"I must take full responsibility for this", he declared.
One of my employees accidentally put a compress on her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could have got it yesterday, like it was.
She was with him the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months under the rules for medication on race day for using a compress, which is why the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's gone too far", Moody said.
A driver who made a hit and run in Cobram has been arrested.
Police arrested a man who hit a motorcycle in Cobram on the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of Natalia turned himself in to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has been blamed for using harsh force.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of his team's interception of the ball an "imposition of the agenda" by the two NRL championship favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to "fight" his team during the Storm's sudden victory in the final of the qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear clue to the Storm after his team won the qualifying tournament final against the Northern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game "typical" for rugby league and said that two of the Queensland team were not "too successful" in hand-to-hand combat.
Bellamy defended his team's interception and stated that they were simply focused on "contact", intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was inspired by the criticism of his team by two of the top coaches, as it meant they were concerned about a possible defeat by the Storm.
"It keeps popping up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about tough tackles when they beat us 24-2", Bell said Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or techniques for a year, just that in the last six weeks we've been paying special attention to intercepting the ball, and that's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there three years and he's obviously coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
Funny how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "impressive football", reminding his teacher that Bennett's St. George-Illover Dragons won the championship in 2010 by showing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our game on Friday night and see how impressive their game was", said Bellamy.
I remember in 2010, St. George got a lot of criticism about being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
It's the kind of football you want to play when you have players like that.
He made that remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football his style -- not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say those things, because they're a little bit worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game of "Storm" and "Rusters" was a competition with more points than the game of "Broncos" and "Cowboys".
The Broncos were probably good, I haven't seen them yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
Our game was 20:18, two more tries, and what, is that impressive football?
Or do you think that breaks and failed attempts are impressive?
It's routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we might meet them there.
The Storm are on a weekend weekend this week, as they have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the AAMI Park Preliminary, and tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb accused of drug possession released on $ 200 thousand bail
A man facing life in prison for attempting to smuggle 40kg of cocaine into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marco Maximovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on a Solay yacht that sailed from South America via Vanuatu and anchored in Kumer in August.
For the rest of the morning, Maximovich and his accomplices were seen at the dock, and later he met with them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kg of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Although Maximovich is facing life in prison for attempting to possess drugs in quantities sufficient to sell, Maximovich's lawyer claims that there is no evidence that the latter tried to get the whole batch, and that the man may have been in the cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich was worth bail.
The latter has ties to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often", he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal trial, he lied to the police about where he was.
Maximovich's mother and stepfather were offered a $200,000 bail for his release.
"It is clear from the testimony of both that the $200,000 pledge is too much of a financial burden for them", said Judge Flanagan.
But that measure alone is not enough to guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovich was allowed to bail on the condition that he hand over both his Australian and Serbian passport, be marked daily by the police and observe a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsikaris: "I'm proud of the Greek team, who fought until the last seconds".
Greece's head coach Fotis Katsikaris has paid tribute to his team after the quarter-final match of EuroBasket 2015 against Spain (71:73).
He said the game was solved by individual mistakes.
It was a big game", Kazikaris said.
We were preparing for a great Spanish play.
We tried to work it out in defense, but the mistakes in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my boys.
They fought until the last minute.
Joel Freeland: "I'm going to be assigned to the Kaun functions at CSKA".
CIA rookie Joel Freeland has said he doesn't believe in the curse of the military.
The Briton also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke to coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, "R-Sport quotes Friland as saying, "I will actually be tasked with the duties of Sasha Kaun, who left the team both in defensive build and in attack from the three-second zone, and I think I can handle that.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to get back to center position, though in the NBA, I was more of a forward.
Now we're gonna have to face a bigger center-leader, but I've done it before, so I think I can handle it now.
The last time the Army won the Euroleague was in 2008.
Since then, they've made it to the Final Four six times, but they've never been able to put on their best basketball.
There's a feeling someone's been smoothing the team.
This is a game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's difficult, I understand the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSKA.
As for the eyes, I'm not a superstitious person and I don't believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, and if you combine these two things, anything is possible.
I don't have any specific rituals before games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Louis Enrique: "For me, the game against Roma will be special".
Barcelona's head coach Luis Enrique has been keeping it a secret that he returned to Rome for the Champions League group stage match with Roma with special feelings.
According to the coach, the daily fight of his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique trained the Wolves in the 2011/12 season, but failed to show his best side in the Italian capital.
I returned to Rome after a few years, gaining some experience.
I have very warm memories of Rome.
It's going to be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start the Champions League with a win.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup won't affect the team's performance in the upcoming match.
I'm waiting for the Roma game she showed in the A-series against Juventus.
They're a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: Krasnodar has various options for attacking.
The acting head coach of "Ural" Vadim Skripchenko, ahead of the match of the 9th round of the premier league with "Krasnodar", noted the variety of attack schemes of the rival team.
According to the coach, the bulls have several models of attack in their arsenal.
The meeting will be held on September 21 and will begin at 16.30 Moscow time.
We'll see how we play with Krasnodar, "the official website of the Ural quotes Skripenko.
We've got a week of training ahead of us.
This team has a variety of offensive options, a variety of attacks, and we're a slow team, so I think it's going to be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that Krasnodar is hosting the Europa League match against Borussia Dortmund, we will try to prepare very well to win.
Rocher Kanyaas: "Astana House can take the glasses from anyone".
Astana's midfielder Roher Kanyaas expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future after the match of the Champions League group stage 1 with Benfica (0:2).
According to the Raubek, on their field, the Astonites are able to take points from any opponent.
Although the match was difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - quotes UEFA official website Kanjas. - We were a little bit lacking in courage in the attack.
Benfica are a little higher up, but in the home game, I think we can count on them taking points away.
It's very real.
But first, you have to think of Galatasaray, then Athletic.
In home games, we can take points from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "I'll say it again as many times as I want: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world".
Real Madrid's head coach Rafael Benitez expressed his satisfaction with a major victory in the Champions League group stage match against Shakhtar (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to the forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the author of three goals.
The match was not easy because Shakhtar is good at the ball, Benitez said.
The opponent didn't have many moments, but their counterattacks always hide the danger.
I'm not saying Real played perfectly, but we had plenty of chances.
I'm glad we didn't miss a ball and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
He's the best player in the world, I'll say it again and again.
Jordi Alba: "Christian Ronaldo is not like Messi".
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes that no one can compare to his fellow clubman Lionel Messi.
According to the Spaniard, Real's forward Cristiano Ronaldo can't do that either.
Messi is five points higher than the rest of the world, Le Figaro Albu quotes.
Not even Cristiano Ronaldo. He was a real hero.
Leo's on the field, and everything's different. I can't compare him to anyone.
Danielle De Rossi: Barcelona has not only a unique style, but also a bright personality.
Roma midfielder Danielle De Rossi, on the eve of the Champions League group match against Barcelona, noted the importance of compactness and underwriting in the game against such a strong opponent.
The meeting will be held tomorrow, beginning at 9.45 Moscow time.
We'll have a text broadcast.
"Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players", UEFA official website De Rossi quotes.
Blue-granate ones are difficult to play because they have not only unique style, but also distinctive personalities.
To leave them, we're gonna have to work our asses off and insure each other.
Messi is almost always successful when he goes down, so we need to keep things compact and organized.
Yezhov hopes to make the starting lineup of SKA in a match against "Slavon".
SKA goalkeeper Ilya Yezhov stressed that he hopes to be in the starting lineup of the army in the next match of the KHL championship.
Yezov came on the ice instead of Mikko Koskinen in the 23rd minute with a score of 0:3 and repulsed all the throws at his own goal, the fourth goal of the SKA missed after replacing the goalkeeper with a sixth field player.
The next match will be against Slovenia.
I hope to be out in the next match in the starting lineup, - quotes R-Sport from Yezhov.
I'm not a goalie expert, I'm a goalie myself, we don't have repeat missed goals, so it's hard to track.
Dynamo played well, everybody's got bad games.
The team still lost.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.

Steven Hogg used a girl's phone to get pedophiles to send photos.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to query images of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep, registered to the Internet messaging service, where he received a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the phone missing, and found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photos, and then immediately drew her mother's attention to it.
The police came and saw five images, then searched the computers found at this address, and found "corresponding" requests in the search engine using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he did it because it would "attract pedophiles", and then he would "pretend to be a cop to scare them".
Acting judge Elid Robertson told the sheriff's court in Dundee: "He said it was a habit, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted to making computer searches, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was questioned about talking to an unknown person who sent him pictures and asking for more pictures.
He said he was doing this to lure them in.
He said he had a headache when he drank, and he said he wanted to see images of rapes and murders.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl discovered the photos on her phone, she called her mother, trembling and crying.
She saw the dirty images on her phone, and then the defendant was placed on a blind date.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used a computer and a PlayStation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making indecent photographs of children on June 14 last year, violating bail terms on January 25 this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sim, has asked not to include Hogg in the list of persons who committed sexual offences, as it can be proven that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Allister Carmichael has postponed his sentence until October, until he receives a report from the social services.
Hogg was released on bail on this case, but was taken into custody before the other remaining cases could be heard.
He was listed as a sex offender before the date of sentencing.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is giving the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest head of state, fell down a staircase leading from the podium earlier this year.
He was unharmed, but the video of the crash was instantly posted on social media.
The opening of the parliament was also overshadowed by statements by parliamentary oppositionists that they had received anonymous threats warning them against whistling at Mugabe during the speech.
A month ago, they were criticizing the president during his address to the nation in parliament; this is exactly what Mugabe said on Tuesday.
Member of parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, Innosent Gonzalez, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The message came from a number that doesn't show, but it's titled 'Death,'" he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warned the high-ranking members that the inviolability ends in the parliament building, and once they leave, parliamentary inviolability does not apply.
The MP said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting to 30,000 jobs .
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and service spending reduction program.
That same year, Hewlett-Packard would split into two listed companies, separating computer and printer manufacturing from the more rapidly developing hardware and service operations sectors.
The allocation from the projected job cuts will be approximately US$2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, which will lead the organization after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard is currently, and the portfolio of business lines will be wider and deeper, helping the company move to a new business style", Whitman said.
As an individual company, we are better placed than ever to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and "will be focused on providing companies with complex technology solutions that were previously unattainable", the company said in a statement.
This is how a company was formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was dubbed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in the process of a major reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
HP, the world's second largest personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in the United States, is making this move a new development in the industry, based on the belief that highly specialized companies are doing better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arreta says his teammates should support injured Jack Wilshire before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
In a conversation with Wilshire, Wenger also stressed that it was only September, and that provided Wilshire's recovery went according to plan, nothing would prevent him from returning to the game by Christmas.
With the most favourable developments, Wilshire will miss at least four of his next games in England and, given what has happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The most offensive thing about this recent problem is that Wilshire finished the previous season with a single ankle injury and was about to return to his usual aggressive style of play during preseason training.
Wenger: "This injury is not a threat to his career".
It's just not a fully healed bone.
It's not serious.
It's just a coincidence.
It's not about his ankles or any injuries he's had before.
These may be medically related things, but as Wenger also admitted, there is an associated risk of additional injury for any player returning to the game mid-season.
There is also an adverse trend.
Premier Injuries Ltd reports Wilshire has 23 different injuries in the six years since his debut.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 games in the league over the past five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for Arsenal more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal were one of the two Premier League clubs to have missed the most days due to injuries.
Wenger admits he's likely to be stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe the improvement in injury statistics last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you get back on track from an injury, you're vulnerable for a while - you need to regain your strength and gain a competitive edge", said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope he recovers physically, and I'm sure that as well as his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal will begin the Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a match against Dynamo Zagreb and continue it on Saturday with games against Chelsea and the following Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the line-up.
Ector Bellerin and Aaron Ramzi did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Matie Debush and Arteta will be in the starting lineup.
Wenger may also be adding Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Morales and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep my balance and give a little rest to those players who need it", said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are the unquestionable favourites in Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo hasn't lost a single game in 41 since they managed to finish last season as the undefeated.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was hit by a magnitude 3.2 earthquake on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal have learned the lesson from last season's Champions League defeat to Monaco and are left with little hope of leading the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
"It's an incredible drive", Wenger said.
Arsenal have never done that before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
The lack of such stories is noticeable, especially considering how desperate men's need for openness has become, now more than ever, with the suicide rate among young men at its highest in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the single leading cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in the United Kingdom, and it happens three times more often than women.
In an effort to address the issue, the Campaign Against Unhappy Life declared 2015 the Year of Men to challenge a culture that denies men access to help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to take on this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students who had symptoms of depression found that if a patient had a sufficient number of friends who were "in a normal mood", the chances of healing doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a healthy circle of friends doubles the chance of developing mental disorders.
But, of course, for a friendship to work, it must first be.
In an age where communication is driven by social media, where style is preferred to content, the speed of response is often valued more than the content of contact.
Our digital lives double the need to appear strong, fun-loving, and successful, even when loneliness is real.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call outer values -- money, image, social status -- all at the expense of inner values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire video game developer recently observed, money can't buy more happiness.
The virtue of Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each character was defined not by his work, but rather by the personality that appeared in his interactions with friends.
JoJo and Chandler's constant hugs, moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross's sigh for Rachel - all comes from the realization that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As a Samaritan's employee told me, "...my role as a listener for people who experience depression and suicidal moods underscores how even the smallest amount of friendship can be beneficial".
Often, those men who come to us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old "live with it" lesson is as strong as the feeling that an open discussion of problems can be perceived as weakness".
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term overcoming mechanisms.
It highlighted the subtle moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of a stranger on the phone helps people in times of despair, while the long-term support comes from close family and friends.
So if you're going to the FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the decorations for the holiday have been completely restored, why not take your friends out for a drink at Central Perk.
Or even better, if you see a single person at Starbucks, smile and say "Hello".
You never know what friendship can do.
Friends is shown on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, under the tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal, helping PSG defeat Malmö
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Matyudi and Edison Kavani, celebrates the goals scored at Malmö.
Angel di Maria, making his debut in the Champions League, scored a goal, which allowed PSG to easily bypass Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the game response.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their part when Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League game with a very comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at Parc de Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after his first Champions League game as a PSG player began to set the direction for the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Donetsk Shakhtar in Group A, Paris had to make a good start in the game against the champions of Sweden, as they were not aiming for a playoff qualifier, but for a continuation of a series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They scored points, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later replace him on the field in a game against the team from his hometown and club, where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, to give your opponents problems and to play well in defence is a good start, even if there are still some things we need to work on during the season", Blanc said.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, although I regret we didn't score another goal or two.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the substitutions as part of the Paris team, which brought her a draw with 2:2 in a match against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but pushed him out of the backfield by Di Maria on the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker was noted as a player capable of taking PSG to a new level in Europe after he was bought out by Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he ran for a pass from Marco Verratti behind Malmö's defence and finished the attack beautifully by sending the ball past Johan Villand in the far corner of the gate.
However, if anyone expected a big and easy win from PSG, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, which beat Celtic in the playoffs to reach this stage, having nine world-class players on the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two supporting midfielders in the middle of the field, were a serious opponent.
But with the exception of Nicola Jurjic's hit, where the ball passed Kevin Trapp's long-range gate bar in the 34th minute, they attacked very little.
But "PSJ" sometimes failed itself with unresultant transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovich, who only in the first half could not implement at least five attempts, and then could not process the ball, which Kavani scored immediately after the game was resumed.
However, he proved himself much more adept at precise passing, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria received, sending the ball a twisted hit that went into the pitch past Viland in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after a clocking thanks to Kavanagh, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had straightened the ball sent to the center of the field from the left flank by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas Malmö had about returning to the game, and only Viland's interception of the ball from close range prevented David Lewis from increasing the final score before the replacement, Esquel LaVessi, was scored in the end of the match.
Malme coach Age Harride later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, while the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was last December".
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
The glory of Paris!
It was a great game with them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion on the sale of shares
The Swiss-based mining and trading giant Glencore, which has suffered from a drop in commodity prices, has earned $2.5 billion in stock sales as part of its massive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, has announced that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value, is struggling to cope with a plunge in raw material prices as China's economic downturn worsens demand and creates chaos in global markets.
With the release of new shares at a discounted price, Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange took off early on Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which was trading 0.69 percent higher when it opened.
Glencore last week began a $2.5 billion stock sale as part of a massive plan to reduce its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company was selling new shares at 125 cents a share, or a discount of 2.4 percent on the closing price on Tuesday.
It has placed 1.3 billion new shares, which is 9.99 percent of the company's share capital.
Fears of a further downturn in China's economy have led to iron ore prices falling by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House confirmed in an official statement on Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive on an official visit to the United States later this month.
This visit - Xi Jinping's first visit to Washington - will take place on September 25 and will be a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing in November last year, the statement said.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also welcome Xi Jinping and his wife, Pan Liu, to a government dinner later that evening after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, and will also allow the U.S. and Chinese presidents to approach the disputed issues constructively", the statement said.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with executives from several leading American technology companies on his way to Washington, and then travel to New York for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi Jinping are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns over alleged cyber espionage by China and China's growing categoricity on the disputed South China Sea.
The man who hit a biker on the Kutuzovsk lichach received 2 years of colony.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims against Denny Mirzoev for the amount of 1.2 million rubles.
The Moscow court in Dourгомилов has sentenced Denis Mirzoev, who killed a motorcyclist on Kutuzovsky Avenue in Moscow.
According to the Russian news service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years in prison in a settlement colony.
He was found guilty of violating the rules of road traffic and transportation of vehicles of the Russian Criminal Code.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims for the amount of 1.2 million rubles.
During the parties' discussions, the prosecutor asked to sentence Mirzoyev to three years in prison and recover the victims' claims in full amount - eight million rubles.
The accident, which is being discussed, occurred on May 22 at about three o'clock in the evening in the area of house 30 on Kutuzovsky Avenue.
The BMW, which Mirzoev was driving, crossed the opposite lane of traffic and hit a motorcyclist standing on the sidewalk.
A 1989 man died on the spot.
Friends of the deceased on social media reported that the BMW driver was driving at high speed and had left the intersection before the accident.
Fearing that the driver would try to escape, the bikers organized a motorcycle ride from the Vorobyyev Mountains to the Moscow State Department building at Petrovka, 38.
Soon after, it became known that the investigation had detained the alleged culprit in the crash.
A naked man was arrested in Moscow.
He was calm and uncompromising, and the police turned him over to a psychiatric emergency room.
Moscow police arrested a man who entered one of the temples without clothes.
This is reported by the Moscow Agency.
As the head of the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Andrey Galiakberov, told, the incident occurred on Tuesday, September 15, around 16.00 on the Kashir Highway.
A naked man entered the sanctuary of St. Nicholas.
He was calm and did not commit any illegal acts.
The police arrived at the scene on call.
Law enforcement waited for the doctors from the emergency psychiatric unit and handed over the man.
He was a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
More than 40 decrees and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 decrees and orders were signed by the governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev at the meeting of the regional government's presidium.
Part of them concerned the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, funds were allocated to purchase a bus for one of the schools of Nizhnetavda district, to repair the regional hospital in Kazan district.
As the accompanying documents say, the money will go towards completing the major renovation of the second floor of the therapeutic ward.
The hot and cold water supply, drainage, electricity and electrical equipment, ventilation systems, building facades, repair facilities, fire safety and energy conservation will be repaired.
The second forum of regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On 17-18 September, the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, where the delegation of the governor of Thuringia will take part.
About the upcoming event in Sochi and the intermediate results of the cooperation, the Honorable General Consul of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen Vladimir Shuгля, who joined the official delegation, tells.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the goals of the Sochi forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union state.
It is built on the fruitful cooperation of the regions, which are important links in relations between the two countries.
It is planned that the plenary meeting will be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.
In the framework of the plenary and sectional meetings, the speaker will talk about the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, about the regulatory and legal provision and the programs of the Union State.
The forum will be attended by the governor of the Tyumen region.
I think this is a sign of a successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend the forum.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including those from the Tyumen region, will be held.
I hope the forum will help us to conclude new, profitable contracts and agreements.
I would add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk in June last year.
More than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, participated in his work.
At the same time, a very important agreement on cooperation between the Tyumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The importance of our work is also reflected in the fact that a permanent seminar meeting of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen.
In addition, the delegation of the Tyumen region's agricultural cooperative visited the Republic of Belarus in order to study the experience of Belarusians in training personnel for agriculture, determine additional points of contact and organize new investment projects in the field of the agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the governor of Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev, the region's cooperation with the Republic of Belarus was discussed in the current difficult conditions.
The issue of supplying Belarusian agricultural equipment and using financial mechanisms will be raised - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the final consumer.
The problems in the work of the "Belshin" trading house in Thumen and the options for preventing losses were discussed.
The issues are important because investment projects must work clearly and bring benefits to the region.
It was discussed about further supply of passenger-loading equipment of MAZ, development of the service center of MAZ, which was established in Tyumen on the basis of TPATP.
The meeting also touched on the preparation of the region's working delegation's trip to the Republic of Belarus until the end of the current year.
Another topic of the conversation was the conclusion of the agreement and signing of the agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation of the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
So the dynamics of relationships promise to take it to a new level.
These issues were also relevant to the regional center.
During our meeting with the head of the city of Tyumen, Alexander Moore, we discussed the renovation of the Tyumen bus park.
About 100 buses are already "breathing for the ladder", so a new batch of cars from Belarus is required, which will run on gas, environmentally friendly fuel.
Another aspect: the Tyumen lift factory cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of lift products of the OJSC "Mogilevlyftmash", obtaining components.
I think this activity could be more active given the new elevator programs in the regional center.
I add that within the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting was held with Governor of Kurgan region Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing the trade turnover and supplying modern Belarusian equipment to the Trans-Ural region was discussed.
A meeting with the governor of Omsk is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five Russian subjects, but Tyumen can be called a kind of district headquarters.
The region is a hotbed for many promising projects, including the work of the Honorable Consul General.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good in that they allow for direct and quick resolution of many problems, reducing their acuteness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current circumstances, it is vital not to destroy the fence while continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people involved in filmmaking.
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that ethnicity was not necessary.
During the Sunday broadcast of the HBO show Project Greenlight, a well-known actor interrupted Brown as she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the lead black character in the script chosen for the project.
"Multiple is appropriate when you cast for the film itself, not the show", Damon insisted.
Braun, amazed, couldn't believe her ears, and was offended by the "Oh, no, no, no, no, no".
For the finalists, fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown.
"I want the participants - no matter who the director is - to think about what interpretation of the Harmony image they're going to stick to", Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who gets beaten up by a white slut.
Dear White People's producer advocated for the film's directors to be Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon was strongly opposed, saying that "we may not get what we want in the end".
After the discussion was shown on television, social media exploded with disappropriate comments about Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni angrily commented on the video: "The explanation of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black person in the room is SO WHITE, it hurts".
The tweet has garnered over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments come at a time when the media's ability to cover racial issues is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public debate.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by police in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, calling on lawmakers and government agencies to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned the movement during the nomination of the nominees for "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News executive Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group would be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter is a love group", said the movement's leaders.
It was recently announced that Damon was among the show business leaders, producers, and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation or met the Pope.
American Ninja Warrior is awarding first champion
Professional rock climber and waiter's assistant Isaac Calderot became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday night, taking home a $1 million prize.
At this sporting show, season 7, which has just ended, none of the participants have yet been able to pass all the obstacle course stages.
In the season finale, two contestants - Calderón and operator Jeff Britten - made it to the final round.
The final task involved a 75-foot rope lift in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the task and set the time, becoming the first athlete in the entire history of American Ninja Warrior to complete the grueling stage 4, but Calderón was able to complete the task three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After a win that came with incredible hard work, Calderón, shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview to E!News.
"It's amazing to think about it, because I've never earned or lived on more than $10,000 a year", Isaac told E! about his massive income jump.
And then suddenly... I never even imagined what it would be like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Wade met with reporters from The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, who was the first to cross the finish line, won't get any cash prizes.
The rules say the fastest participant gets the money.
"If there's more than one player in the final, the fastest player gets the prize", said Wade.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life-changing, it still brings great satisfaction.
I don't think he's offended by that.
He's happy with what he's done.
He got tons of rave reviews from fans.
He's a wonderful man and family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I'm going to lose to someone, I'm glad it's Isaac".
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we changed roles.
The show America Ninja Warrior will return with a seventh season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers are quietly bypassing the Minnesota Twins.
The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central Division.
Claiming to be a stumbling block, the Tigers brilliantly beat the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday, 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to cut their halftime lead to the Houston Astros and finish second in the playoffs in points after the winners.
For the Detroiters, even for one night, it was a return to the F word that missed most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they go", said Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon contributed to the offense, which resulted in Detroit scoring three points in the first two innings, then adding another in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and missed three innings.
It was only his third good start in nine outings.
"I just want to finish the year with good grades", Simon said.
The pitchers can't throw in every game, so I want to get deeper.
The designated Tiger's starting quarterback, Victor Martinez, hit three home runs and scored two runs - his first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first three-point play since the four-point play against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He was a good beat man", Osmus said.
He performed well in (better quality), was noticeably better at beat work and kept that quality for the game.
With three runs in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins earned their best chance of returning to the game.
Central receiver Byron Buxton opened the inning with a double on the left side of the field.
Wrightfield Aaron Hicks, batting first, and second baseman Brian Dozier got a strikeout on Simon's kickoff before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy outscored Moyer, the only player on the road, before newly appointed hitter Miguel Sano, who kicked a two-run single left of right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of out-of-the-out runners and a comparative injury on second base, Verhagen managed to get third baseman Trevor Pluff to bat in double play.
It was the 27th time for a major league player this season that Pluff kicked a double-double.
After Detroit added a premiership injury in the first half of the ninth inning, Moore earned an RBI "double" into the outfield space against closing Tiger pitcher Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-hander knocked Sano out after three strikes and got his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of temporarily untrained Phil Hughes early in the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against a deserving pitcher who was on the injured list before the game, missing more than a month due to a thigh inflammation.
"It's definitely not the start I wanted", Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots in the third inning".
After the first batter reached first base, Hughes threw the single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out wake by right-hander J.D. Martinez knocked out Victor Martinez, who made the single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series 0 for 21 with the runners in a positive position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single, causing another injury, but Victor Martinez was beaten in an attempt to get close to third base, thus eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the score in the second inning, taking a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center fielder Anthony Goose, and the score was 3-0.
"It was a big hit", said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he hit the right spot.
Hughes, who was credited with throwing, threw in the scoreless third inning, after which he was replaced by right-handed relief pitcher A.J. Achter.
Hughes was three for six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
WARNING: Tigers right-handed pitcher Aníbal Sánchez has been released due to a right shoulder sprain.
He's being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who had Sanchez's shoulder surgery back in 2007.
Sanchez, who's been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to be out on Wednesday.
In Sanchez' absence, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and go up against the Twins.
Norris, who has been out of the Tigers in four starts since being acquired in exchange for left-handed pitcher David Price on July 30, has 1 win and 1 loss.
He hasn't played since August 20 because of a hair muscle strain.
The Tigers and Twins will finish the three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) right-handed pitcher Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73) will play.
The original complaint of Kadyrov on the book "Molba do Boga" was filed in the South Sahal court.
The original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov to the South Sahal City Court has been filed against the decision to recognize the book "Prayer to God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam" as "extremist material", reports "Interfax" with reference to the chairman of the state judiciary Alexander Chuhraya.
Now the court is waiting for possible objections from the parties to the trial.
Chukhrai declined to comment on the statements of some deputies of the Russian State Duma about the need to check the case for possible cooperation with foreign special services and ISIS.
"Let them make such nonsense themselves", he said.
On September 11, the South Sakhalin City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognize the book as "extremist material".
The appeal came from the South Sakhalinsk prosecutor's office on Friday night.
The prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to recognize only the author's opinion as extremist, not verses from the Quran.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge made the wrong decision", Chuhrai said.
The decision to recognize the book as "extremist material" was made on August 12, 2015.
In particular, quotes from the Qur'an were called "extremist" - "To You we worship and to You we ask for help", "So do not call upon anyone besides Allah".
Kadyrov called the book's decision makers "devils and provocateurs".
He urged the deputies of the State Duma to prohibit judicial decisions concerning the texts of the holy writings.
"I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should pass a law that prohibits judicial decisions directly concerning the texts of the Quran and other Divine Scriptures", Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram.
Facebook will delete comments that insult migrants and refugees
Facebook officials intend to remove posts and comments that give negative reviews of migrants and refugees.
The social network will also provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
To combat xenophobia and racism on the Internet, the Facebook leadership is working with the German Justice Ministry.
The head of the department, Haiko Maas, said that the ministry is currently working with social media experts to create a special group of moderators.
It is the responsibility of its members to monitor and remove any incorrect comments about migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for their deletion.
Organizations that collect complaints about offensive posts from users of social networks should also help to block illegal content.
Facebook's management is willing to provide the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts that contained negative comments against migrants and refugees, the social networking board and the German Justice Ministry, was taken after xenophobic sentiment in the German Facebook segment rose sharply.
One of the most obvious reasons for this was the unprecedented migration crisis that swept across the European Union some time ago.
So, in Germany, there are already overcrowded places for refugees.
The day before, the authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced migrants from the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks that held prisoners and prisoners of war under the Nazi regime.
There will be relaxation areas at Moscow cemeteries.
In the near future, several of the capital's cemeteries will be equipped with specialized zones for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first is the Butov, Domodedov and Sherbin cemeteries.
The first psychological recreation zone has already been established at the Troekurov cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar sites will be established in other parts of the city.
About this portal m24.ru told Artem Yekimov, who is the head of the State budget institution "Ritual".
The relaxation areas will be small green areas resembling parks.
According to experts, in such "corners" visitors to the cemetery can rest, be alone and regain their psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in Domodedovo, Butovo and Sherbin cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the Ritual Graduate School, if the cemetery grounds need to be expanded, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest landscape as much as possible.
The greenhouses will serve as a living fence that will divide the recreation areas and the areas directly under burial sites.
The experts of the "Ritual" DBU also announced their intention to propose a refusal of the gardening at the burials.
New cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, the "Ritual" DBU has announced that it is ready to install electronic terminals, which will allow visitors to the cemetery to know GPS coordinates and number signs of burials.
In June of this year, the Ritual Graduate School also proposed adjusting the cost of the funeral services depending on the time of year.
So, digging a grave in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the land is frozen.
It should be noted that in the past year, the prices of all types of ritual services have increased by an average of 10 percent.
In the forest of Elnin, five days later, they found a missing fungus.
The old man was found alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the woods without provisions.
The humpback mountain was discovered thanks to the combined efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old retired Tambovsky spent five days in the forest".
No food or water.
He was wanted by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even dog movie theaters, but no results.
The man was located after a helicopter was connected to the search.
That day, Vitaly Alexandrovich as usual went to the forest for the bridges and the bridges, but did not return by evening.
The relatives immediately called for help, and the next day rescuers and indifferent residents from the neighboring village - only about 30 people - were called in to search for the fungus.
On the fifth day, a helicopter from the fire and rescue center joined them.
Andrei Seletskov, head of the search and rescue team of the Smolensk region fire and rescue center, said: "The helicopter was pulled, the man was found".
He's gone a long way, somewhere else.
It was about 12 kilometers from the search.
He's come a long way at his age.
Miraculously, he survived.
The mushroom was taken to the central district hospital in Eln, unconscious, in a very serious condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and body overcooling.
How an elderly man survived five days in the woods is beyond the reach of doctors.
Valentina Nepscha, head of the therapeutic department of the central hospital in Helsinki: "The patient is being examined, the treatment is being done".
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
The pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich comes to Smolensk every year from the Tambov region.
His grandson says that his grandfather used to go to pick mushrooms, but never went deep into the forest.
Alexey Spitchenko, the grandson of the found mushroom, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, he is not a local in principle".
He's been visiting his relatives for years.
Well, I went to get mushrooms.
I guess he went a long way and got lost.
With the beginning of the fungal season, people are regularly lost in all areas of Smolensk region.
Five such incidents in the last few days alone.
Rescuers remind us to walk in the woods in bright clothes, with little food, matches and a compass.
It is also desirable to leave traces behind so that you can return.
An-2 crashed into a broadside.
Right on the sewer, an An-2 crash landed in Siberia.
The plane of the Krasnoyarsk-based airline "Yenis" made an emergency landing 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no fatalities or injuries, but the plane itself suffered significant damage during the landing.
An-2 was on a service flight.
Three crew members were on board - a commander, a second pilot and a flight mechanic, reports "Interfax".
The aircraft made a flight along the route of Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsky - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The plane's already delivered to Bratsk.
The Brotherhood Transportation Prosecutor's Office has begun a check on compliance with the safety legislation after the crash landing of the An-2.
The investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor's Office has arrived at the scene.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed their passenger plane due to a technical malfunction at an abandoned taege airfield in Komi.
The engine and onboard electronics were turned down, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was hurt in the emergency landing.
News of Economy ― Nobel laureate: globalization
The processes of globalization were to help reduce inequality in the world.
The reality is different, the income gap in the developing economies is growing.
Eric Muskin. What is it?
To correct this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to Eric Maskin, chief scientist of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision Selection at the HSE Research Institute, winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics.
The world has experienced an unprecedented growth in global markets over the past twenty years.
Trade borders between countries were becoming more open.
Globalists predicted big benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have largely come true", Maskin emphasizes.
For example, China and India have seen a significant increase in GDP per capita.
But not all is so bright.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the "rich" and the "poor" in poor countries, which is reflected in the large income inequality, or rather, wage inequality.
But in reality, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why Global Markets Have Not Reduced Inequality in Emerging Economies", published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by the World Bank Research Institute.
Together with economist and Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, Eric Musk developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income disparities in poor countries are increasing as globalization increases, says the HSE Research Institute.
There are specific processes going on in the new global market.
To demonstrate this, Musk has allocated four levels of expertise - A and B for rich countries, C and D for poor countries.
After globalization, D's from poor countries lack the skills to work with A's and B's from rich countries.
And if the salaries of C-level workers in poor countries are increasing because of cooperation with B-level workers in rich countries, then D-level workers are not experiencing growth or their salaries are falling at all.
The result is that internationalization of production will contribute to increasing the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thus to increasing inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin have proposed a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It helps explain why globalization has led to income inequality", says Fouad Aleskerov, a professor emeritus, head of the International Laboratory of Analysis and Decision-Making, head of the mathematics department at the HSE Research Institute.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge in empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the scientist notes that the workers themselves do not have the resources to do so, and it is not profitable for companies to pay for their training.
Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations can play a significant role in such a situation, Musk said.
The scientist notes that the theory developed by him does not call for the cessation of the process of globalization, which has brought and is bearing fruit in the form of a country's GDP growth.
A living connection of the times.
Derbent - one of the oldest cities in Russia - is celebrating its 2000th anniversary in September.
The festival features a festival of national cultures of the people of Dagestan and a fair in the style of the past, an exhibition of derbent carpets and the Day of Open Temples, a historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed Peter I Museum.
The medieval stones of the Narin-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all of this seems to have come from the pages of "One Thousand and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has remained in place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Khazar Caganate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern planks, which grow in the courtyard of the Juma mosque in Derbent, is several centuries.
These powerful plants are protected by the All-Russian program "Trees - Monuments of Living Nature".
The shadow of the scattered crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
Visitors to the mosque will be served aromatic tea and daughters will be served with Daughtry delicacies - honey fig, hurma, mushroom, miracle cakes, irons and sweets.
In Derbent, for centuries, large samovarers have been used to drink tea to numerous guests at once.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 AH.
That's 733 on the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is spectacular in size and solemnity: the arched domes and vaults are supported by square columns and illuminated by sunlight from tiny windows.
The keeping and breeding of pigeons is a traditional pastime of the people of Derbent.
Pets keep pigeons in their backyards, under trees, in their attics.
The spectacle is the flight of a herd of white doves, similar to the flashes of a festive fireworks display.
To defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians covered the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
500 metres into the sea, this structure locked the harbor of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets in Derbent were woven as early as the fifth century, and the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged to this day.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for every taste - all-color and all-color wool, cotton or wool slats, with or without wax, with elaborate ornaments and a quaint style.
The city was built from mounds - one-story stone buildings.
The magals have hardly changed over the years.
Only the satellite dishes, the air conditioners on the walls and the street lamps remind you that you are not in a medieval city, but in a modern one.
The old part of the city retains parts of a waterway built by the Persians about a thousand years ago.
To our day, there are ancient springs from which the local people still draw water.
Many Derbent people prefer regular tap water to water from verified historical fountains.
Derbent was the center of pottery.
Water and paint vases, dishes, pots, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
Potters are still making fine ceramic items for practical and souvenir use.
During the holidays and festivals, the crowd gathers under a tightrope, where the students of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of this amazing and risky skill goes back several centuries.
A new trend is that there are more and more girls among the rope runners.
The former Girl Bath is now home to the Museum of Ancient Derbent's Culture and Life.
Unmarried girls and brides used to bathe here with their friends, but now anyone can see the vaulted-domed hall, hot and cold swimming pools, which have been used for bathing.
Most of the houses in Durban have hot water, but bathrooms and steam rooms are as popular today as they were in the old days.
The benefits of steam warming the body are written in ancient books.
After a bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, the body gains flexibility and ease.
The festival "Sodruzija", which takes place on the territory of the Narin-Kala fortress, is attended by ethnic minorities from many areas of Dagestan.
The participants in national costumes dance, play folk tunes, perform songs of the Caucasus peoples and treat visitors to delicious homemade cheese.
Kirkhlyar is the burial place of forty martyrs who laid their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
The yellow sarcophagus, which has been around since ancient times, is carved out of solid stone blocks and oriented, as is common among the Arabs, along the west-east axis.
The Gavril brothers and Albert Jacobs shave and shave clients in a small salon near Upper Market.
The barber shop has been here for years.
The reception of the curry craft is passed down from generation to generation.
And the Jacobs can do not only traditional hairstyles, but also the most modern.
On one of the streets of the Old Town, the house in which the writer-decembrist Alexander Bestujev-Marlinsky, who was exiled to the Caucasus, lived is preserved.
Having learned the Turkish language and collected ethnographic material, he described the Derbent of the first third of the 19th century with its ancient monuments, the life and livelihoods of the townspeople.
The teahouse is a traditional Eastern club serving only tea and homemade baked goods.
Men come here to quench their thirst, talk to their friends, and solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not recommended to go over the teahouse threshold.
The Darbensian dance ensemble "Caspius" was founded three years ago, but has already taken part in events at the republican and Russian levels.
The ensemble's soloists rehearse every day, perfecting the folk Avar, Dargin, Tat, Armenian dances.
As the evening approaches, when the noise is gone and street lights are lit, the locals sit on the counter near the terraced houses.
Usually, the scumbags discuss household issues.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they are increasingly recalling episodes of their city's unique history that influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
There was a business game at the airport in Domodedovo.
The capital is experiencing a new form of education.
Four hundred students tried their hand at the airport.
For this, the Domodedov has three airports.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also serviced planes.
It was all a business game, but it was not too difficult to make.
Late flights, two passengers with fractures on board, traps lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
Hell for the real airport.
For the one who settled in Domodedov's hangar, it's a standard set of tasks that newbies have to solve.
One hangar housed three major airports from around the world.
Today, they employ four hundred students from the capital's colleges and universities.
An unprecedented opportunity to learn all about the inner world of the airfield.
They were entrusted with the registration of passengers, the servicing of aircraft, the handling of luggage - even buses on the flight deck, tracks and inspection of passengers.
And the passengers are all problematic.
One had a paperwork problem, another was late for his flight, and the third filled his bag with suspicious items.
And you have to deal with it like you do in life, in the shortest possible time.
For each of these tasks, they're charged a certain amount, virtual money, as if the airline had paid them the corresponding amount for the flight service.
"For failure to perform the relevant tasks, they are fined", explains the game's financial analyst Dmitry Hilko in an interview with Vesti-Moscow.
The Ministry of Education is closely monitoring the situation.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of learning.
She's already been offered a place in her high school.
"Six interregional competence centers will be formed, which will be, in fact, new models of modern colleges with modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment", - says Director of the Department of State Policy in the field of training of working cadres and additional professional education of the Ministry of Science of Russia Natalia Zolotareva.
But for students, it's not up to global plans.
After three days of training, they're gonna need a break.
But the grades for this exam were quite material.
The newest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding to our complaint on Instagram on time", said the game's participant, the team's manager Sergei Shuvalov.
The best judges, as they are called, are hired on a pencil to be hired by the time they finish their studies.
The U.S. Embassy regrets closing the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia has expressed regret over the closure of the American Center for Foreign Literature.
The center has been operating in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American Center of the U.S. Embassy at the All-Russian State Library named after M.I.Rudomino in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by Russia in recent times call into question the commitment of the Russian government to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been broken even during the Cold War and other difficult moments of our long history", said US Ambassador John Teft in a statement to Interfax.
The American Center has created deep and strong ties between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a meeting place for numerous prominent American figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians, and writers.
"Last year alone, the American Center hosted more than 400 cultural and educational events and welcomed more than 50,000 Russian visitors", the diplomat said.
Teft recalled that about a year ago, the decision was made to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program) educational exchange program.
The Green Tribunal was quick to execute.
Typical situation: Four officials stand before the judge's table, listening to his complaints about the work done.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We did not give you a 110-page order to make fun of him, says Kumar.
If there's one more brick, we'll order the demolition of all existing buildings.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial body established in 2010 to halt the rapid environmental pollution that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has handled more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two out of three cases, the court decides to stop the construction of the building, which leads to pollution.
The odds are incredibly high: In less than 60 years since the declaration of independence, India has grown from a jungle-filled country to one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large cities, where infrastructure development is not in line with rapid urbanization: cities are covered in dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from businesses and households, and the few remaining residential areas are being cut down for construction by new residential neighborhoods.
Despite formal support for the green movement from the state, the NZT is regularly criticized by Narendra Modi's government as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May, the environment minister called the court's decisions "extreme" and "impossible".
Sometimes it is impossible to execute a court decision within the time limit set by the court, environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani confirms.
However, unfulfilled deadlines have a positive side: At least they make the responsible person move.
"His main goal is to shake this system up", adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly canceled major construction projects: the construction of airports, power stations and hundreds of smaller structures.
People are also being reminded of this, for example, when discussing the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telangana state that contaminated the local river with fluoride.
We can shut down your factory, but we're also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs", Kumar said.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can be changed by a single handwritten pen.
In April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, sparking public outrage.
Despite the sharp decline in popularity and the scandal of critics, Swatander Kumar refused to reverse the decision.
Instead, he ordered the Delhi government to provide statistics on incoming and outgoing buses, and offered to buy 10,000 additional buses, asking the factories whether they could fulfill such an order.
As the court's attention was drawn to pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality, and even road accidents, the public anger began to subside.
But the most sickening issue of the magistrate was the Ganges River cleanup program, with the pump announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a river sacred to Hindus, the judge often stops his emotions and starts screaming.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
"Someone poured water from the Ganges on the statue of God, and it was fecal", the judge said.
You keep polluting the river because you think Gang is Gang, it will take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and look what you do with it every day.
Ganga cleanup is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.
The current fecal bacteria in this river is more than 120 times the normal.
Every year, 1.5 to 3 out of 700 million Hindus who bathe in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Gang Rescue Fund the money he made from selling his suit, which he used to meet with Barack Obama, and 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of being popular: the suit was bought for $700,000, while the river needs at least $8 billion to clean up.
Green Tribunal supporters agree that India has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but do not believe that progress should be at the cost of ecology.
"In a developing country, environmental talk is often perceived as an unacceptable luxury", says Call of the Gang activist Malik Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a golden middle ground between ecology and development".
A man spilled blood on several of Dali's paintings at the Riga exhibition.
A visitor to the Latvian Union of Artists exhibition in Riga broke the museum's windows and damaged the sculpture of Salvador Dali's "The Appearance of an Angel".
The museum is currently hosting an exhibition of Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
The 1985 man entered the sculpture hall at 14:20 hours.
He immediately drove in inappropriately: he ruined the sculpture, smashed the windows.
He then began to move around the premises and stained several works of permanent exhibition with blood.
Among them is a portrait of the Brush Hand of Myervaldis Polis.
According to Igor Dobychin, president of the Latvian Union of Artists, to whom "Interfax" refers, the windows were also damaged.
Police and art experts are working on the scene.
The latter determine the extent of damage and damage.
A criminal case has been filed against the man.
The Latvian Union of Artists holds a Picasso and Dali exhibition from August 4 to September 27, which presents more than 200 original works by artists.
Commentator Gennady Orlov is hospitalized in Spain.
On Wednesday, the Russian champion "Zenit" from St. Petersburg will play his first Champions League group stage match against the Spanish "Valencia".
Unfortunately, the St. Petersburg game is not commented on by Gennady Orlov.
NTV commentator Gennady Orlov was hospitalized Wednesday at one of the Spanish clinics with suspicion of acute appendicitis.
The survey will give the answer - whether seventy-year-old Gennady Sergeyevich needs surgical treatment.
The match will be commented by Konstantin Genich.
The Zenit are in the Champions League group.
His rivals are the Spanish Valencia, the French Lyon and the Belgian Ghent.

Xi Jinping calls for a more open economy for the world
The economy must become more open to the world to boost its growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday in a speech to a group facing the challenge of reform leadership.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop an openness policy", he said, addressing the participants of the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group on Comprehensive Reform Enhancement.
He said that expanding openness and deepening reforms will give the economy new momentum and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The leading group adopted a number of directives, including regulating investors' access to the market, changing border control rules, encouraging state enterprises (SOE) to attract private capital and revising the residents' registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually repaired through test programs.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a more significant role in resource allocation, business legality and increased openness, as stated in the statement.
The government will also weaken control over the powers it gives companies, thus ensuring that companies run their own businesses.
The statement also said China would allow border regions to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to boost local growth.
More sectors will be available to private investors to increase transparency in state-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better conditions", the statement said.
The procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or a green card, will be further facilitated by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report released after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yunshang and Zhang Gaoli were also present.
