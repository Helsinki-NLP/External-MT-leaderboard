In an emergency call, the professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend
During a call to the emergency line with a shaking voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and was required to come home to them.
Lamb decided that his "sweet dog" was the house alive and probably upset, and that contacts to the family of the dead woman could be found on her phone.
Inside the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on a white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," it was stated in the letter, which according to authorities signed Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to the school campus where police believe he shot his beloved professor Ethan Schmidt in the door of his office.
Police chief at Delta State University, Lynn Buford, said university staff heard gunfire at 10:18 a.m.
Lambly made a fateful call to the emergency line shortly thereafter.
Eventually another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
A day after a school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities are still trying to figure out what Lamb’s motivation was.
The details released by state investigators and students and staff who knew him jointly created the image of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or a violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote, thanking the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both of them taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other faculty members, and many students attended classes at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations regarding problems.
The student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaken, “as if something was wrong with him.”
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously applied for leave from Delta State University for medical reasons, saying he had a problem.
And this year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate on which Lamb worked hard would not guarantee him an automatic term to become an assistant professor.
William LaForge, president of the university, said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamba apparently bothered something."
Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After he left the campus, police captured his footprint as he crossed the Arkansas border back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single shot from a gun in the yard of a house about a mile away from his parents in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington state coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
The car started on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb began working at a university that has 3,500 students in a city that counts about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and lessons of education.
He obtained a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamba’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20, when they met through common friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older boy who taught her guitar for several years.
He was quite a heartbreaker at the time.
The hearts of all the girls were shrinking as soon as he appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40 and lives in the suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentissly walked together for some time.
During an emergency call, Lamb said, “I killed my wife,” but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the Gautier River.
Police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they separated 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
“She was completely broken down,” O’Steen said of her daughter.
She was my mother’s best friend.
O'Steen said he hadn't met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he knew Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when they performed with Abigail at a summer festival three years ago.
They later played random gigs together.
O’Steen said his daughter is writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a brightly illuminated bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamba and Prentiss on the night of September 5th, after Lamb played a guitar and harmonic for an innumerable crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
“They were just a happy couple,” he said.
We talked and joked with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the murdered professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in Native American and Colonial History, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the Boy Student Club and Student Government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people including faculty members, staff, students and community members attended a candlestick commemorative event.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The school started again on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get our students back,” LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this reporting.
This story was modified to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a call to the emergency line after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us claims they won’t hire as many seasonal workers as they did last year, but the toy and product manufacturer claims it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will start recruiting candidates this month, and it will recruit employees during October until December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire staff to help in stores and sales, for shipping and delivering goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his date with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also important for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would sit there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The movie begins and it happens to me that I am on the verge of something that could be called a fake date with a princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about "Back to the Future," which features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: "It's indeed for me undoubtedly the best travel documentary ever filmed."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
United Nations says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s accelerated military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the almost five-year conflict and more weapons will only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and promote inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent councils - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the ministerial session of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that divisions within the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers “have made this situation insoluble.”
Ban called on the five permanent members to show their solidarity and unity in reaching the Iran nuclear deal to resolve the crisis in Syria.
8 Election Numbers That Show Donald Trump in Real Light
Some have tried to describe him as a person who often changes opinions.
Others waved over their hands like an unsuccessful joke.
And some are preparing for implantation.
But regardless of whether some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they don’t (yet) succeed.
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead by a two-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously wonder what this means for this real estate magnate’s nomination odds.
This is only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
Nothing of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry’s leadership made the way to the rise of Herman Cain, eventually none of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are a lot of reasons why he might come to the general election.
But external groups like Jeba Bush’s Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Club for Growth are aware of Trump’s will to endure and are beginning to unload their dollars to overthrow him.
Here are some recent voting figures that suggest that a real estate magnate is not just a transient phase:
Trump’s favorability rating has turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University vote showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnate.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Three out of ten people say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers hold in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac University poll last week found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be “indignant” with his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be “enthusiastic” versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next Next post: Enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “disappointed” or “disrupted” if Jeb Bush’s business favorite became a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bullshit and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are inclined to the idea that the real estate magnate has the right temperament for the post of president, according to a Monday vote by ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held in the Iowa State Senate Club, which is the first in the country where 52 percent of Republicans think they have a commander’s personality, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
Still, 44 percent think they don’t have a personality to serve effectively, and 6 out of 10 independent respondents say his temperament doesn’t belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are accustomed to this idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
Asked who was most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is a change from late July, when four out of 10 bet their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
At the same time in the previous cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the nomination against 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitte Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as credible.
Even though Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some scholars emphasize that the fragmented field probably contributes to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University survey from early September shows that in a hypothetical direct confrontation between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gains majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marc Ruby with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He is in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would lead over the dealer with a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
A large majority of Donald Trump supporters say they have already made their own opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters backing Trump say they won’t change their minds anymore.
Obviously, this can change a lot of things, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46% say they keep the back door open for a change between candidates.
Still, Trump’s current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “violent” in his campaign announcement speech, immigration has remained the main and central topic of the 2016 conversation.
Some fear that Trump’s nausea is diverting key Hispanic voters from the Republican party and harming rebranding efforts.
But according to a new Monday poll by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the issue of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
The frustration of the government is reaching new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today get roughly half of the support from Republican voters, mainly given their status of outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in Monday’s new ABC/Post vote say they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also very angry at Washington.
A vote by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are “unhappy” and 21 percent are “hellily angry.”
The parliament supported a greater share of the state's coal taxes.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million euros.
The House of Representatives in the first reading supported the government amendment of the upper law, which regulates the amount of the income tax from the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised the MPs that thanks to this they will get extra money from both the state treasury and the municipal budgets.
The proposal was criticized by opposition lawmakers, who fear that mining firms will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House in first reading supported the government's amendment to the upper law, which, among other things, means that the state should receive a greater part of the income from surface coal mining fees from mining companies.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The proposal also changes the method of calculating the payment for the minerals that companies extract.
The change in mining fees is expected to bring to the state treasury 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
The government has a neutral impact on municipal budget revenues, as the fee is expected to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns from fees and 150 million crowns from the state budget.
From the mining of brown coal, the municipalities spent about 200 million kronor and the state 66 million.
The new law also envisages an increase in the allowance for extracting land to 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments will continue to belong in full to the municipalities.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the MPs that municipalities will receive annually, instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its decree.
The reimbursement shall be newly calculated as a combination of the amount of extracted mineral and the rate for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
But ODS member Marek Benda warned that the establishment of the fee by a government decree may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to the Minister, however, this is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral, which is the state property.
Only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining receive fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the money will be given to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same is true of radioactive mining.
Part of the money collected by the state on mining fees will be targeted.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The proposal was criticized by opposition deputies, wholy claimed that it would damage the communities affected by the mining and the counties.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining firms will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to make the Minister of Finance improve the budget," said David Kádner (Usvit) elected in Ústecký kraj.
From the rise of unemployment in Mostecko warned MP Hana Aulická.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the novel, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The reasoning report says that according to the mining companies, the increase in taxes will not affect coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent long-term negotiated.
Major consumers such as power plants or heat plants should therefore not feel the price rise.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, he believes that the increase in taxes is acceptable.
According to Milan Urban (ČSSD), the rapporteur on the novel, it is crucial that the MPs know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and especially the government’s decision on coal mining limits before the bill is approved.
If coal is extracted beyond the limits, it will have an impact on the revenue for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit on the mining of the Czechoslovak army should fall only after 2020.
The limits on the ČSA mine should be broken for social, national and economic reasons, as well as for the long-term stability of domestic energy.
It will lead the Czechs as a number one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the table at Thursday's draw of the Davis Cup in India, and this time each of them will probably hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to distribute the load on the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
In Delhi, the heat and humidity are high, so challenging matches can last up to five sets are expected.
We must take this into account.
I would like to distribute it according to the weather.
And according to how it will look, Navrátil said at today's training of the Czech national team in the center of Raj Kumara Khan.
With the team's number one and the world's fourtieth Jiřím Veselým, he counts to Friday and Sunday two games.
In the second place are probably Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek.
I would like almost everyone to participate.
I’ve got a little bit of it in my head, but I’m not going to say it yet, the captain said.
Another assurance in the Czech composition should be Štěpánkova's participation in Saturday's four-game.
The only question is who will stand next to the experienced debutant who has a 18-4 balance in the Davis Cup in four games.
Probably not fun.
There are options with Rosol or Adam Pavlásk.
"I really don't know with whom and how it will look," he said.
It will be decided according to the development of the two games.
The variant can be Pavlásek, with Veselý surprised in the first round with a win in the deble over the Australians.
“He’s very decent,” he said returning.
I played against Australia, and if I play, I would like to show the same performance that I showed in the second set.
“I am pleased with the experience and would like to bring a point,” Pavlásek said.
The home team will place Yuki Bhambri (125. in the ATP ranking), who won the challenger last week in Shanghai, where he defeated the third and fourth hundred players.
The second will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
Both of them are challenger players and our players have experience with the ATP Tour, but many times we have been convinced that the Davis Cup rankings are not decisive.
“It’s the current form, the weather,” he said.
The opening two games will begin at 6:30 p.m. and may be delayed due to the weather.
According to the forecast, it will rain and the court is not under the roof.
It can be used with artificial lighting.
They have already burned it and it has some two thousand lux, which is enough.
“It should be played under the lights,” he said Returned.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut at PMQ has been highly anticipated.
New job leader Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut in Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time he will have to collaborate with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will ask the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and MPs.
In a weekly statement, he called for "less theatre and more facts."
He also said he could skip several sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby’s leadership, which comes after his appointment to the Shadow Cabinet and his Tuesday speech at the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to remain silent during the singing of the national anthem in service on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has met criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of several stories on the headlines of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention.
Mr. Corbyn's spokesman said he would "stand in respectful silence" and that he would recognize "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the battle for Britain."
However, Mr. Corbyn’s shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, told BBC Two’s Newsnight that he would recommend Labour leader sing the national anthem “no matter” his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences in economy, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says political differences in work are also "changing" after Mr. Corbyn's appointment despite his position in the European Union and the government's benefit limit.
Mr. Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Labour Party had submitted amended proposals to remove the entire idea of the benefit limit.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, secretary of shadow work and pensions, stated that the party “very clearly” opposed the government’s plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced in the last decade since he was elected Conservative leader.
The leader of the Labour Party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims to have ideas “from the crowd” on questions for Mr. Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQs are too confrontational and that they will refrain from both “fast response” and tooth trade, and instead promise to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at the PMQ when he does not attend — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also refrained from the idea of allowing other colleagues to speak for him from time to time because he was told he had discussed the matter with House spokesman John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to deviate from the style of politics "Punch and Judy," which was often associated with the PMQ, but a few years later admitted he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been seen as a key barometer of leaders’ judgment, their House leadership, and their attitude among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become a cartoon and need far-reaching reforms.
"Fotography in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to homeless.
But one group of former street children found a way to learn something and make a living.
“I was photographed in Joburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

Libra jumped the following data and showed a recovery in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was driven up by SABMiller bid target.
Between May and June, GB profits including bonuses rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009 and it seemed to be approaching estimates when rates would rise.
The sterling rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped by 20% after receiving an approximation offer from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and bring brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch closer together.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.

JD Sports CEO says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports Executive Chairman Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that purchasing power would outweigh higher wage costs in his company, he said.
The cost could hit JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
The opponents of the Prague apartment house marshmeloun cheer.
The controversial building was stopped.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested against the construction, which is to arise in the immediate vicinity of the Anežskiy monastery in the center of Prague, before the Prague office, a petition was created.
The Magistrate in the decision stated that there was a breach of the construction law because all the requirements of the territorial decision were not observed.
"The territorial decision in question does not contain certain details, such as the type of land, the distance from neighboring buildings, the shape of the building described clearly and understandably, the definition of the territory affected by the influence of the construction," the decision reads.
The magistrate also considers illegal that some documents for the decision were issued to the documentation initially discussed, but that has changed.
This is the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be built on the land of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the file material that, however, the owner of the land has only documented the consent to the project documentation for territorial proceedings, not the consent to the placement of the construction on their land, writes the Department of the Construction Code.
According to Francesca Augusta Razetta of the investment firm, the building code department did not take note of the decision of the supervisory body - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for initiating the review has already expired.
In any case, this is a scandal.
“We have been preparing this project for 17 years, we are complying with all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions involved,” Razetto said in a statement.
The project, which people call marshmeloun because of the allegedly proposed color of the facade, is provoking strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people have gathered in the city centre to protest the construction.
The associations and residents of nearby houses are bothered that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inadequacy of the construction for the historic center of Prague and the immediate neighborhood of the Anež Monastery.
The house was designed by the architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project has changed several times.
The original form of the project from 2008, which counted on a glass facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Monument Institute (NPÚ) and revoked in 2010 the permission of Prague monuments.
The new project of the company Praga Progetti e Investimenti with windows in the shape of faces but the NPU and the magistrate monuments approved and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the grievances of opponents, saying he never counted on a facade in pink color, which gave the project the nickname of a pink-white candy farm.
Czech politicians are taking immigrants.
The Hungarians put him in the basement.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On the way, he and his crew took three Syrian refugees into the car, who allegedly wanted to travel about half a kilometer.
At the time, he said it was not criminal in Hungary, he told the People's Daily.
We knew that law enforcement did not affect such actions.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, we were arrested and taken to an investigative detention facility in Szeged.
The politician spent nine hours in the prison.
The officersly behaved correctly, but communication was difficult because they didn’t speak English very well.
His prison was sad.
For example, in our cell, about three times four meters in size, 15 Syrian refugees were strained.
Among them was a 2-year-old boy or a 4-year-old girl.
These people were locked there the next day and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen next, Berg said.
What is not fun anymore?

Metcash Launches Rural Campaign to Fight Aldi Invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the Aldi attack in South and West Australia.
Metcash Launches Rural Campaign to Fight Aldi Invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in Southern and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are joining with brands such as Dunsborough-based Simmo’s ice cream maker offering tasting in IGA stores and store owners selling discounted tickets to the Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to disclose further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and hardware dealer will celebrate its annual investor strategic day.
There is a lot at stake, as Southern and Western Australia account for 30 percent of Metcash IGA business moves and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Customers in Southern and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states.
Anyway, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi has gained 5 percent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening the first stores, which have taken over sales from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the west over the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in the Metcash fixed price base could cost him around $13 million in pre-tax revenues, Mr. Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly against Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that buyers at IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash food sales to drop by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will drop from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, fund chief Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said business lunches in Melbourne could “highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly respond to Douglass's comment.
But it is known that a member of the Metcash board contacted Douglasse last week.
IGA’s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and earnings from the Metcash food trade, which supplies about 1,200 retailers to IGA, have dropped by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational trend of changing speculation as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesale has moved into a counterattack, investing more than $150 million a year to match the Coles and Woolworths counter prices on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers re-equip their stores by adding fast-growing food and news from private retailers.
Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says pricing and store refinancing programs are catching up and hopes that wholesale will return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a side loss in a recent whisper around his boyfriend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior, said Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often referred to as the "Special Ks," has caught unwelcome attention due to an affair with the notorious Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison then stated, "Wawrinka had one to stretch for Kyrgios and I had to stretch for him too."
While he was last seen breaking a rocket after his cramp hindered a possible defeat of Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Kokkinakise firmly defended Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for a place in the second duel behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
“I was thinking very intensely that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little stuck in the whole dispute,” Healy said.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost because of a crash in the U.S., but he is not the first player to be angry with his rocket because of his frustration.
But seriously he did very well because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the U.S. because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves great recognition.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he has been treated a bit harshly.
He’s a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard and fits great into the team and so on, he’s never had a problem with other players, he’s very respected in the dressing room, he’s training hard, he’s in amazing shape, he’s a very stable and mature young guy and I simply think he deserves to be judged by his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios due to an important match starting on Friday, stating that “mutual decision” is the right solution for everyone, but encourages the Canberry native to return to the team as a long-term stallion.
“First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the match and not on all the controversy that has arisen around him [Kyrgios],” Healy says.
And I think Nick has risen very fast, as Federer, Murray and others point out, he’s growing fast in the eyes of the public, he’s also made a few terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he’s getting, but we’re trying to support him, we’re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time out of the slant when he’ll be able to think about it is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and also for him himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the state of danger announcement, Hungary on Tuesday closed its southern border with Serbia and detained those who tried to illegally cross it in order to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants accumulated in the country of no one and the Serbian authorities reacted indignantly.
Those who are stuck for an unknown period of time in the land between the two states stand those who flee violence in their native countries, build tents and settle.
There is a feeling of frustration.
When a helicopter passes over them, the migrants shout together “Open the border!” and cheer to the police.
Some refuse food and water.
The Serbian Foreign Minister said it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be a part of the solution, not just an indirect harm.
During the next few days it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries,” says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at ongoing meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in surprise Italy and Greece and spoke with the hope of reaching an eventual agreement next month or by the end of the year that EU nations would accept more than 120,000 additional refugees, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday convened a special EU summit another week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday’s state of danger in two southern regions gave authorities greater power to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up judicial asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to build a fence of oak wire along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled from Syria and other Middle East countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them are economic migrants seeking a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalize violations of the 4-meter fence that the government has allowed to build on the southern border with Serbia, and also stipulates longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
“Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,” the government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
It is clear that crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Technically, parliament still needs to approve the military deployment, which was expected next week, but Associated Press reporters on the border have observed a heavily armed troop with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Viktor Orban’s domestic defense adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said authorities had arrested 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 had already been caught in the state.
They have penetrated by damaging the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing offenses under the new laws.
The authorities quickly fixed the fence.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossing points with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a trailer covered with a barbed wire.
Chaos arose at the main border crossing near Roszke, as the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and a crowd of people emerged.
About 20 entered, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary as they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's Leap Over Bernie Sanders Halved in National Voting
Former Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is hitting her lead.
Clinton is now backed by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (a drop from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (a rise from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether or not he wants to become president, gains the support of 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of major competitions, the most democratic voters say it’s too early to say they’re clearly making a decision which candidate they’re going to support.
But Clinton sponsors are more confident about their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month’s CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground under her feet in several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained a few.
Clinton isining a big advantage among women and easing, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among men has declined significantly and Sanders loses only 5 points on her.
Clinton’s advantage over Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and they are now equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has a big leadership thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a two-digit advance over Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders loses only 5 points in this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across states say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with certain reservations and another 15 percent would support her only because she is a candidate.
6% would not support it.
It’s not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are enthusiastic about her.
Views are mixed among those currently not supporting Clinton—only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), it follows that it is time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, there is a great option of choice and agreement on problems.
While the Vice-President is considering a potential presidential candidacy, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to take the lead – a third of them think he shouldn’t.
When primary Democratic voters were asked whom they would choose as a second choice for a party nomination, the most common choice was Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half listed Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden is running, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, this figure dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely eligible is increasing.
However, when the question of the greater importance of a candidate arose, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over a greater chance of being elected.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate appears as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t think so about him.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are consistent with their ideological views.
As for all these criteria, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s decision to use her personal email and server as Secretary of State continue, most primary Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn’t affected their overall view of her at all.
But among the American public, this is a completely different story.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinions on the subject were divided in March, shortly after the issue came out.
Most Americans say the email controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent say their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
Most of them are Republicans, with more than six out of ten saying that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy among the voters of her party, this issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, a drop of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
62 percent of registered voters do not think it is honest and credible.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good scores for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush were the best candidates.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters have not made an opinion about him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ends up behind Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest poll, and the rest are left to seek support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump with an overwhelming majority, climbing from 23% in the latest CBS poll before the Fox News debate last month to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson ran well across demographic groups, and ranks Trump out among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorino and Ohio Governor John Kasiche, is behind together with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker completely down from a 10% support dropped to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all jointly in third place with 6%.
The error margin for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed that Carson improved and reached 19% support among Republicans behind Trump’s 32% support.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post also revealed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson’s rising trend, Trump decided to shoot blindly at a neurosurgeon in service, and even Carson apologized for questioning about Trump’s belief.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during the Iowa campaign.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Murder of Baruch College First Year Student
Nearly two years after a student died during an overwhelming brotherly ritual in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, charges of murder were filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs Brotherhood brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Denga during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Police report that he had blind eyes, wore a backpack full of sand weighing a total of 30 pounds, and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach his target through frozen fields.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Dogs Brotherhood did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and allegedly waited an hour before being taken to the hospital, police said.
However, they found time to change Deng's dress, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national brotherhood president, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a news conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and essentially preferred the welfare of brotherhood over the life of Michael Deng,” said Chief Wagner.
He was unable to recover and died the next morning.
According to the report, Deng was repeatedly hit with a dull object in his head, torso and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated as a result of brotherhood overload and at least one student dies every year from overload since 1970,” Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, wrote in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must take responsibility, and this step is important for the institutions.
The Grand Jury of Monroe County recommended a third-degree murder charge for the top five members.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with excessive exploitation and criminal association.
“We want to arrest not only those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, either officially or informally, we will bring them to justice as well,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity and the national fraternity canceled its relationship with local branches.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
Rates will rise and the bull market will crumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know all this.
What we do not know is how much time it will take and how long it will take.
For economics specifically offers the history of a small originator about timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rate hike starts, but rather on the trajectory of how long the normalization will take.
There are more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can be assured that any whisper due to an increase in speed can be exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of ‘cheap money,’” said Julian Jessop, senior global economist at Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more common but still low levels to create a seismic shock that many might fear.
That means there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has recorded over the past cca month, the expected rise in rates can make the air a bit volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend to re-stop stocks 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed raise.
To be more precise, the market is often the most — about 14 percent — in the past 35 years to rise rates in relatively flat 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 percent), and then return to normal after 500 days, with an average yield from the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief stock strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle and the return is beginning to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but increasing rates often help it.
Currently, the Fed is facing some conditions that hadn’t existed before and could accelerate the recession.
The most remarkable is that gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in history when Fed rates rise.
According to Deutsche Bank, during 118 rate increases since 1950, the nominal annual GDP growth has been below 4.5 percent only twice.
Despite the fact that in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, few expect it to remain, when in the third quarter it was at just 1.5 percent, the Atlanta Fed reports.
Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question could arise, “Is this time different,” Deutsche said.
Market participants were prepared for the Fed’s growth all year round and all eyes turned to the Federal Free Market Committee meeting that took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve the increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
“In our study since 1950, all uplifting cycles so far have been in a super leverage cycle with GDP covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the beginning of the recovery,” the report says.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery since the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we are still going on.
A solid return has also been volatile as the market expects rates to rise and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable for bonds than for stocks when the Fed changes its policy.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first increase/decrease cycle arrives.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields drop immediately,” Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that an increase in rates will cause returns to approximate between long- and short-dated bonds, which will balance the curve.
High yield bonds often work better in this climate, although “we’re still cautious about tightening yields,” said Kathy Jones, a firm fixed-rent analyst at Schwab in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adjusted to the expectations of the Fed’s policy.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospects of a stricter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is wider, the credit margin has expanded, and volatility has increased – all characteristics of the market as the Fed tightened the policy.
Generally speaking, companies that conduct most of their business in the U.S. will win after interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will get worse because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt will also be greater.
“History shows that the ‘quality’ of stocks tends to surpass within three months of the initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachs said in a client report.
Firms with strong balances outperformed weak balances in each interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns, as well as stocks with low volatility, also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts on average by 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of variable interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside the purely stock game, consumers also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticized this station for "blaming"
He is becoming more and more distinct from his commercial rival.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they just cheat the British
Deputy colleague Damien Collins attacked Voice and says he’s not an original idea either
BBC Radio 3 is “changing” into Classic FM, the leading MP claims, accumulating fresh pressure on broadcasting to prove they are doing something commercial broadcasting doesn’t do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC chiefs that the public service radio station appears to be "blundered" and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
“Radio 3 seems to be — I don’t like to use the word ‘fooled’ — but it seems to be changing to Classic FM,” he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, appears to be British under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different – these are two examples that attack me, when you’re actually just imitating what we already have on the market,” Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC’s chief executive rejected the allegations on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its business rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I’t learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to living with music and making music is actually at the top level.
“I also think Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important,” he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that got under fire for kicking business competitors on foot during the broadcasts of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the commission’s hearing.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as unoriginal and not different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars of Paloma Faith and Boy George shine as judges - was made "in a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to “find a hit from its own stable” the next time it starts a fun series.
However, he declined to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending license payers’ money on other formats of entertainment.
Online sales are growing at the slowest pace since August, and Black Friday may be the blame
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%
Last month saw the lowest growth since the start of recording in 2000.
Online sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe November’s Black Friday could be a reason to slow spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise and has turned many of the UK’s main streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say there are signs of stagnation in online sales, and new figures show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending in August represented the lowest increase in growth since the very beginning of measurement in 2000, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs of stagnation in online sales, and new figures show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
“When you look at the growth levels of past years and go back to 2000, the situation has always rationalized over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the couch.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore it seems to decline.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe customers could refrain from shopping before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, more than five times the average buyers turned to their computers to arrange purchases and scrapped several vendor websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which shoppers re-contract, can hold customers away from further purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 out of every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of the cradle crash in Mecca and the family of Bin Laden was sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia is partly blaming for the collapse of the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of a crane crash at the Grand mosque in Mecca.
Dressed to a certain extent in white, the mourning chose the path and paid tribute to the victims when the first of the fallen came on their last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaissem.
A sad message was passing around the holy place, where only a few days earlier a construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and collapsed on the believers.
The bodies were released for the funeral and the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family’s building group over the disaster, which also left 394 wounded.
The bodies of 29 dead after a crane crash at the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the hadj to Mecca will be held and thousands continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not leave the shoulder of the crane up when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi news agency, states that Binladin Group is partially responsible for the fall.
The English service of the record agency did not report this detail, but said that the bosses of the company were banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to uncover what caused the crane to fall into the Grand Mosque courtyard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims curve before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not issued any statements about the crash of the crane and its representatives have not been made available for comment.
The royal decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
Binladin’s family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades and are running large construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was the son of an apostate whom the family abandoned in the 1990s.
The crash occurred amidst a strong wind and rain just a few days before millions of people in the kingdom went on a pilgrimage that every capable Muslim must undertake at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in hospital.
Officials determined that one million riyals (£174,000) would be given to the relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of that amount.
B&Q CEO Says Eastern European Dealers Working For Cheap Is A Trend
Brits are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of educated traders from Eastern Europe is behind the growth point
The result is the opening of 200 Screwfix trades aimed at traders
Kingfisher to close 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to lay off hammer and brushes and hand them over to employed educated Eastern European craftsmen to work at home.
If you can do it with a hammer or a painting brush, you seem to be in the minority today.
Because Brits are increasingly hiring craftsmen to do crafts at home, according to the head of the company behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a home supplier chain, says the large increase in the number of educated retailers from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 additional Screwfix stores aimed at traders, and shuts 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laury says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better half.
Currently, most workers are male.
She said there is a need to address rising demographic trends that show more female households making more home adjustments than in the past.
Ms. Laury says: “We still work mostly with men in the shops.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, who make 80% of the purchasing decisions.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Laury, who is one of only five women in the leadership of leading firms according to the UK FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect the equality between man and woman executives.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in the fact that it has a half-representation of women among employees including executive and financial directors.
Mrs. Laury says: “It was a conscious decision – diversity is an important topic here.
So it was not difficult to find good women that we would take to us.
Kingfisher a decline in both mid-year profits and sales after the group took on the cost of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores
The December pension allowance of SEK 600 is in danger.
“It’s the justice of a flat stomach, it has nothing to do with human justice,” said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
ODS Deputy Chairman Zbyněk Stanjura noted that the one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better to be in standard valorization, because it would be projected into the next years.
“We have room to find a mechanism to arrange this,” Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marks (ČSSD), according to which the next year should be valorized beyond the law.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she says is not pink.
A higher valorization next year would mean a budget impact of SEK 5.5 billion, and ministers are debating about every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the rate of valorization has decreased.
Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) noted that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and beyond.
The right-wing veto will significantly complicate, and even make it impossible, the salary in December, he said.
The Chairman of the members of the ČSSD Roman Sklenák therefore proposed to shorten the deadline for the discussion of the norm in the committee to ten or 20 days, even the right blocked it.
This will take a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus will cost a total of SEK 1.73 billion.
The money comes from the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions are expected to rise by an average of about a stock corona.
The pension will be paid to those who will be entitled to a pension or a portion of it in December.
Those who lost their right to a pension before it was paid in December will also be eligible.
They would have to submit a written request at the latest by the end of next year.
In the Czech Republic, pensions are valued regularly as of January, by price growth and a third of real wage growth.
This year the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of the gross salary, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
According to the state final account, the state spent 314,7 billion crowns on old-age pensions last year, which was approximately five billion more annually.
Pension expenditures accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditures and 46 percent of all statutory expenditures.
The average full old-age pension increased last year, according to data in the state final account, by 104 to SEK 10,714.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 proportional pensions.
Jakunin abandoned plans for a political career, he will devote himself to science.
According to the Russian media, the billionaire had a seat in the Senate.
In the Federation Council he was supposed to represent the western Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate of the ruling United Russia party, defended his post in Sunday's elections.
According to Russian law, senators are not elected by citizens, but are chosen by a governor from among three candidates whose names will be announced before the governor elections.
After the election, the Senator will be selected by himself.
The complication for Jakunin was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for 20 years, as required by law.
The Kremlin has found an exception for Jakunin as an extraordinary and authorized ambassador, to whom the legal requirement for long-term residence does not apply.
The Czech comedy The Theory of the Tiger.
The last drop in the decision of the protagonist is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has lost his strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janžurova decided on her grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
Jan is clear that he and his wife Olga, Eliška Balzer, are on a similar path.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, he wants to live again with dignity and freedom.
He desires to regain control over his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the past, Slavík said.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in a comedic form in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning it was clear that the main role would be Bartoškovi, with whom he had already collaborated on the series The Invisible.
Nevertheless, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a longer break associated with recovery after a serious illness, surprised him.
We agreed together three years ago.
I let him read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
I was surprised that he was an outspoken athlete.
He was always asking where he would be sitting before shooting the next scene.
This time he was riding a bicycle, climbing the rocks and even walking the hill.
And all this in record tropical heat, the director noted.
According to Bartoška, women take a tiger to make him a rabbit.
They feed him a little, but immediately close the door so that he doesn’t think of playing a tiger outside the rabbit store.
And that’s what we’re trying to tell about our film, the actor commented.
His wife, who can have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was portrayed by Eliška Balzer.
She is not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathic and thinks well.
But at the same time, she is an usurpator and wants to make her husband die, Bajgar said.
The film parallelly depicts the fates of Jan’s married daughters Olinka and Alenka – Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová – and the sons of Erika and Pepíka – Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film is produced by Petr Erben of Logline Production, Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google has pledged an additional $5.5 million to organizations that help thousands of refugees flocking to Europe.
It was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, a charity site of this internet company.
Azerbaijan has cancelled part of Telić’s visit because of his criticism of human rights violations.
Czech MP Pavel Telička has postponed his planned trip to Baku on Thursday because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit.
Baku justifies this with the EP resolution of last week, which criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan and was co-authored by Telička.
Through the decision of the Azerbaijani party, Telička lost the possibility of talks with official partners and also of visiting political prisoners, which depends on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
The trip, which was planned several months in advance, Telička wanted to use to meet with the leadership of the parliament and representatives of the executive, as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners.
The resolution condemns "the unprecedented repression of civil society in Azerbaijan".
She urged European officials to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was passed shortly after the recent conviction of Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadidža Ismail, who advocated for exposing corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out the possibility of building an air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky, during his visit to Novosibirsk, did not rule out the possibility of a Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We have no such plans yet.
Nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia already has a naval base in the port of Tartus in Syria, which it has used as a service and logistics center.
According to Russian media reports, the supply of Russian weapons and military equipment to Syria has increased since the beginning of August.
According to Moscow, these are arms deliveries resulting from existing trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians intend to set up an air base near the city of Latakia, which for now remains the bastion of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington is not quite clear about Russia’s concrete military intentions in Syria, US commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke about the situation in Syria on Tuesday with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, this was their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow to express concerns about the accumulation of Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow’s support for Assad a losing bet.
The objectives of Russia’s policy in Syria are unclear.
According to him, Moscow has made Syria its satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a longer-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not quite clear.
The war in Syria is expected to be the main topic of Putin’s speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York.
On the Ukrainian side of the Donbass, the Russian leader has no intention of speaking.
According to the New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out that President Barack Obama may meet with the Russian president during the UN meeting.
But opinions among White House officials are still divided.
TASS, citing Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, said that Putin had no meeting with Obama on the agenda for his visit to New York.
Use sesame oil during the gallbladder diet, hemp helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the intake of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressed from the seeds cold, all the healthy substances will remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, they have been the most common cause of death in the Czech Republic for several years.
Inflammation of the gallbladder mainly affects women, helps sesame oil.
If you belong to the lovers of Asian cuisine, you should not miss the seashore oil, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of foods and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of gallstones.
These are the 90% cause of gallbladder inflammation and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
In general, problems with the gallbladder affect especially overweight people who do not play sports and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can be successfully used in the liver diet, which is very similar to that of the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that consumption of this oil brings, they should pay attention to goods from exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use fried seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
But the oil will lose all its active substances, described Ladislav Hačecký, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Olej from Kraslic in Sokolovsk, which produces bio virgin oils pressed cold.
The company also produces new sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our press can press out 8 kilograms of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the designation of extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, nutrients are lost.
Sunflower oil is beneficial for heart and vascular diseases.
The Czech favorite among the oils is sunflower.
From the research Jarmila Hamerské, which she led at Masaryk University, it turned out that 43% of respondents preferred it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not actually suitable for roasting, as it begins to burn at 180 ° C.
It is better to use it for salads, for example, and it is especially suitable for diet, in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which, out of all fatty acids, reduce cholesterol most.
In case of heart problems, you should be careful about the total amount of fat and calories taken.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil is 62 calories, in a tablespoon of peppermint oil is 99 calories.
As for the energy value of foods, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to use extra virgin oils.
The sunflower can last as long as the sesame and hemp for 9 months.
If stored in the refrigerator, the shelf life will be extended.
Old oil is known by its bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no dirt on the bottom.
This is a sign that the substance has not been chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Seeds of technical hemp are called superfoods, and hemp oil is considered to be the healthiest of plant oils.
This label is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids are not produced by the body and must be taken from food.
Omega 3 fatty acids are especially important.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while men in Iceland consume 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not need to fear the use of hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms the fact that Bohemia Oil is one of the best-selling in the company.
It sells 500 liters a year.
People often take one tablespoon fasting in the morning.
Hemp oil is not taste-specific, but it will greatly strengthen immunity, advised Daniel Vlček of the Kraslick company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation of grillers are Americans.
There are 1.4 bars per household.
Thro the world there are various competitions in barbecue, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs behind.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have negrilated in their lives.
Most of them barbecue several times a year.
In order for the grill to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation – it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating several hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is the most suitable for this and at the same time leaves healthy substances when barbecueing?
In general, in the process of barbecue itself, fat should be saved.
Experts agree that a large portion of oils start to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils then lose the body beneficial substances that we otherwise obtain from them when consuming oils from dishes adjusted at lower temperatures.
This does not mean that extra virgin oils will not be used in the grilling process.
Grapefruit oil for health and beauty.
When it comes to meat, the experts from Bohemia Oil of Kraslic in Sokolovsk immediately equip the grape oil.
It perfectly adds to the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, it is characterized by the unique property of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for roasting and barbecue because it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, therefore, as one of the few oils, it preserves health-beneficial substances, describes the benefits of grape oil Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Olej, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this grape oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid, and is therefore effective in the fight against excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Due to the beneficial content of these substances, it helps reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty – it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chef chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold foods, such as salads, but also for the heat treatment of foods.
It can be used in two ways: when marining and when barbecueing.
Marinating meat and fish preserves their juice.
In the preparation of the marinade, three components must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
Add acidity with apple cider vinegar, for example, to soften the meat.
Spice, in turn, gives the meat taste and oil preserves and gives the right spice, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, he adds that grape oil is ideal for marination because it can pass through dark meat as one of the few oils.
Marinated meat or fish are therefore ready for barbecue, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that just a few drops of them are enough to prepare dishes.
The same applies to grilling.
Some oils are absolutely taboo for this method of preparation.
This especially applies to flaxseed, hemp and pepper oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before the barbecue, rub the roast with oil, thus preventing the burning of food.
The preparation of the attachments is also an essential part of the grill.
Virtually anything is suitable for grilled meat and fish - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia Olej recommend, for example, a hot summer salad.
To do this, you need: • 1 piece of peaches • 1 bundle of rukola • 1 cup of sliced cucumbers • 1 cup of salad leaves mixture • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad dish to the mixture of salad leaves a crushed rukola, chopped cucumbers and chopped peaches on large cubits.
In accordance with the taste of salt and pepper, you can also smooth with ground chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, add a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can spray the salad with fine-cut almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it depends not only on medications, but also on the patient’s will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: a neurologist, physiotherapist, ergotherapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need consultation if they decide to have a child, social-legal advice, recommendations for adjusting housing, etc. are included in the care of these sick people.
Nevertheless, all this is not enough: the development of the disease can fundamentally affect the patient himself.
The more he will actively fight the disease, the longer he can work and may not fundamentally change his lifestyle.
As doctors point out, the passivity of the sick free up space for the activity of the disease.
For example, it has been shown that regular movement significantly delays the time when a sick person needs some compensatory aid, such as a rod.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subject to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up on a wheelchair.
This is why the website “Get a Chance” (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign “Get a Chance”.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, it is said twice that the sooner the disease begins to be treated, the more the doctor can influence something.
This is because we have medicines for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we can stop the disease and delay disability, explains Dr. Eva Medová of the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Very important is for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often solves weakening of the lower limbs or imbalance disorders.
We work with patients according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, alleviate swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It is really individual, it depends on the specific difficulties of the patient," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, primary of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Fitness Medicine of the Faculty Hospital in Motola.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but each person manifests itself in a different way.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always alleviate its symptoms.
Movement activity, however, also strengthens the immune state of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive thing about regular exercise is the fact that the sick check what they can do, and this strengthens their self-confidence.
"During exercise, endorphins are also discharged and a person feels good after it," says Dr. Kamila Řasová of the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine of the Royal Vinohrad Faculty Hospital.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
Directly, we interfere with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease.
"In the past, these patients were so-called saving, today we know that they need a targeted load," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Fitness Medicine of the Faculty Hospital in Motola.
The goal of physiotherapy is to allow a person to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including work.
Therefore, physiotherapists cooperate with ergotherapists so that each person receives a compensatory aid tailored to him.
Many patients need psychiatric or psychiatric care.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people are shocked by it.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
It has to respond to a great burden - the loss of health.
With such a painful soul, we must go to someone, not try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them so that they eventually come to the conclusion that even with a disability you can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová-Schubert from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without Latecoere, the airbus would not be able to fly.
Aircraft manufacturing is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or lightweight and solid composite materials that no one can manufacture or process.
Nevertheless, in addition to super-precise, computer-controlled machinery, along with autoclaves for composite shaping, you can find something so common, such as apricots.
In the drum, which resembles a pot for sugar cotton, the edges of the blade parts that just came out of the frying machine are washed in a bunch of bakes.
"So far, no one has come up with anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of Latecoere Czech Air Door Manufacturer.
At the facility in Prague’s Letňane, the former company manufactures complete doors for the Airbus A320.
As the only in the world, they supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
Through the doors, part of which is being built in Prague, passengers can also enter the first and upper class on the upper deck of the world’s largest transport aircraft Airbus A380.
There are also doors filled with composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Precision is the main motto.
For instance, the moment keys let the company set up twice a year.
If the yellow sticker lacks a check record, they should explain something to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing at the Prague plant, who regularly check whether the doors are manufactured according to agreed rules.
Human senses have not yet been completely replaced by advanced technology.
There are 1,500 nits on one door for the A320.
These must be hand-held.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the falling hammer, they will know if the hammer is already correctly opened.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
It can rise from zero to 0.13 millimeters above the surface of the aircraft.
This is about twice the thickness of a human hair.
During the inspection, there will be a number of exercises.
When the controller moves through a series of nodes, he recognizes if any of them are out of tolerance.
Then take a precise measurement in hand.
The flight was fueled by the training program of the military aircraft L-39 before 1989.
In 1991, no one was produced.
The company had to quickly find new contracts.
The aircraft was manufactured by the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
It won the tender for an emergency door supplier for the A321.
Talks with Boeing were not so happy.
"We were a small company for them at the time, who didn't have enough money to invest and to guarantee long-term stable deliveries to Boeing," Dubsky recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would remain blurred if Letov did not enter the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the international aviation industry association in 1999.
We talked about our partnership with Airbus.
The next day we started negotiations with the French, says Dubsky.
A year later Latecoere bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new orders.
In 2000, the assembly of the door parts for the A320 began.
Three years later, the doors of the upper deck for the A380 were opened.
In 2006, the company built a new hall for composite processing for the delivery of the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we would not have reached these big contracts on our own.
Maybe we could make parts or small parts.
The partners want guarantees of supplies for twenty or thirty years, Dubský explains.
Last year, Latecoere achieved a turnover of more than 2.9 billion and a profit after taxation of SEK 147 million.
Exclusive status among aircraft manufacturers’ suppliers is not free.
Latecoere has invested SEK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have certificates of quality, certifications of 170 special production processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company would not be able to manufacture aircraft doors.
Obtaining certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers, and in repeated checks to keep them costs, according to Dubsky, millions of crowns.
Manufacturing processes change every year.
They are more precise and strict.
We need to train the staff, equip the equipment and re-certify the entire process, Dubský adds.
Now, the company is completing the preparation of the process for zinc and nickel covering, which will replace the previously harmful cadmium for human health.
They received the assignment from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing will come and check the concept of the entire line.
We will show them the production.
We will also inspect the laboratory.
They test one set of samples themselves in their lab and then compare the results with ours, Dubsky approximates the way customers check them.
The reward is long-term exclusive contracts for the Prague company.
With the Prague plant today the production of embraers stands and falls.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door volume.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
However, this does not mean that you can buy at any price.
The contract includes a price curve.
This indicates how much one door will cost for ten, fifty, hundred pieces made.
The price continues to fall to a certain limit.
We have to get into this price model.
If not, we will lose, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall where the electric cabinets for the Airbus A400M are being completed is currently empty.
It is a symbol of the future.
Behind the wall is a new semi-robot line for nitting and mounting doors for the upgraded A320 Neo.
It accelerates and clarifies.
“That is the trend by which aircraft assembly is taking off,” adds Dubsky.
The future line is secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have ordered 3,278 A320s so far.
Just a few meters away, there will be a line for the complete assembly of the doors for the upper deck of the A380.
This is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
The full installation could begin in two years, says Dubsky.
Previously, however, the company must pass qualifying tests for installing some electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also investing in the further development of composite materials production.
In addition to Boeing, it will also participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge credit for a company to be able to process composites in addition to metal materials," Dubsky says proudly.
Latecoere is on the brink of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no other place in the area where he is located.
Before the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now there are 800, and in three years there could be 100 more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of how many hundreds of new aircraft airlines order each year, they don’t have to worry about the job.
Although it has contracts for several years ahead, the parent company of Prague Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money to repay the September loans.
In the end, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the major creditors.
At the end of August, some of their loans were exchanged for shares.
The creditors gained a 37.4% share in the company by increasing the capital by EUR 57.4 million.
The company’s debt decreased by two-thirds, or 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company signed new shares for EUR 222.9 million among existing shareholders.
In total, it raised its capital by EUR 280 million.
At the same time, the entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of sales.
Average procurement growth is expected to be four percent annually until 2017.
In the custom book it has orders for 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to a four-year production.
French media claims Latecoere is finally able to breathe again after years on capsules.
The Czech race in Prague Summer is significant for the groups.
It accounts for 16% of the group’s sales.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the Group.
Parliament voted for a greater share of coal taxes.
The change in mining fees is expected to bring to the state treasury 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
The government has a neutral impact on municipal budget revenues, as the fee is expected to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns from fees and 150 million crowns from the state budget.
From the mining of brown coal, the municipalities spent about 200 million kronor and the state 66 million.
The new law also envisages an increase in the allowance for extraction of land to 1,000 crowns per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments will continue to belong in full to the municipalities.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the MPs that municipalities will receive annually, instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its decree.
The reimbursement shall be newly calculated as a combination of the amount of extracted mineral and the rate for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
But ODS member Marek Benda warned that the establishment of the fee by a government decree may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to the Minister, however, this is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral, which is the state property.
Only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining receive fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the money will be given to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same is true of radioactive mining.
Part of the money collected by the state on mining fees will be targeted.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The proposal was criticized by opposition lawmakers, wholy argued that it would damage the communities affected by the mining and the counties.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining firms will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to make the Minister of Finance improve the budget," said David Kádner (Usvit) elected in Ústecký kraj.
From the rise of unemployment in Mostecko warned MP Hana Aulická.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the novel, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The reasoning report says that according to the mining companies, the increase in taxes will not affect coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent long-term negotiated.
Major consumers such as power plants or heat plants should therefore not feel the price rise.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, he believes that the increase in taxes is acceptable.
According to Milan Urban (ČSSD), the rapporteur on the novel, it is crucial that the MPs know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and especially the government’s decision on coal mining limits before the bill is approved.
If coal is extracted beyond the limits, it will have an impact on the revenue for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit on the mining of the Czechoslovak army should fall only after 2020.
The limits on the ČSA mine should be broken for social, national and economic reasons, as well as for the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is watching the U.S. Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain inactive for some time and keep interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event since it’s been a year since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank could be able to get out of the zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior executive at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy went relatively well, there was a recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less pink global outlook.
They have warned the markets to be prepared for the rise, but the circumstances suggest that they also see great chances against this move.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 p.m.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on the same day his colleague - wrote a message saying he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished he could take it back, government officials revealed on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi said Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around ten o’clock.
He said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send police to his house.
He said, “I shot my wife last night” and also mentioned that there is a “sweet dog” in the house that “will not bother anyone,” but is upset.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but Lamb did not present himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the shooting occurred in the house.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from Lamba stating: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me.”
After leaving the message, Lamb embarked on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
William LaForge, dean of the university, said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "something was obviously going on in Mr. Lamba's head."
Despite Monday’s statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss’s romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was “no evidence” of a “love triangle.”
Shawn O'Steen, who had been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was "a great person."
They divorced 15 years ago, but they remain friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O’Steen and Prentiss was “shocked” by the whole case.
O’Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were “best friends.”
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home over the internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help others,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he "will not go to jail."
When he was caught by police on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the forest, where he shot himself.
According to a CV published on the school’s website, Lamb received a PhD in Education from Delta University in the spring of 2015.
The stars who lost their magic
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
He fought with leukemia in 2001 and lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer in 2009.
The actor also allegedly had a drug problem and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of these things have their own taxes.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out of play for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back left this injury in tears and dropped him out of play for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless intervention by Hector Morena in the 15th minute, when 20-year-old Shaw penetrated into the PSV space.
He was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed an oxygen mask before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe after tomorrow and then operated in Manchester.
It’s terrible – a boy who comes to Manchester at 18 years old has it very hard, but he plays fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in the dressing room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I’m not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he will play this season.
Moreno was very lucky not to get a red card and a penalty kick.
The judge, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a terrible operation with both legs.
A tweet from Shawa’s account says: “Thank you all for their messages, words can’t express how ruined I am, my journey to recovery starts now and I’ll come back even stronger.”
Related: Manchester United recorded Luke Shawa injury in defeat against PSV
The English defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “It was a very ugly injury.”
When any player leaves the pitch with such a injury, everyone is very sad about it.
The goal of our players is never to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture during a match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very hard for him because his intention was not to hurt an opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such a injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I was not able to see this moment.
I only saw the ball heading in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched him, but I didn’t see an intervention on Luka.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I am very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after the intervention of Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows The Lorax better.
Every parent knows this: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn’t take long for him to remember it.
You can’t be David Cameron.
Asked by a children’s scheme provider to name a favorite children’s book, Prime Minister Lorax chose a 1971 fairy tale by Dr. Seusse.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: “A funny, touching, creative and with strong content, such I loved reading to my children because behind it was always an image or a message I had never seen before.”
Well, until then, in the following paragraph, Cameron allegedly described the plot of the book according to an elevator from the 2012 film, which added additional characters and details to fill out a brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," is the brief content of the book recording the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it wasn’t suspicious enough, the text delivered by Cameron is read as a summary of the Lorax film, which is found on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: “In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey.”
Because he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not get acquainted with the plot of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is devastated by the crawling, tree-cutting industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the title Lorax, a shrunken, hairy creature who "speaks for trees."
Most likely, such a relatively insignificant PR task was given to an assistant who never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A spokeswoman for Downing Street said the text probably came from the office of Cameron’s supporters.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of being neglected by England, but still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after looking at the team England has chosen for this tour, I think it will be unlikely to repeat the 3-0 defeat they suffered last time in the test series.
I would also not exclude the guests.
Alastair Cook’s party may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players here in this sparking team and the collective thinking is strong; they don’t carry the scars of 2012, just youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test series level, represents an offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of England team in the trial series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is a tough piece to analyze for me because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in tough conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged by performance.
For example, there were no questions around the name of Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because — and I mentioned this earlier — players are their best selectors.
A few more half a century and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control over his own fate.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, another opportunity will appear.
England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performance wasn’t 100%, and that doesn’t surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much trial time a slicker will get to show up is a tough thing.
Lyth got seven caps — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outside.
The only thing you could remcat for is that England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was in his best shape — but this missed opportunity is already a past.
Alex Hales is here, and it’s a palker that I’m very positive about.
He is an x-factor cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when he won 236 against us on Trent Bridge, which he did a little bit.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all this will, of course, depend on the overall composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of when Moeen starts alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while retaining four quicks, has been raised and I have no reservations against it.
I don’t understand why the strokemaker can’t kick off and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number three for them and there’s no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 trials before he performed in 2001.
Three centuries passed and he didn’t even look at him.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to watch him, he captivated me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his gross statistics — an average of 31 with a stick and 35 with a ball — and I see it as a prime, but there are not a lot of spinners to raise their hands, and the selectors have chosen youth.
You will learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have made a few changes and smart additions to their coach staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan wrestler, as a test match consultant can be a masterpiece.
He is one of the most beautifully playing guys who will bring a rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and brings both energy and a ruthless spark to the team.
I always felt like he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can occasionally lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham’s co-star Ben Stokes got a one-day break, just like Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many disagree on this, coaches and selectors do not create a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions should never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts stagnating by 2017.
David Cameron’s unthought-out renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets into further trouble with each passing day even without the election of Jeremy’s brilliant “Is It Yes or No?” Corbyn to the head of the Labour Party, or the TUC takes the whole situation around Europe to parade on Tuesday.
They also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises — not all of which are their fault — some member states are already tired of the British egocentric agenda, dividing concessions, and disruptive treaty changes they mostly did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they did not want to do so even if they were looking for social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a photo in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home with the words that they are winning allies for reform.
It is all about me.
My European friend who wants an untouched Britain in Europe – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” says Berlin – suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to a point where they don’t care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a cautiously balanced German chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as was the case with too long-running Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French President Francois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power also falls.
Poland could soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It’s hard to watch them break their legs with the help of British Selfies, who could better invest their energy in preventing Scotland from leaving the UK – something they themselves don’t want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may plan deliberately useless SNP-style notes during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, a friend says.
"Re-negotiation solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value from negotiating."
Europeans, to their own detriment, know how predatory Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical the press oligarch barons are about the EU, because they were not during a referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our accession in 1973 in a ratio of 2:1.
They may bluntly remember the name of Boris Johnson, a rebellious Euro-opportunist who made his name as a Brussels reporter of “EU straight bananas” in the early 1990s.
Despite his arrogance, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of tax-free villains, phones-hacking aliens, and pseudo-foreign departments that owned most of the big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same about them, but realized that when you’re in a cage with a mad gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she doesn’t give you dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum routine, since Blair admitted the principle of the repealed EU constitution, which was submerged by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned him a kick-off card.
The press has never forgiven him.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who amicably tossed my back on Monday in Westminster – I told him he shouldn’t waste time on me anymore – seems to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock’s Murdoch boycott strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy for media engagement, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose chair at the BBC he left on Sunday.
Corbin’s official attitude towards Europe is, I would say, evolving.
He says he wants to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the furious tendency of the Ukip and the wild shores of Tory’s little Englanderism can come to it.
The same was said by Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week when his inner scout could not be determined to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his grandfather fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary’s match was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay “in all circumstances” — Bennin’s phrase — appears to be not what McDonnell said, nor what JC said to colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday evening,
Whatever the background, the sensitive picture that Corbyn wants to convey—remember, he touched me too—the discipline of the news remains important in the age of day-to-day television broadcasts and especially in the belief, the paranoia and betrayal site that social media is.
It’s fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to consider Labour’s support for the referendum campaign a matter of course, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell’s and Corbyn’s fundamental outcry about EU membership – in line with their Bennite-occupied economy, their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for whom narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic haunting.
As with his crackdown on NATO – Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign won’t want to end it – foreign diplomats will be required to try to understand the meaning of it all for their home masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital – they also have suspicious voters – for Britain’s concessions when it seems useless?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the brisk “weak military performance” in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in cutting the cost of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded on Monday’s launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize review of electronic published by Public Health England
The government-funded agency’s statement that e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet criticism of the evidence used in their e-cigarette report by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency released a “interim” report last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of evidence.”
However, several researchers have challenged the extent of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An introduction to the expert journal Lancet last month attacked the “extremely hassle base” on which the PHE agency based its main findings.
Two other experts writing for BMJ have challenged the claim that was allegedly “built on rock or sand.”
Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They state that the public could expect the PHE’s claim that sounds “currently the best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” are based on a thorough review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called to develop a multi-criterion decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell report that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO allegedly had previously obtained funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the public health mandate of the BAT in the Sustainability Report, he states.
One in 12 participants in the meeting admitted funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding it allegedly received earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also claim industrial funding in newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in anti-smoking.
The PHE meeting was also attended by the tobacco management.
The report generated in this group “excuses,” the missing “hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most criteria,” McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said the PHE’s claim that “there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers” was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the claims at BMJ had already been answered earlier.
He said: “Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two smokers will die because of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but we need to continue to investigate long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about the relative hazards compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By highlighting the current evidence – that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking – we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should end EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would “give the right hand” to hit shows like Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other UK television broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs, which will likely be watched by only a handful of people, into difficult broadcast times compared to its rivals' 'biggest rating shows', and on channels like BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had unsuccessfully tried to connect with the BBC for the entire six years he worked on Channel 4.
“I’m struggling with the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programs that would be broadcast by rivals without state contributions,” Johnson said in the upper house communication committee as part of the BBC’s future talks.
If you keep licensing fees that I’m not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, you should reduce the creation of at least programs that others don’t make or don’t give.
They are broadcasting The Voice at the main broadcast time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and of course nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without contributions.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced at home.
Other channels would give them the right hand.
I don’t understand what public broadcasting is like.
I don’t think it would even weaken the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC he felt guilty of hitting the ratings “because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support.”
His commentary on the BBC’s most popular shows repeats those made by former Sky CEO Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the more hectic BBC public service programs are "passing to the BBC4, where quite often they can't measure the audience, but they fulfill their authority and can argue as they go on their hypocritical mission to justify £4bn income from licensing fees, "But of course we're doing all those obscure programs that no one is looking at."
They broadcast them when no one is watching them.
As for the license fee, Johnson told the commission: “I urge you to find a more regressive system regarding who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that £150 a year is a big sum, but for people for whom £150 is a lot, I’d be surprised if they paid so much because they don’t watch the BBC so much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who spoke before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reith mission in the sense of “informing, educating, and entertaining.”
He confirmed that a small volume of BBC production was now previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% television production and 0.1% radio - and should take the model of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, clarify and entertain."
On the topic of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were broadcast on a handful of televisions, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can see them all online.
“Sonogenetics” or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the speakers move.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
The small signals change direction when they are hit by sound impulses that are unheard for the human ear.
The pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Scientists can read and record brain activity using light
The scientists said these worms are a great demonstration of a new method called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells and activate outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation – an invasive procedure in which electrodes are injected into a patient’s brain to stimulate the brain.
Helmets usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction came when they were placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found, bubbles intensify ultrasound waves, which then pass through the body of worms.
Enhanced ultrasound waves act in the TRP-4 ion channels, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells with which they are connected, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the signals using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contained TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then applied ultrasound to the modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by micro-bubbles and transferred to the worms, where modified motor neurons were turned on.
The new method is much like optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases,” Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also be used in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture facilities - right on your threshold!
Advertisements embarrassing the British arms trade.
Watch the video on the anti-arms market from Amnesty International.
Horrible killer drones!
Fingers that break your ankle!
Three shots!
And electric ominous cushions that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
The joyful voice and caricature of metaphors leave no doubt that this ad at the world’s largest weapons fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defense and security facilities of International Veselice at the ExCeL Centre in the Docklands district of London.
DSEI Weapons Fair: Authoritarian Regimes Descending on London
But a separate campaign is also conducted with posters emerging at bus stops and metro that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Traveling to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using a font with the signs of the London metro with DLR lines becoming an image of the tank.
This September, a bunch of arms dealers will descend to the DLR...Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group has helped it to be distributed throughout London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen's key, which allegedly "gets access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not entertained by this flyposting “vandalism.”
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and expert assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly challenging and trying to show political activity to audiences outside the gallery.
Many artists move to work with activists within protest movements and realize they have to get out in the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the posters against the arms trade health passengers in the subway.
Amnesty’s video was viewed on Facebook by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by VCCP working free of charge and the graphic designer and commentator also worked free of charge.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the weapons trade ads — he saw an empty space in the ExCeL calendar — and thought, “Let’s show them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They play with creating more realistic, risky corporate advertising, but “by adding bright colors and animation, I’ve made it more attractive for more people.”
“They did a fantastic job and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the trade fair,” said Tom Davies at Amnesty International.
What we need now is that the UK government take action to ensure that the torture equipment is not illegally traded on our threshold.
Per the most creative art surrounding the arms business comes from inside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army for "on the shoulder launchers AT4CS RS."
This includes a “uniquely shaped head that provides stunning effects from behind the armor inside the target.”
Whatever it is, it will not be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Student Life
11 years ago I moved to college as a negligent nineteenth-year-old, still believing in baret and moral relativism, but only now I get the tense smiles of those I bothered – and numerous, long complaints about others.
Everything I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on the tracks can range from slightly nervous to totally shocking.
It’s tempting to fool: tell people where you’re from, if you’ve taken a year off, what you think of Corbyn, and why “you honestly don’t love or hate Marmite, because people, it’s just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I’ll be in my room.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe too – ask and show interest.
It controls the conversation and helps you find the people you love and those you’t have fun with even if your eyelids were on the same fire and they were issuing fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often change into drinking receptions, place for movie evenings, and public communal spaces, but they are also rooms where people dress up and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don’t even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts are coming up.
Your room should be a shelter, yet a lot of tracks turn into an out-of-room walking culture that is friendly, sociable and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This can be a hell for someone who needs to be charged.
No culture allows you to say, “I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so that I can get back to the energy I needed to talk to you.”
Try to recognize when a classmate is tired of socializing – and maybe write to him instead of tapping.
When it comes to knocking: knock.
One guy in my ranks had the habit that if the door is not locked, he is invited inside.
He saw a few things.
Make friends with baking.
Because you started going to university on the top of a baking mania, knocking on a stranger’s door and performing with a slice of baked cakes seems slightly less strange, less than “Welcome to the neighborhood, something I baked for you, now smile while I’m asking personal questions.”
Offering home delicacies is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you and maybe everything will end up giving your face a delicious surprise.
This is because you are a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and thirst are likely to make others pretend to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Theft of food is a common crime in college.
Stealing a whole chicken is, of course, a crime, but is a drop of milk in your tea a theft?
Check with the owner of the milk.
There’s a chance they’ll offer you milk even if they’re raining inside.
If someone steals something from you, it’s annoying and you have my sympathy – but try dealing with it a little more adult than my roommate, who exchanged her milk for a dishwasher to punish the thief.
He is now in prison.
You should not make sounds that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It’s not just about being a decent human being, you’re also famous people in glass houses.
A girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could silence a little drum and bass because they were 3 in the night and in the morning she had a letter.
Their response was to reinforce the music.
When they were finally silent at 5 o’clock in the morning, she let them sleep for two hours and then let her own music loud, locked the door and went to her three-hour booklet.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse went to the same tracks as you?
On the contrary, would it not be awful if you mistaken your roommate for your future companion, slept together, broke up and had to see each other every day, and she would take control of your common friends as well?
Of course, you can’t command the heart – but if your sexy roommate isn’t 100% your future companion, try at least to talk a little to your weaknesses.
At the uplifting moment when you realize someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin boundary between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it’s easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their safety by hiding something from them – never destroy someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put their keys in a bottle of water, which you then put into the freezer – but never stick their things to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a difficult time with her seven-year-old baby.
His father broke up with her and she was alone in preparing and raising the offspring.
I managed to cope with the situation relatively quickly - I was very looking forward to the baby and was looking for positive things in it.
Being alone with my child, I tried not to worry.
And I definitely had hope in myself that we would not be left alone for a long time, Eva remembers today of her first pregnancy.
Already then, she met on the internet at the chat of the elderly Vaška, with whom they began to talk about their favorite films.
Vašek even brought Eve and Vítko home from the nursery, but he didn’t get too much into the role of his father-in-law.
“He then pulled out of the show for a while,” Eva described in the documentary series Four in Three.
The theme of the third series of the Czech television series is the search for happiness on the second attempt.
The care of Vítka and the financial security of the family was managed thanks to part-time work and the great help of mom and aunt.
Even the prospects for responsibility for a strange child did not eventually spoil Vaško’s affection for Eve.
Definitely they gathered around Vítkov’s second birthday and he now understands Vaška as his dad and also so addresses him.
Although Vašek already has two adult daughters, he enjoys paternity at sixty, according to his words, and also takes more care of children.
In addition to Vítka, a two-year-old Leontýnka and eventually twins were added to them.
"The wax came into our family somehow naturally, because my mother never spoke to me in relationships," says smiling Eva.
Lack of space?
At least we are close.
Twins Emma and Ela were born by a cesarean cut after Eve was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disruption in the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood of pregnant women and manifest in particular by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is threatened by premature birth and death, in the mother after birth mostly self-disappears.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eve and Vaško’s happiness, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
Emich was placed in an incubator at the intermediate department, where Vaškova’s niece, who was able to take over and accommodate her, also works.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after the transfer from JIP to the room I had it with me, she describes the difficult period after the birth of Eva.
She spent twenty days in the nursery until doctors agreed to release the baby, who in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two pounds.
Waiting for the birth of the children in the maternity house did not make Eve happy.
“I was crazy about my husband and children,” a four-year-old mother recalls the difficult moments at the department.
She also considered signing a reversal with her husband, among other things due to the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
But it did not happen, and the doctors released Eve and her twins to home care.
The story of four pregnancies and births is broadcast on T1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45 p.m.
A large number of families are able to shrink.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to get enough with an electric twin and tight conditions.
The house did not grow bigger, but Vašek made Eve happy by installing a gas cooker to make the preparation of meals for six people more comfortable.
When it’s dark, we’re going to take a taxi.
Eva is convinced that children especially perceive family well-being and a pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or humility of the house.
So far, we have done very well, better than we expected.
The mess is worse to hide in a small space and we occasionally cross the babies, but at least we are all close, smiles Eva, who can find a positive side in every situation.
The work of the illuminator in the film is not a guarantee of regular intake.
Sometimes he runs on the streets as a taxi driver.
In his sixties, according to his words, the care of the finances of the family and children physically manages, how long will it be?
“I realize that, given our age difference, one day I will be the one who will feed this family,” Eva admits in questioning the future.
She would like to go back to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four children, I’m not just an entrepreneur.
And when it’s worse, my husband and I can alternate on a taxi, jokes the sympathetic blonde.
Apple has a jo-jo effect.
They can display everything.
A more powerful processor, a camera with a greater resolution, a stronger chassis or a touch-recognizing display are the advantages of the newly introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The latter two have a negative impact on the size and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple’s previous trend was that each new generation of the iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram difference in weight to the disadvantage of the news was really negligible.
This is not the case with the new iPhones.
Compared to last year’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the weight of the smaller model increased by 14 grams, while the larger model increased by 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is not surprising that last year’s affair with bending in Apple’s pockets suffered a great deal.
The new chassis is made of a more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which has also reflected its weight.
But much more impact on it have displays.
Apple has introduced 3D Touch technology to recognize the power of touch.
To do this, the display had to be equipped with another layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the new iPhones has more than doubled compared to previous generations.
For the smaller iPhone, from 12 grams to 29 grams, and from 19 grams to 40 grams for the larger.
In the iPhone 6s, the display is the hardest used component.
The weight of only 143 grams is also achieved with this new product thanks to the depletion bark, which touched most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, the hardest used element is the battery, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessor.
Even in this case, the greatest increase is seen at the display.
The 5.5-inch iPhone 6s Plus weighs 192 grams.
The extent to which the new technology will be practical will be revealed only when used.
First users will be able to try it on Friday, September 25, when sales of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will begin in selected countries.
Have flourishes been breakfast champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists managed to find a discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlement by modern man from different times, including wall paintings, remnants of tools, and so on, and so on.
In the layer 23A, which is dated to about 30 thousand years ago, scientists have discovered something very similar to the remains of a breakfast buffet.
In fact, traces of oatmeal were found on the site, which apparently went through the process of producing today so popular flour.
At this time, the grains are first soaked, then dried, removed from the packaging, the so-called plough, then spared and scattered.
In the Paglicci cave, grains were discovered, which were apparently heated or spared, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least this is indicated by the traces of use on two stones in the cave.
The scientists were therefore unable to demonstrate in their publication for PNAS that a complete process of flour production would take place in the cave, but the similarity is actually very noticeable.
We also don’t have any evidence of how people could have eaten flour, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and maybe even warm, of course, is quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensely people used cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If the flower interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have surpassed agriculture by approximately 20,000 years.
New reports of stations in the Transportation Enterprise of the City of Brno.
So I once again listened to reporting the names of the stops in the trolley bus: Hnusáčkova, Ghost, Frázova, Spratecká.
Sure, the trolleybus was somewhat noiser, so reporting by male voice was somewhat less understandable than before when stops were by female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic it is better recognizable than the deeper male voice.
The DPMB argues that this messenger was chosen by the passengers themselves – I don’t know who, nobody asked me, but they definitely picked it out of the studio recordings taken in absolute silence, which, of course, sounded quite different than the rumour of the bus engine.
I have lived in Brno for a few decades, so the correct names of all those stops I know back, so I do not need this report, but foreigners from elsewhere, who do not know themselves in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended, can be confused and can at the end, where they accidentally reached, then claim that the stops they were supposed to take, was not at all.
Per the choice of the messenger – but better again the messenger – should be made again, and this time understated by the usual traffic noise and the engine’s riot, in which the loudspeaker’s cuddling in the bus is almost lost.
So that we don’t have to listen to the names of the stations Vodní Heršpice, Šmírova, or then Ponorná v skripajícej šalině, to which I moved in Komárov.
I suppose my old-age hearing did not deteriorate so suddenly during that single day when the messenger of the stops changed.
Before that day, I understood those reports quite well.
Good morning Comrade.
from the trailers.
Nowadays, few people know what the largest and smartest so-called comprehensive checks were during the party’s governments.
I allowed myself to remember it.
The bus was late.
I ran into the office of the dispatcher at the moment when the radio sounded that it was just seven o’clock.
“You’re lucky that you didn’t fight with the Comrade Chief, he came a minute ahead of you and he doesn’t seem to be in the mood right now,” the dispatcher noted while I was registering in the arrival book.
Thanks, I will take care.
Write to me that I am going to the districts for a revision of a small mechanization.
It won’t happen, but there are tests today.
Everyone is scared of it, scary.
What is it really about?
“You’ll see,” the dispatcher cried out.
Next time you too.
I ran into the hallway.
The door opened and the chief appeared.
Clogged, with a stone face, in a perfectly falling equinox.
“Good morning, Mr. Chief,” I greeted respectfully and quickly turned on the two buttons of the shirt.
“Good morning,” the answer sounded, and I quickly ran out to the second floor, not realizing the cold, evil tone the old man answered.
“You’re playing,” greeted me the engineer Eva, an elderly lady I had great respect for.
She said she was also the leader before her comrades dropped her.
There are tests and you will get there.
How many times have I been asked what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about it.
They say they go once every three years, they have to go to them all, and it’s pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
I say I will see.
I pulled out of the box a fascicle with periodic reports and the phone.
“Here Holcman, come to me,” the boss’s voice heard.
What annoys?
Now we met and nothing ..." I silenced, but no one answered me, each with his thoughts.
“Good morning, Comrade Chief, I came on your order,” I omelded, barely entering the chief office.
The chief was sitting at the desk and looking at some leaflets.
“Comrade mechanizer,” he said after a while, without raising his head and still looking carefully at the camper, “I don’t like your behavior at all.”
He threw the carpet onto the table, leaned onto the chair’s rear and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, pissy gaze.
I was stunned.
What is happening?
Even yesterday, the deputy praised me that in those few months in office I have worked very well and that he is very pleased with me.
That the commander did very well when he pulled me out of the squad at a distance.
And now this?
Be aware that you are a trail technician and you have to behave accordingly.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I said that I have used such a greeting since I was a child, that I was so raised and that I see nothing wrong with it.
For the boss, it was like a red cloth on a crocodile.
“You’re on the socialist railroad and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of work,” the head of the company said.
Moreover, you are constantly mistaken in addressing the supervisors.
One time you say “Mr.” and the second time you say “Comrade.”
I am not a boss for you, but a fellow chief.
Comrades are Comrades, Comrades are Comrades, Comrades are Comrades, Comrades are Comrades.
Please remember it!
I apologize, Sir ... Comrade Chief, but ... but I greeted you with the usual civic greeting.
There is nothing wrong with that ... and that is the honor of work, or comrade ... you know ... I am not on the side ...
"It's not your preference not to be on the side," said the chief coldly, who in the meantime calmed up a little.
But there will be talk about it.
Remember, you don’t have a seat in the upper seat for retirement.
It was not good.
When the boss told someone that something was not his preference, it didn’t look good with the person concerned.
For a moment he pierced me with a cold, stinking look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also upset by his advanced ticking.
He was only a few years older and played the Lord God, actually Comrade God.
Jovial, inflated, authoritarian, arrogant, as he was right now.
Everybody kicked him.
Yes, he is the boss.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, like all party members, but also non-partialists, ticked him.
But the chief touched many, especially those with whom he could exercise his superiority.
I just got caught up in total shit.
I thought something about the fuck and it cost me enough overwhelmingness not to shoot him into the knot.
But I’t even go back to the potato, let alone to continue to be a drill officer.
What would I do for two children?
And a broken house!
I was upset, but I controlled.
I will not make him happy.
“That’s all for now, you can go,” the chief ended the audition and began to look again carefully at the armor he had previously in his hand.
At half twelve I was called.
Everyone from the office was already there and, when asked what and how, they answered that yes, that it would be good.
Only Jožin cried out, as he used to say, that they could not drive us all out, because the work would have to be done by the comrade-in-chief himself with his faithful, and that there was no danger.
The word "comrade" was emphasized, as if he knew why the old man wiped me off in the morning.
There was a nice meeting at the headquarters.
Comrade Chief at his desk and at the long counseling table, other comrades who had to decide whether or not I would be an official.
Kádrovák, chairman of the ROH, rector of the personnel, referent for special purposes, something about how to counter the military, and deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the shell.
An ordinary railway worker, beating a barrel or throwing a spark with a fork.
And also a former buffalo.
It was said that there was no fun with him at the time, said a nice beast.
Bad languages claimed that he went out of school in the seventh grade, did not learn anything, did not know anything.
When the crime was cancelled, he ended up on a potato.
Comrade, the comrade was broken.
The boss told me to sit down.
There was a small soul in me, an unshakable sickle in my neck.
Kádrovák read the opinion from the citizen committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I am married, two children and so on and so on.
So far it’s fine, I thought, and I was breathing a little better.
A statement from the street party.
He copied the opinion from the citizen committee, probably both were written by the same person.
But then it came!
His parents, long-time party members, refused to appear before the review commission and subsequently withdrew from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The boss looked at me sharply.
The man noticed it and stopped reading.
The chief ordered him to continue.
Then it was only worse.
I was a member of the City Committee of the SSM and there I was recruited as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and I also had my wedding at the National Committee.
I disappointed the party in the worst way.
I was removed from the list of candidates.
But that wasn’t enough!
I baptized both of my children, and even my mother, when she died, had a church funeral, even though she was a former party member.
All this shows a negative attitude towards the leadership role of the party.
When the carpenter read, only the tapping of the headman’s pencil on the table disrupted the tense silence.
Everyone looked at me, and I wanted to be somewhere far away.
At the same time, I was constantly repeating in my mind, "Communists - supermen, Communists - supermen."
Why didn’t I stay with the carpenters?
I was able to repair the folders without any fake checks.
But now ?
She took her career as a railway officer before she began.
Return to the squad?
I don’t think it’s going to happen, I’m going to leave for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you check the comrade here?" the chief interrupted the tense silence with a question to the chief.
According to previous employment.
Do you have it here?
Obviously, it was not for the time being.
At the edges of the croupier, he sweated nervously, as if he himself had been examined.
He stumbled and handed a paper to the boss.
“No,” said the chief with a sign of cheerfulness, which, however, was often the precursor of a storm.
At first glance, the praise, taught with honors, graduated from industrial sciences, worked in a task salary as a locker, the norm was fulfilled on average at one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essential is missing.
Where did you get that opinion, comrade?” he turned again to the carpenter, who felt that it was somehow beginning to turn against him and that he’t have to be a carpenter very soon.
My friend gave it to me when I arrived.
Was it enough for you?
“Well, when he came to us, he went to the squad,” blunted the squadman.
And there the testimonials are not required, his was somehow extra, so I put him in the file.
"So when you were included in the technical function, this tsar of paper was enough," the chief said.
The man was nervous and had no response.
“It doesn’t matter, we’ll discuss it later,” the head of staff closed the matter and the manager seemed relieved.
So far it has survived.
“So what about you, comrade?” the boss turned to me again.
Suddenly I get rid of it, so it’s over!
My eyes were dull, I was hot.
It was followed by a tide of remorse and accusations, and I knew that I was the most disgusting creature in the world, not worthy of the slightest mercy.
That by underlining the incomplete assessment, I misled the comrade of staff, while I did not understand why the assessment was incomplete when I received it from the carpenter in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element who, at the time of the construction of real socialism, supports and even participates in religious obscurity.
That, yes, there was a lot of everything I had committed, or maybe I was still committing, and I quietly prayed that it would end.
Everything was no matter.
I didn’t care if I flew out of the mechanic’s position.
I didn’t care if they took my potatoes too.
This is work for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of a comrade-in-chief.
“That would be enough, Comrade Chief,” the party chairman suddenly answered and severely interrupted the chief’s Levites.
Here the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake he did!
He has already received his punishment.
Do not forget this, Comrade!
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to his side for a while!
In order to open up to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated bachelor spoke like a book.
Where did it get in it?
Is it so counted or paparazzi phrases from party training and meetings?
That is why this young fellow must also get a chance from us!
Prove that he has changed.
And who should give it to him, if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts for correction!
It is your party duty that no one can relieve you!
It is a party duty of all of us.
Here the comrade must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother not only punishes, but also loves.
When the president finished, nobody even looked.
No one expected such a turn of the situation.
At least me.
“I totally agree with you, Comrade President,” the chief of staff sneezed in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you let me agree, you would have heard that this is exactly the conclusion I’ve come to.
Everyone shrugged their heads, but it was seen that they didn’t believe him a word.
"So I was confirmed for the role of a standalone referent for basic funds care," I cried when I returned to the office and suddenly wept.
Everyone, except Eve, was at lunch.
She listened silently to my unconnected narrative of the fresh experiences and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I finished, she asked me if I could have coffee.
Without waiting for a response, she put water on the boiler and prepared cups.
In the meantime, she talked about clerical practices.
As one opinion, often full of praise, they give a man in the hand, and the other, in which there is some dirt, they send to the new employer.
But I did not end where I had to, but at the straw at the potato, so the comrades at the factory didn’t know where to send it.
And our carpenter?
He only cared about where he would eat or drink, and so it ended up as it ended up.
“That’s from the old man,” she remarked maliciously.
He won’t taste it today.
Be careful of him, he’s very aggressive.
The Party President?
In fact, a far worse boss, no humility.
Zero from a potato with great power.
The water for coffee began to boil, and immediately the office filled with the smell of just dried coffee.
I threw a cubicle of sugar into the cup and silently mixed a hot beverage.
Maybe I’m out of the worst.
I’m not going to be fired and I’m not going to be fired until three years from now.
I will not forget that fellow chief today.
Published in the antology LITERÁTI NA TRATI II.
The symbol resurrected.
The wheel of the windshield over Chlumem turns again after years.
It can be seen from far away because it is located on a fifteen-meter-high stoog.
People in the surrounding area call him “The Wind of the Wind”.
For a village of 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the municipality received on the occasion of the congregation of natives in 2010.
"We asked for a sign and the windshield we wanted to have on the sign, of course, everyone knows it in the area," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit of a memento of the present: it reminds of the time when the people of the country fought for quality drinking water.
It was rare in the past centuries.
It was only in 1910 that the Chlumsky representatives decided on a solution, which then suited until the mid-1980s.
In the village, a seven-meter-deep well was dug.
Three years later, the well was supplemented with a metal structure with a wind pump that pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranic na Morave at a cost of SEK 2,400," the memorial inscription on the ground fence of the construction of the stool reads.
The pump after several repairs and falls of the wind wheel served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the water struggle began to be written: that day a new water pipeline began to serve in Chlumu.
The wind pump has only remained a non-functional municipal symbol and a rarity here.
They dominated this year’s family.
It was only in 2008 that the Chlumski decided to repair the wind wheel and put it back into operation.
They made a replica of the original wheel, reduced by half a meter in diameter.
The wheel was installed on the stool, but it had to be lifted down the same year.
The replica manufacturer did not choose a suitable material and the wheel could not resist the wind.
Then the Chlumska dominanta for several years rested dismantled under the roof.
However, since June this year, the bike on the high stojar has been rotating again.
On the occasion of the congregation of the natives, the town allowed the replica of the wheel to be modified and again placed on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel pulls utility water from the well only into the blind arm.
And over the summer we completely disconnected it because there was little water in the well.
At least it was empty.
"In autumn, we will disconnect the wind wheel axles from the pump in the sack basket again," explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the wind wheel has entered the municipality mark, but it is the only village of this kind in the whole of Vysočině.
A similar element in the sign is in honor of local technical monuments such as in Chvalkovice and Zelené Hory in Vyškovsk, in Kuželovo in Hodonínsk, Partutovic in Přerovsk or in Polica in Vsetínsk.
Nothing wrong, but I don’t know Lafata, admitted Tripoli’s Goian.
“I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal, like all in my career,” Goian, 34, smiled at the pre-match press conference.
At the time, Georghe Hagi trained us, it was a pity that we lost.
Hopefully I’ll give a goal to Sparta.
Only with the difference that we won’t lose this time,” Goian continued.
This man, who has played 60 matches for the Romanian national team, is the key support for the Greek team.
As a stopper, he will face the invasions of the Sparta offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says the Spartan Hybs about the Greek duel.
He has no idea what will happen on Thursday night.
I know Fataie well, who played in Astra, Romania, with my brother Lucian.
I watched all their matches.
“I know he’s a very good attacker, so he went to Sparta too,” Goian said.
He did not name the other footballers of the Prague club, so the direct question arose whether he also knows David Lafatu, the best shooter in the history of the Czech league and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and looked at the Czech journalists with a slightly reproachable look.
An expression in his face meant, “Why are you asking me this?”
After a moment, he silenced.
We watched some videos and I noticed that Sparta is playing a lot in a team.
He has really good players.
And Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don’t know anyone other than Fataia.
The Spartans know this very well about Goian.
"He has experience from larger clubs, it can be said that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is such their organizer of the game," Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal said.
Goian already has the best years behind, but he can boast of a very interesting football biography.
In his time, he was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, but from Steauy he went to Palermo, Italy, and played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We expect an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European Cups, winning the Czech league.
For me, he is a favorite in this match, but we are playing at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in peace with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is looking forward to the Czech opponent.
I too .
But for the whole team, I can say we will fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic and is considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should be in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for the purpose of trading the company’s shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have a headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far within the framework of the project are mostly legal and administrative and have no actual impact on the events in the company, says Daniel Buryš, financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the move of the headquarters of the Group, shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
In order to enter the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is completing the prospectus of the securities, which will be submitted to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding’s headquarters and related transfer of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction involving only existing shareholders.
As part of this transaction, no shares will be offered to the public or new investors.
"A possible offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders decide to do so - later, either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has previously stated that a possible offer of shares could consist of the issuance of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of offering shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including placement of shares on the Warsaw stock exchange.
The objectivity of Czech television in reporting on the migration crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the reporting of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time it is broadcast by Czech TV.
How did she survive?
When they will be teaching at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can let the Czech television broadcast Events.
About 80% of news broadcasts were devoted to the migration crisis.
Only in the first minute, when the Communist Party informed about the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and called the attacks of migrants on police officers euphemistically did their patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal bars), the current promigrant propaganda - judge the names of individual reports.
Criticism of non-governmental organizations – great space for non-profit organizations that criticize the ill-treatment of migrants.

The term “refugees” is used consistently as refugees and not as migrants.
Surprisingly, it is mainly the fact that the CT in illustration images consistently uses only and only images of small children and women.
At the same time, she said in the same broadcast that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda that has no precedent from communist agitatives.
As a journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in Practice.
When I once moved to a panel apartment, I soon ceased to be the only inhabitant.
I moved fish to the bathroom.
Domestic fishes, insects with an imperfect transformation, i.e., unproducing the transition from a hose to a broom and young looks like an adult individual, but is small and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me and I didn’t let them go.
First manually and then chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some kind of blue crystals for their elimination.
It was called Cyclone B.
Or some other way?
However, it was successfully eliminated.
I did the same with the pharaohs.
A box with a kind of juvenalizer that the ants brought into the nest and he then did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I turned it off.
As time went by, insects became my object of admiration, and I became increasingly inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have learned from my life that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and that one pest can be replaced by another.
Truth in the case of fleas and squirrels, I’t be disappointed to worsen my karma by killing them.
In the new residence, we agreed with our partner that if we do not have fishes to go over the neck, let them eat the scabies of drowned skin, some invisible algae and the like.
Their peaceful existence was interrupted by a spider.
It was an ordinary type of carpenter that had long been on the ceiling.
We thought it lived from occasional mosquitoes and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Since he lived in our country for several years, we found that he mostly eats fish and that he kept their numbers on a supportive level.
Through confidential, regular contact at every required time, we found out that it was a female.
We witnessed romantic conversations with a partner about one-third smaller, as carefully brushing on the spider’s fiber so that it wasn’t eaten before it reached the desired coupling.
It took about three days when they didn’t move and didn’t even react to our checks.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love games took place, we later found the remains of a dried male next to the female.
The spider did not move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of small spiders hanging around her.
They soon disappeared.
They were eaten by their mother, and they fled somewhere else.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she went elsewhere or died, we do not know, but after a month, two, she appeared again on the ceiling.
Probably one of the youngest girls in the bathroom.
For some time she watched our behavior cautiously from the ceiling and, moving under the toilet bowl, evaluated our non-attack as friendship.
The number of somewhat multiplied fishes decreased, and the spider looked at his normal activities to secure food.
Our ecosystem has not changed for a whole year.
Our daughter, meanwhile, has reached an age when wearing a nightwear was already a shame.
We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal spilling of its content has already become of interest to us.
We are increasingly encouraged to use the toilet.
But her daughter found an excuse for keeping her bad habit in the spider she saw very well when she wiped.
Our talk about seeing a spider, happiness in the house hasn’t taken at all.
With crying and screaming, she forced her nightmare.
There was no rest.
There was a time when the spider had to command, in the interest of the evolutionary shift of the daughter.
It is left to me.
He was caught in a glass and dropped over the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but after such a long coexistence I felt disgusting, as if I were throwing out a relative.
We assumed that the frogs would start to appear more frequently and begin to multiply by a geometric row.
A week or two, no one was there.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I wondered if the spider did not cultivate them there in the form of ants, that the bathroom environment was not as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first medium-sized pieces appeared, and they were already shrinking again.
I had to come up with a different theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I came to the conclusion that their connection to the spider must have been caused by the fact that if they don’t see it, it’s hidden somewhere else and they’re in danger from anywhere.
Or, they had some telepathic connection with their predator, and his rapid disappearance in them provoked some alarm reaction.
I do not have any illusions about their sight.
They showed some light shyness, but that they would react to hand movements or fast movements, they did not.
My daughter goes to the toilet regularly.
She has forgotten the nightmare.
I just want to find a spider again.
I’m already sending my wishes to the ether and I hope they haven’t stunned me after that execution.
Otherwise, we would have to use the Cyclone B.
10 words by Albert Einstein that have enriched the world.
The words of a genius scientist from the last century will never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to dive so deeply into everything that the outcome was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the greatest scientists of all time.
He introduced his special and general theory of relativity, which to date best describes the universe in its giant proportion.
It is also not to be overlooked by his explanation of the photoeffect or the idea of quantum electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the very description and system of knowledge of popular relativity theory is so complicated for many that they prefer easy armistice for closer acquaintance.
However, it is not easy.
But it’t have been Albert Einstein if he didn’t have a brilliantly simplified explanation for this: A clock near your loved one seems like a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems like an hour – and that’s relativity.
I allowed myself to choose from his whole plea of famous quotes these ten that literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Universe and human stupidity.
I’m not so sure about the first one.
No number of attempts can ever prove that I was right.
It is the only one who can prove that I was wrong.
It is a sad time when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in the mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don’t know what will be fought in World War III, but in World War IV it will be fought with sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but none to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing much is dangerous.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem on which my life would depend, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax.
In conclusion, I can’t forgive myself not to mention Einstein’s formula on the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A = X + Y + Z, where X is work, Y is rest and Z is to hold your tongue behind your teeth.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín region are waiting for changes for 1.5 billion.
"It's a success when we consider that all four hold in black numbers this year," he said.
The total profit of the district facilities is currently around 32 million crowns.
This is mainly due to higher payments from insurance companies, which are equally favorable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after years of poverty, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherský Hradišti and Zlín, thanks to this, buildings will be built, which together will cost almost SEK 1.5 billion.
The long period when we were mostly buying equipment has ended.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, high-quality healthcare can not be done, said Lubomír Nečas, deputy deputy minister for healthcare.
Changes are expected in all hospitals.
They will be in the hospitals next year.
In Vsetíně now select suppliers of the new internal pavilion for almost 300 million crowns.
There is a planned construction of a dialysis facility.
Uherské Hradiště wants to build a new intern for approximately 200 million to the central pavilion open this year.
And the Zlín Baťova Hospital is waiting for a long-delayed construction of a new central revenue and internship, which will need three quarters of billions.
In all cases, these are the major and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," said Věra Prousková, director of the hospital.
The five-storey building is expected to be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable facilities for intern and neurology, dialysis, a new ambulance, a bed and an intensive care unit.
Increased comfort for patients.
The changes, which are especially noticeable to patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many sick people lie in one room, on the ground floor they have only one toilet, the beds are unlockable, the windows are not tight and health workers do not have the appropriate conditions for work.
"For example, our internship was built thirty-five years ago and is now on the verge of its lifetime," said Pavel Calábek, director of Zlin Hospital.
In a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected with an urgent income.
Doctors and patients will have all emergency departments in one place, in addition to the new premises.
The same model already has half-finished Uherské Hradiště.
The central income is already in place and within three years it will be added internally.
"We will pay the construction from credit and partly from our own funds," explained director Petr Sládek.
It is the only hospital in the country that can afford its own funding.
The profit is still the highest and has not lost even two years ago, when the Zlinsky hospital faced a loss of almost two hundred million.
“We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, increased revenue and efficiently managed costs throughout the hospital,” said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
There will also be improvements for patients in the hospital.
In 10 to 15 years, up to half a billion crowns will be spent on repairs, new devices and reconstruction.
This year, the repair of the rescue station will be completed, then the construction of dialysis will begin, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one explained to me how I should keep accepted refugees in the country when they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) after talks with his European colleagues complains that other states are pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but refuse any discussion.
He also noted that no one has explained to him how he should keep allocated refugees in the Czech Republic when they do not want to live with us.
"We did not receive a response, so we wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position with which you came at the meeting of the Ministers of Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We disagree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We cannot talk about migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have some visions, some direction, some relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we can keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were to be redistributed.
We cannot imagine it.
We did not receive a response, so we wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text.
With the other conclusions – functional hotspots, i.e. checkpoints, border protection, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We have been talking about this for a year and we say that this is the way.
Do you think quotas will solve everything?
In the past, it was 40,000, now it is 20,000.
When will it be 500,000?
How will we keep those people in the country?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who cross through us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants us, we just don’t know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country have ambitions to come to us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is limitally close to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees don’t even want to come to us, but we have already committed to accepting fifteen hundred people.
Could there be more on this path?
We pledged to accept 1500 people, but with a condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
At the same time, 1,100 refugees are expected to come to settle their asylum procedures.
They will come to our detention facilities and we will treat them just as we treat those we have captured.
It is a big question, and we will discuss it with Europe, whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and in Greece, possibly in Hungary.
Because Europe is behaving in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement, which is not yet, it may happen that we will not hold those 1100 on the territory of the Czech Republic and they will go back to that Germany after arrival.
If we are able to detain them during the asylum procedure, we will arrange an asylum procedure with them.
If they are citizens of Syria and Eritrea, almost 98 percent of them, according to European statistics, receive international protection.
They will then get documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will be relocated.
This is the second project that is underway so far, and we have only progressed there in discussing with the churches the possibility that they could help them find employment, accommodation, and so on.
But this is a race on a very long track.
You said that the other countries were not willing to discuss with us at the talks of ministers.
Is it not that the Czech Republic just rejects quotas, but does not offer any solidarity step that would unblock the discussion?
What do you think is a solidarity approach?
If the Federal Republic of Germany expresses an incentive that all Syrian migrants can come to them, the news will spread in hours across all camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
This will trigger another wave of migration that is heading to Germany because they simply don’t want us.
We think the way is to protect the external borders – simply to discourage those migration waves, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
To show them that they have no chance.
Only last year, 50,000 Kosovars arrived in Germany.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutors.
If we succeeded in separating them and not accepting them, or accepting them only according to the needs of the economies, then the fifty percent of what the social systems today in vain spend on them could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it’s eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How do we get tougher controls at the borders?
We were afraid of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred vacant places in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we detain will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We do it standard.
The Austrians are the only ones who take those people from us, with Hungary it’s complicated and the Greeks – it’s a completely useless story.
Where is the point of break?
Should it be a thousand a day?
I think it should be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three days in a row, will exhaust our capacity enough to set up crisis plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately summon an emergency government.
He is very interested in the whole matter, we are in telephone contact several times a day.
If the situation arises, the government can meet de facto immediately and, by one resolution, decide on strengthening the police with the army, let’s say the customs administration, or the prison service.
The ultimate option is the state of emergency that has now been declared in some places by Hungary?
I don’t think it can go so far to us.
Be aware that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen in order for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread alarming information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
This would affect the Czech Republic very marginally, almost at all.
The company paid off a large portion of its debt at the last minute.
This prevents the declaration of bankruptcy.
The soccer team has paid off debts.
Football players also get their money.
Football Slavia appeared in court on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings.
Nearly three months after the proposal was filed by Online Services from Pacific Samoa for approximately SEK 20 million.
Slavia’s lawyer Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzl in a matter of hours that she had no intention of declaring her bankruptcy.
I have to say that he had the arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week the new owner of Slavia became the large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also Czech billionaire Jiří Šimane.
Evidently, the money came from the new owners to the club, at the last moment.
This is also evidenced by Slavia’s statement before Tuesday’s court hearing – the club on Monday, just a day before the court hearing, sent the debtors tens of millions of crowns.
"Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15," the lawyer Slavie Mládková said.
To whom did Slavia pay?
current and former business partners.
Specifically, the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan and the Czech defender Mario Ličko.
Slavia also paid the fee to agent Alexander Losenick.
On Friday, the club also paid the debt fees of the city of Prague 10.
In the case of insolvency, de facto only claims that Slavia contradicts remain part of the insolvency dispute.
According to the club, either the obligations did not arise at all, or there are legal disputes over them.
However, we are prepared to pay the amount in the event of the loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in the bank account, which we can prove by a statement from the account," lawyer Mládková told the judge.
"Everything that was due is paid," Mládková said, adding that only insolvent or disputed obligations are not paid.
The judge will not make a decision in the coming days and the trial will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid the debts.
All evidence will then be evaluated.
A decision can be expected as early as November.
The judge ordered the hearing to continue on November 3.
The decision will not be made at the meeting, but only in writing.

The combination of state-of-the-art technology, hardware and software equipment integrated into the modular design brings benefits and quick return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Anything, from welding structural steel to welding special alloys, as well as from welding rough materials to welding thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in shipyards.
The incredible number of welding curves, simple setup and scalability of the welding source allow you to react quickly to changing requirements, leading to reduced downtime, the need to rebuild the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with advanced welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and quality of welding.
It stops wasting time and there is no waste of material or repair of faulty welds.
Flexibility is ensured, there are fewer stops, more welding and higher profit.
This year’s show premiered in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We appreciate these honors very much, as they confirm the exceptionality of the product.
The world’s leading manufacturers can boast similar systems, but thanks to the differences in software and parameter management, FastMig X is among the world’s leading.
There are also good delivery times, which are about three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts, which will definitely expand after the Brno Fair.
We have been its regular participants for over twenty years and almost always our business results are better than before it, says Miroslav Streichsbier, head of the Kemppi store in Plzeň for ARC-H.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
White was built so that it didn’t break down.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
It could be safer, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built in such a way that two landslides did not occur in Stromovce, according to the manufacturing director of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovič.
He said this on Wednesday evening during a journalist’s inspection of the tunnel.
It would cost about half a billion crowns more.
It opens for drivers on Saturday afternoon.
There is always a compromise between price and security.
“The tunnel was safer, but costs are rising exponentially,” Butovic said.
The conditions in Stromovce were the same all the time, but the land fell just a few steps away from where it began to hit by a safer and more cautious method.
"If the measures were applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," Butovich said.
The tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was formed in Stromovce, and in 2010 the land fell near the Ministry of Culture in Prague.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří Bělohlava, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told Euro.
The project was originally planned to cost SEK 17 billion.
If we add to this VAT, which has jumped twice during the construction period, you have twenty-one out of seventeen billion.
When technology, land purchases and engineering activities, valorization and similar items are included, it is 29 billion, which is not so far from those 37 again, Bělohlav said.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to Get a New iPhone Operating System with the New Apple Update
A new operating system may be requested in Settings when you click the "General" tab and select "Software Update" (software update).
When it’s ready, it will offer you your phone the option to download and then install it.
Some users have encountered a post-installation problem, namely the "software update failed" error message.
One solution to this problem is to wait until an interest in the update falls, or try it through iTunes.
The phone will guide you through the update process.
And that includes the need to uninstall apps to free up space – but this won’t be necessary because Apple has shrunk the update and also made the whole process easier thanks to the use of a special tool that suggests the user to delete the apps and reinstall after the update ends.
Make sure your phone is charged before you start the update.
If the battery condition is low, Apple will not allow the update to run because disruption of the process could cause an update error.
Other news: release of iOS 9 was not delayed, despite the delay of WatchOS; review of iOS 9: an exciting update of the new version of the operating system; iOS9: how to prepare for the release of the new operating system for iPhone
Be sure to check out our list of things to do before upgrading, what to try and what to avoid or protect yourself from. iOS 9 will introduce new features, including an even smarter personal assistant and a wide range of creative iPad features, as well as many patches to speed up and repair the operating system.
FedEx Mixed Profits, Reduced Fiscal Outlook for 2016
FedEx unsatisfactory last quarter results and a huge decrease in its year-round profit forecast due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s shares fell by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, a drop of 20 cents from its previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an average 4.9 percent increase in interest rates, which will be reflected in January 4, and higher surcharges for land transportation of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth over the previous year due to cost cuts, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
Fred Smith, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, said the company “showed solid performance despite weaker than expected economic conditions, in the manufacturing industry and global trade.”
The vacation hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, which is roughly the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
Profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the results of the ground-based unit of FedEx.
Land revenues grew by 29 percent in the last quarter, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher base rates, while profits fell in freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-market trading about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decline of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record of 11 June.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, the Federal Reserve legislators will spend two days this week sitting at a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table and deciding whether it’s time to raise a key interest rate after a decade.
Tying above them at one end of the central bank ornament, the two-storey meeting room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have to put the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have recognized that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be an X-factor too close to a predictable decision to be announced on Thursday on whether the U.S. economy is ready to kick off with a retreat from an unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rates on the spot from the end of 2008.
Although most data shows solid growth in the economy, recent turbulences in the global financial markets could already scare the cautious Fed for adding to volatility by raising its federal fund reference rate – even by no more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"It's clear that the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch first," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think they’re just looking for an excuse to not raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait further,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which itself is a cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently polled by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to delay the matter, with the key indicator only about 30% chance of rising.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises interest rates, only if politicians soften the downturn by promising that further increases are in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16.599.85.
The assembly was launched by the expectation that Fed politicians will delay interest rates this week in calm, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the Fed raised interest rates now,” he said.
If the Fed politicians did, “they would have to go to the extreme in their program statement and hold the financial markets in hand to avoid panic.”
Other experts said the rate hike would calm the financial markets, as it would remove the uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of currency conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
Yellen said she expects rates to rise this year over the spring and early summer despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of rise.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank’s annual 2% target, Fed politicians say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to collapse at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped up to 16 percent below its record value in May, as investors feared the slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has somewhat rebounded this month and the Dow is now losing only 10% of the May high.
For Fed politicians, the troubled market situation provides a comprehensive calculation of when to start raising interest rates.
“In the absence of what has happened to the financial markets, and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what impact it will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s main interests, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the global currency authority.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “strangle” their monetary expansion in the market has triggered cramps around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly closely interconnected, Fed leaders are expected to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better understand the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth-management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that “The Fed has a history of exaggerated with movements in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic foundations.”
Lacker, a voting policy maker of the Federal Open Market Committee who pushed for rates to rise, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Fed to reduce its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during three sessions "Despite the limited identifiable impacts on U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed reversed these cuts.
The Fed should only prioritize financial stability concerns during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the interest rate committee at the Bank of England.
The latest outbreak is not even approaching this level, he said.
“You don’t want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because the markets are upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don’t think they should get to the top.

Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, this is the Chinese Quarter, not the Thai Quarter.
Market/Storage is the only point of contact offering a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There is even a car part available if you need a little motor oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour to cross all the streets.
If you are hungry for all that shopping, go for a meal at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various pick-up points.
What’s in stock: Do you need something – anything – Thai?
You will probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and a lot of items are sold wholesale.
Meanwhile, fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The extension of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash you and scratch you, even you will bake it if you want it,
A good portion of the store is left to a massive freezing compartment where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, free-selling semi-products and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as separate families and individuals.
Large streets run in front of shopping carts and high-lift trucks.
Finding: Fresh monthong durian next to the treasury stand.
Where: The store is in the industrial district of Los Angeles, surrounding the suburbs of the Chinese Quarter and the center - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking space, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be busy, parking usually isn’t hard to find.
The speed on the highways will remain the same.
Acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected.
On selected sections of the highways, it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed up to 150 km/h under favorable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House adopted an amendment by the Senate, which rejected the increase in speed.
The new law will now go to the President.
President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that he would veto the law allowing 100km speed.
Minister of Transport Dan Ťok (for ANO) was against the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built for such a speed.
On Tuesday, the Senate voted in favour of the bill.
The approved amendment will now allow, in accordance with the original government proposal, to increase the speed from 90 to 110 kilometers per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-stream roads.
The House initially extended this option to the highways, which could be used in selected sections with speeds up to 150 km/h, but the Senate rejected it.
Members have now agreed to his proposal.
The Senators, with the approval of the Minister of Transport, also removed the authority of the traffic police to have the last word in the modification of local roads, which are cared for by the municipalities.
The Senate version, which was approved by the House, also envisages that sewage, water pipes or public lighting cables can be placed along the road surface.
The municipalities would save money by buying land.
Municipalities should also not have the obligation to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the respective land.
The novel also aims to help improve the protection of roads and make it easier for municipalities to handle removed vehicles that are not registered by owners.
In addition, municipalities will be able to sell removed vehicles for which their owners will not register within a six-month period after the notice of removal.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight traffic across their territory on second and third-class roads under the threat of fines for shipping companies.
The new law also eliminates the possibility of introducing electronic highway signs instead of the previous paper signs, which will be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of the electronic system.
The expressionist goes to court.
He was sentenced to 10 years for welcoming the citizens.
The case relates to the allegedly overpriced Citizens welcome project.
The police wanted to prosecute the MP Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD) in this case, but the House of Representatives did not issue her.
Depending on the legal qualification of the case, both are facing up to 10 years in prison.
The trial is scheduled for two days in October.
According to the prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused damage of at least one million crowns, according to the indictment.
The plaintiff is based on an expert opinion.
According to the plaintiff, the former members of the city’s management, on behalf of their duties, unlawfully allowed to obtain the property benefit of the company that organized the welcoming of citizens.
According to the indictment, Mandik ordered the then chief of the magistrate department of urban services, education and culture to address five connected companies in the competition.
When another company that offered the lowest price entered the competition, the municipality cancelled the competition.
The contract was then entrusted to the administrator by the city, and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid a million more.
Both defendants, aimed at ensuring the award of a public contract for Darothore to organize the Citizens’ Welcome event in Ústí nad Labem, acted in a long and coordinated manner, at least contrary to the requirement for a procedure with the care of a regular farmer, the prosecutor wrote.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that Darothore subsequently, after obtaining this contract, charges Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcome Citizens event a price that will be disproportionately increased against the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company has collected more than five million crowns for the project.
The city eventually paid only one portion, approximately SEK 1.7 million, then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert assessment, the amount paid was overpriced by at least one million crowns.
He has previously denied any violation of the law.
I have not committed any crime, I am innocent.
I don’t understand this planned case, the former mayor said earlier with the fact that the city under his leadership has only been linked to a similar project from past years.
The event was organized by Roxy II between 2008 and 2010.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mandík added.
Criminalists originally wanted to charge Kailova, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the parliament did not issue her to prosecution.
Criminalists have therefore postponed the case, but expect Kail to be charged after her parliamentary term ends.
The welcoming of citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
The mothers received a gift cheque of 5 thousand crowns for the purchase of children’s supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police arrested a refugee dog.
Then they forced journalists to delete the record.
Hungarian policely briefly detained an AP cameraman on the border with Serbia and forced him to delete a record on which a police dog allegedly hit a refugee.
The Hungarian government has denied this accusation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday evening when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing a cornfield near the Hungarian city of Röszke across the border with Serbia.
Police intervened against the refugees and one of them allowed a certain Syrian to attack a dog with a basket on a cushion.
The dog of the man who shouted, “Please, I’m a refugee,” stumbled, says Muzi.
One of the officers noticed that Muzi was filming everything and did not let him leave.
The journalist was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Police took Muzi to a dark spot near the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
He was then ordered to remove the record.
This was the result of two days of work in Serbia and Hungary.
He said he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP agency sent a protest letter to the Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
She called the behavior of police officers unacceptable and said journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not having to fear that the government will destroy legally acquired material.
Kovács, referring to the police report, questioned Muzi's hearing of the events.
He said the policemen just wanted a reporter to show them if they were on some of the footage, which they said they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren’t there, they didn’t force him to do anything.
"Dogs can lick - they are trained to deter and a little hunt for fear, but they don't attack with certainty," Kovács says.
Unpredictable Champions League.
City will win, says Juventus
“It’s a disappointment, I don’t think we deserved to lose,” headlined Manchester City coach Manuel Pellegrini.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
None of the teams created a lot of opportunities, but we had the ball on the pitches longer.
"The reason for the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team raced in a competitive match after a long 636 minutes.
The finalist of last season Juventus was exactly the opposite before the mutual encounter - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, he has as a title defender only a point and with a score of 2:4 he is only in the 16th place of the table.
The turn to Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supports before the new year - Pirlo, Tévez and Vidal.
In Manchester they were represented by Pogba, Mandžukić and Morata.
"It's so, this victory is terribly important, maybe thanks to it we'll go to the wave of victory," Morata hopes.
Because when we are there, we are among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the offensive.
My players deserve this.
“Before our match, we could have scored 0:2, but Gianluigi kept us,” Allegri coach Buffon praised.
“We burned a few good chances,” said Yayu Touré, City backer.
We have to take the Champions League experience and try to do better next time.
Goodbye Angelo, Goodbye Old Germany II.
Before we go on to the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all that media crackling around is driven by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also above.
Let us stop for a moment.
Today, newspapers and the media are full of children carried by their parents on the dusty roads of exodus.
And this automatically gives rise to feelings of guilt and compassion in man—that is, in the European man.
Well, they are not just desperate children coming here, notice on the images of boats landing to the Greek islands that children are not so much to see on them!
Well, somehow, recently, images of ships headed to Lampedusa disappeared from our television, refugees from the French border near Menton, on whose beautiful promenade thousands of young men lie down.
Mostly young black people.
And also the pictures of Callais disappeared, where these people eat and black men wait to see if they can cross the tunnel under the Channel.
Probably no longer matters.
Even the images of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans did not in any way make a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
There was too much falsehood.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it is somehow hidden that it is not just about unhappy children from Syria, but also about exhibited - for the elderly: fashionably featured - young men.
Their muscles look like they just got out of a fitness center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer in the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we were lying on a private hotel beach.
Despite being private, a large group of cars suddenly came to the beach.
No shakes though.
The young black men came out.
Thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They entered the beach, all dressed in branded clothes and shoes.
That it was a private beach didn’t interest them and the staff – Turks, Muslims! – obviously feared them.
They occupied all the beds.
Those who didn’t go to the sea had a bad luck.
He was dressed like a rapper.
On the heads a hat with a nail, white and colored adidas on the legs.
Then they besieged the local beach bar and began to feed.
They occupied the tables around, climbing up to the sides of the bar’s eaten and white guests – reading to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace somewhere to peace.
The incoming blacks drank beer straight from a third – like in the US TV series?! – throwing empty bottles around on the beach.
They cried out loudly to each other.
In English it was not.
Then they went to drink wine, also straight out of the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool – in branded swimsuits, especially the young ladies – in the water they yelled and screamed, mothers with children and retirees escaped terrifyingly, and in half an hour there was no one black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They all disappeared.
Whether you are a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about them.
The waiter said to me in the evening, “Did you see the gold they were wearing?”
“Yes,” I said.
“They didn’t have it,” said the waitress.
I remembered, “I know, everyone had massive golden chains around their necks.
One of them had a 20-centimeter massive gold cross on his neck.
Women are like gold.
“Are they drug smugglers?” I asked.
“You’ve seen them cuddle,” the waitress said.
They don’t use drugs and don’t use them.
They are smuggling something completely different.
I knew what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105, it wasn’t so important to me.
I did not know what would follow.
But the secret services and top politicians should know this first.
I don’t think they didn’t know.
About 1.5 million migrants arrived in Europe at the time.
They go and they go and they go.
Today it turns out that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-politically-correct politicians, such as intellectuals and their associated lobbying and economically important groups, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians – now publicly recognized as the main force in Europe – are lying, lying and lying – but not only they, but the leaders of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television footage of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany is at the level of the Moscow television footage of August 1968.
Sure, there were a few sunshine workers at the station, but mainly - the old German - Muslims welcomed their nicknames.
For many weeks, the Czech television that, according to some research, the Germans are almost all in favor of the arrival of emigrants.
Anyone who has only been in Germany for a few days knows that this is a lie like a tower.
This confirms further information.
For example, the famous opinion poll organized by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept more refugees a week ago.
This was also by our television.
But they hid what broke out in Germany the next day: that in the poll voting on the article it turned out that 94.5% of Germans no longer want any immigrants - the poll involved 67,000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, five years ago: “Our quest for a ‘multiculture’ society has totally failed.”
She said: “Germany is giving up the struggle for a multicultural society.”
“Every attempt at such a coexistence has failed.”
In a country of four million Muslims, she said, there was no strategy that allowed people from different cultures to live side by side without integrating.
That is not reality.
The multicultural approach, when we say that we simply live happily next to each other, has failed.
Absolutely failed.
But even Merkel probably has no strength to go against the powerful of Germany and Europe and especially against political correctness.
This shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is growing rapidly.
Euro-German Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, MP for the SPD, the only one who is allegedly not even a graduate in the European Parliament - yes, this is the one that Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play a watchman in a concentric from a minute - has shown himself as many times.
It seems, especially under the impression of the recent statements of German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, except for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that were victims of Nazism are terrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who has tried for years, at least outwardly, to deal with their terrible past as an aggressor and killer of millions?
Do those who say that in the soul of Germany is the devil of aggression, superiority and violence?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he with all his strength stopped the attempts of the Great Germans to control the whole center of Europe?
When did he say that the great German idea would destroy Germany?
Probably had.
When it was removed, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Great Germany, which led Germany and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in a different form.
After the attempt by the Marxists to control the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany on the basis, for example, of ecology, which was by the way one of the main ideological teachings of Nazism.
I would say sunshine.
The German elites for a long time defended the emergence of German nationalism, so they left all those anti-atom fighters, enthusiasts looking for a paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi motto Our forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people who everywhere in the world want to do something different and better, they have fully bowed to the side of the fighters against global warming, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strong anti-Semitic – so-called pro-Palestinian – and anti-Slovak current in this current that considers all Slavs to be difficult to recruit – since the days of Karl Marx, who, after his parents Jewish, was mostly a German nationalist.
And also, as recent statements by Schulz and German ministers openly threatening disobedient Eastern states show, the idea of a leading Germany.
It must be listened to without hesitation.
Woe to you!
And when we mix the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind it, as always, is the capital, especially the German capital, to which it suits and which comes from the fact that Germany actually controls most of Europe through the banks and the Union.
The pseudo-faith of the sunshine makers first brought the Germans into the basins of ecology and multi-culturalism and today brought them home and will bring millions of Muslims.
Those who, beaten by the voices of the sirens, will soon hit the wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and begin to revolt.
Germany can only again threaten its neighbors with force, it can again ideologically slide down a portion of its population — but seemingly a smaller portion — but eventually the reality will catch it up as always.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim houses are burning.
What will the German government do when the public protests of the Germans against the coming Islamists break out?
Who will come to the aid of Muslims who have long lived in Germany but are not assimilated to take on local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans, looking with fear for the Islamization of their country, get involved?
What will it do with the Germans, and in general with Germany, when people rise up to protest loudly and publicly against the new euro-superhuman Muslim?
Germany has changed.
The conflict that has been provoked in Europe by the support of the sunshine ideology, the ideology of the elite and in principle totalitarian, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the unwavering behavior against the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient Eastern neighbors, it can’t go well.
Completion tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of the scammers is to scare them to death.
You just need to knock and the robust knock-on will blow you up in a way that the weaker nature may not just stand up.
A resurrected head will squeeze you and wipe you off, and a resurrected statue will accompany (or rather wipe out) a resurrected seller on the way away.
It may be a shame that a speaking whistle cannot be obtained in reality.
There would also be a lot of scams and scams.
Rose juice (Oxalis corniculata)
Small weeds that tolerate dry environments.
And so it is located among the outdoor tiles near my home.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which, although it belongs to the expansive weeds, appears to make a nice impression when it comes to flowering.
It is located between the outdoors.
It is very good, it works well in our garden.
She likes dry environments, is easily adaptable, modest and unpretentious.
Although it creates sheets with a chaotic composition, it is worth observing and continuing to photograph.
Underneath the glimpse is the beauty of the detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with a purple accompaniment.
Brazilian pediatric society Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet during breastfeeding
The Brazilian Pediatric Society SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women insight into the importance of a good diet during breastfeeding using images of babies sucking from a breast painted with images of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to excessive energy requirements, pregnant women and newly born mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic formation of their babies and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it has also been confirmed that unhealthy diets have a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise Dominates Rates, Despite Nine's Trying to Take Over Leadership in Today Show
Karla Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson’s departure to Canberry for covering the costs of leaking liberal leadership failed to create a sufficient rating increase for Today.
The morning show Nine screened from the national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage got stuck in London as part of a week-long international television series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls, and Cancun.
It did not seem that this tyranny of distance mattered so much to viewers of Aussie TV, as it recorded an average of 397,000 viewers in five capitals compared to 330,000 viewers of Today.
Today recorded a smaller increase in its rating compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was just behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today has filled the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, there were an average of 318,000 in Today compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers and Today has 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened in the whole morning.
The winds of change are affecting more this morning than just parliament, friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for choosing!

The great news for Seven was the stunning 800-word debut with former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children to the seaside part of New Zealand, has an average of very impressive 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself would be able to tighten the television hit without the star of the Rafters Rebeccy Gibney.
Last night’s result was a clear “yes”.
The X Factor by Seven retained a strong 1,136 million viewers, smoothly beating The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed audiences on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of Andrew O’Keefe’s new television quiz (from 5 p.m. to 5 p.m.) had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) reached 623,000 spectators — enough for a small victory over Hot Seat by Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators and the second half an incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the drop in the Chase Australia rating from the second night, the Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will eventually win at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuir's show.

Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but whom will he choose?
Secrets Revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly found out who will win the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is covered in an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who remain will definitely not reveal who is the real one who will eventually get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lany Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they ruthlessly told us who would win.
Sam Wood holds his tongue behind his teeth until Thursday's final
All three women lyrically praised why Wood was the perfect man, quoted his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
In any case, when asked, “If not, who will get Wood’s final flower?” their answers could act as spoilers about who will win Bachelor’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would fit Wood best in addition to them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a long relationship.
"From the moment I entered the house and observed the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
“Sarah is a really earthly woman, there’s a lot of fun with her,” Markoski added.
I’ve seen them together and there’s the chemistry between them.
They feel good and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood are a good couple.
For her, she claims that during his last visits home, she realized that Wood could be "the real one."
"Once I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game - I opened my whole heart to him now," he added.
I asked who Wood would choose, if not her, she looked mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say it,” she said.
I like the two girls equally – it’s unresolved between Snowden and Lana.
Bachalor is broadcast on Wednesday at 7.30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States and a lot of teams questioned about his great start to training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit down for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was made by an Australian rugby league converter at his first kick off the pitch at Tuesday's 20:3 win at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to get back and take him into play after injuring Reggie Bush.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing the newcomers before the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a post-match press conference.
The 49ers reporter, Cam Inman, said Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and only care about the next game.
During the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It wasn’t the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught in the hustle when he mistakenly left the field and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 a worse start to his career in the NFL he could not even imagine.
“It happens, you just focus on the next game and that’s all,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the trap to his original 2007 debut, when a recording in his own goal area led to the Queensland Trophy.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo of his fans holding the Australian flag on his Instagram account.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss homosexual rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested in a Siberian ranway.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts limited.
The U.S. stood by emigrants who demanded compensation for property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to the state with a request for compensation under the Act on extrajudicial rehabilitations.
The court first assigned them the requested amount, i.e. over SEK 2.8 million, but the Court of Appeal changed their claim so that they only granted less than SEK 90,000 with reference to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the pricing regulations of 1991.
The immigrants were arrested by the Supreme Court and paid the amount originally claimed.
The Ministry of Finance, which had to pay the money, turned to the USC with a complaint.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted according to the legislation in force at the time - although it was then an adequate compensation in relation to the removed property - today reaches only a fraction of the value of the property.
“This can’t go to the burden of secondary participants as in the restitution of entitled persons who have claimed their rights since at least 1995 and who had not had the possibility to obtain compensation earlier,” explained the judge rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, why the ÚS stood on the side of emigrants.
“The U.S. has repeatedly called for the general courts to proceed in restitution cases so that possible inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of the entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation is always achieved, i.e. compensation for property misconduct caused by acts of the previous totalitarian state,” the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studia DVA is now played by Radka Fišarová.
By the way, Radka Fišar became the world’s youngest Evita when she played the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech presentation of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Timeo Rice in the Prague Theatre Spirala in 1998.
To return to the same role, he says: "Today, Evita's difficulty has not been compared with the performance."
Evita is not only a wonderful role, it is also a responsibility.
Monika Absolon was nominated for the role of first lady of Argentina.
I’ve seen Monza in Evita three times and it definitely inspired me.
I suddenly found a completely new concept.
I am a supporter of the more modern modifications, but this one is successful.
“The director of Ondřeje Sokola is original, lightweight and contemporary,” says Fišar.
The musical handover between the two singers will take place at Monika Absolon’s Birthday Concert on September 27 from 19:00 in the Studio DVA Theatre.
The evening will feature musicals from the musical Evita.
The song will be featured in Don’t Cry For Me Argentina (Argentino).
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also take off from the director’s desk when he will represent Karla Rodena in the role of President Perón during the filming.
Due to public interest, additional dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is launched by Studio DVA in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
In Ondřeje Sokola, the main female role was originally studied by Monika Absolon.
On her side appears Karel Roden as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenáčik.
Legendary songs from the workshop of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech texts by Michael Prostějovsky sound in the presentation of a live orchestra under the direction of Kryštof Mark, who participated in the first release in the theater Spirála.
Four people killed after police fired rubber rockets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber rockets at a crowd of protesters against a draft new state constitution, a official said on Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district officer, said more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the police station and some were throwing stones and firearms.
Mr Dhakal reports that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, which are known for their killing ability but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
The clash was the last in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, mitigating their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which demands the creation of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted this week in Kathmandu on the provisions of the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We should not panic now.
After losing on the ice of the championship Litvínov, you did not manage a home match with the hockey players of Sparta (3:5).
Are you not worried about the same disastrous entry into the league as a year ago?
I hope nothing like this will happen again.
Congratulations people.
NHC predicts 60 percent probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A large low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent likelihood of a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system around the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles also has a 60 percent probability of a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, a Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has announced that it is launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European countries while fleeing war-torn and poor countries.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
Google employee Rita Masoud posted a post on her blog based on her personal experience when she fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old.
“We traveled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear,” Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families are willing to help.
All donations will be distributed among four non-profit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said it will double all posts made through google.com/refugeerelief to the amount of $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the biggest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them coming from Syria, devastated by the four-year war, which alone this year displaced 4 million people.
Many people are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be useful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether moderate obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
“Mortality data takes a long time to show,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote the introduction to the new JAMA surgery study.
Operations for weight loss, bariatric surgery use various methods to reduce the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the weight ratio related to height, is considered normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates an overweight person, and people above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, researchers from General Hospital Min-Sheng in Taiwan used data collected from a study since 2007 that deals with two types of bariatric surgery – stomach bypass and gastrectomy – in treatment procedures for type 3 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who did not receive surgical treatment for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the drug-treated group, for comparison, diabetes was solved completely in only 1 percent and partially only in about 2 percent of patients.
Furthermore, blood pressure, triglyceride and “bad” LDL cholesterol controls were shown to be “generally better in the surgical group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient’s hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflects the ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, researchers say.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the drug-treated group, however, this figure remained at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control” – which is reflected in better hemoglobin A1c levels – did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and were more likely to have diabetes remission (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While a new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to prolonged life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about 29 percent more chances of surviving in the next 15 years, compared to the group that tried more conventional methods.
Although a new study did not show any improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, this is a reassuring outcome for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Here this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a group with a lower BMI," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he states.
Blackstone also further argues that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after a patient’s BMI drops between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to show people the seriousness of the situation,” he says.
I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes that firmly link their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to accommodate all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is devoted to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that under current circumstances, the interests of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to resolve the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring true peace and real development, especially through education to these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Addressing issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the charges against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, arguing that “the violent US response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not by violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have consumed a sanitary agent in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States a 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed a high-alcoholic sanitary agent, according to the Toxicology Center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Toxicology Center, the number of ingests of sanitary devices in children under 12 years of age at poison control centers has increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are getting to these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to an emergency,” Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitation deliberately, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking a sanitary product because of a cheap whistle.
The teenagers allegedly mixed a sanitary with a mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the remedy.
“Children don’t think it could hurt them,” Lopez said.
Many more attractive (sanitary) products are those that are perfumed.
Sanitary products with the smell of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges are very attractive for children.
The sanitation product contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Particularly in young children, several curls can indicate alcohol poisoning.
“It’s a highly concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Toxicology Control Center at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You’t just let a glass of whiskey go, but people leave these sanitary devices outside and when children get to them, it’s a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed up to four bowls of a strawberry-smelling sanitary agent at school, was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who cared for her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah spoke unclear words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, as the girl fell down and struck herself in the head because of alcohol, Ritchey says.
“It was very scary,” said Ortoria Scott, the mother of Nhaijah, to CNN.
It could be fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or arrange to keep sanitary equipment out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitary devices were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a sanitary device containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Medical practitioners believed that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth grade students in northern New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by spreading antibacterial products around the room," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary equipment and has banned their presence in the room.
The police described the shattered plan as “innocent pushing,” referring to the discipline of the school district.
No disagreement in Celtic team
Griffiths underestimates Celtic discord speeches, while Deila admits Hoops are in the wrong place, but he turns it back again.
Hearts will fight with the SFA against an attack on Neilson, and Warburton has fears that new January reinforcements will disrupt the team’s unity.
Dons increase their lead to Celtic by 5 points
The penalt of the first half in the presentation of ADAMA Rooney secured Aberdeen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, thanks to which they gained the Dons a five-point advance between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths denies discord
This situation has sparked gossip about disagreement in Celtic, which has been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for a match with the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don’t think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack in Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers defender and former Dutch national Ronald de Boer says Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them over the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax ambassador, said: “The Netherlands no longer shows the best of Celtic matches, and why?”
There are no Rangers anymore.
It’s not just about the return of the Rangers.
Talk about the old company.
They’re talking about both teams together and that’s what they’re interested in.
There is great tension at the Old Firm matches and not only people from Scotland watch these games.
I turn things back to the good, Deila commits.
ROONY Dealia has admitted that Celtic is a bit cluttered, but the Norwegian boss has pledged to turn things back to good.
Malm’s defeat and subsequent loss from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now reaches the top of the table with a five-point advance.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already experienced bad times and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about what’s happening.
We are the same, but we have to go on.
Indeed, we really need support from Celtic because it makes the players much better.
It is very important to stay with each other.
Warburton worries about January reinforcements
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago suggesting that he has already identified some of his January goals, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is concerned about big boost shopping and insists he doesn’t want to disrupt the team’s unity from Ibrox.
Former Brentford chief states: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer one.”
The players who come in the summer have an entire pre-season season to accommodate, which you could have seen on our own team this season.
This goes really well.
Sometimes more damage occurs by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Celtic Michu's transfer goal indicates retirement
Swansea Michu, who was linked to Celtic in the transfer window, suggested he could retire with Swansea after his contract expires.
The twenty-year-old has had problems with an inclined ankle for two years and was unable to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight with SFA over comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2–1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and eventually lost 3–2, but the red card on this defender was later revoked – this was the third red card issued by referee Collum that was revoked.
Neilson stands behind his claim, stating, “I didn’t question integrity, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths pledged to avoid Tynecastle
Hibbe was severely punished after he admitted he was singing a song with a text aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
“It was a derby and it was a hard moment,” the attacker said and continued, “I can safely say I won’t go back to Tynecastle unless it’s in the Celtic dress.”
Tannadice Council Believes in Dundee United - Donelly Management
Simon Donelly insists that the board of Dundee United still believes in fixing the situation by the current management of the team - but admits that the downturn on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the boys for action again,” promises Donnelly.
McInnes is pleased for a "ugly victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to desperately hold on to Hamilton Accies in order to win their seventh league victory in a row and a five-point lead to Celtic at the top of the table thanks to the first half penalty in Adam Rooney’s presentation.
McInnes states, “There is no team that has won anything, whether cups or leagues, without winning this type of matches.”
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged while overall UK unemployment rises
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in the period from May to July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above the UK rate of 5.5 percent, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland decreased by 12,000 over a three-month period, and the number of working people has now stopped at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell said in commenting on the latest figures: "The long-term government plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It’s been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, we witnessed further improvement in the labour market and Scottish employment grew while unemployment declined.
Why I witnessed an Oklahoma Execution
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will watch the killing of a man.
If that happens, and I hope that doesn’t happen, I’ll sit in the viewing gallery in the Oklahoma State Prison Death Chamber and see Richard Glossip being executed by a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who will witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I start to get scared.
So why do I do it?
I accepted this invitation because I think it is a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would give me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more applications than vacancies, a morbid lottery is being held to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of posts for journalists from 12 to 5.
Whosoever is chosen will watch the entire execution uninterestingly.
I cannot do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends and have created a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that boy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison administration says I can’t be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won’t be allowed a notebook and I won’t be able to record what I see.
I will have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the behavior as he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that “she could have formulated it better,” but she still thinks what I’m doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and even if he did, I’t listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
He wants an international journalist who is ready to tell the story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the proceedings against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post reporter, will be by my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I will not repeat all the details here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of complicity in a crime.
There is a high probability that he is innocent of the murder.
I firmly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think the execution is bad.
It is from this perspective that I will observe his death.
I can’t say I’m really objective.
You can contact other journalists for this purpose.
What you will get from me is the experience of seeing a person I love die of unnecessary death.
Man escapes from Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after rescuing a man from Canning River.
Peter’s man’s bet that he would run away from the police didn’t come out after he got into the shallow muddy water just meters away from a policeman who tried to persuade him nonviolently to return to the shore.
Canning Vale police were summoned during an incident crossing into Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he did not get far.
“He stood in the water and repeated, ‘I won’t go out, just come for me,’” said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Police officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn’t want to squeeze his uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic – police negotiations.”
"People sometimes try to do funny things while running away," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove a car into a slope to avoid a bus and attempt to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning for Ben Cousin's biathlon.
Peter Moody says organizers spy on him and threatens to end the race
Peeter Moody accused the organizer of Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stall last year and threatened to immediately end the race.
He focused on the organizers and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and was based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with late scratching Lady Tatai during maintenance on the race day, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he’s always tried to do what’s best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidarin’s positive cover on cobalt, which he can’t explain.
He bit his tongue about allegations of espionage for 18 months and didn’t want it to look like “dry grapes.”
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it's going to get out of you all at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
I’ll go home today and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head up and make the owners think I’m doing my best for them.
If they start thinking the opposite, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I will do with my license.
Earlier, Moody released a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the integrity department tried to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man — whom I'll name after question — and offered him a job in my stalls for getting information about the things that are being done in my stalls," Moody told Racing.com.
They thought I was a fraud.
If so, everyone should show their information, because in an attempt to catch me they completely burned up.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current Chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think this is a personal matter?
Will the RVL let a few balls grow and get people outside of the coaching position to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think it is.
Per they need to take my license and drive me away, and I have no doubt that what I am saying now will give them material for reflection.
But I’ve come to a point where I don’t care anymore, and I’m sad about it.
It really upset me.
I will push them and put the burden on them to make decisions.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The trainer’s levels of frustration have increased with long-term investigations over cobalt including Lidari, and recent scratches in him have aroused the feeling that he could “hour his license on the table.”
Mood, best known for preparing the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, called the rule of treatment on the day of the race "ridiculous" after the horse's legs were applied clay or mud, which is against the rules.
This is against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility,” he said.
Someone from my team mistakenly laid mud on his foot.
It could have been last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it also happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treating the compass on the day of the race, to which the organizers had already opened an investigation.
It is a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
Cobram driver who stole was arrested
Police have arrested a man who struck a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and left after a collision.
The cyclist was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the main road Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with not stopping in an accident, not providing assistance and other traffic offenses.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Returns Hit to Rivals for Wrestling Claims
Craig Bellamy, Melbourne Storm coach, has criticized the interventions of his players as “setting a schedule” by two NRL favorites of the premiership.
Trent Robinson, Sydney Roosters coach, said the referees allowed Storm players to “wrestle” his players during Storm’s controversial team victory in the Sydney qualifying final on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, Brisbane Broncos coach, made a slightly covered note on Strorm after his team won the qualifying final over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening when he called the game a rugby league "show" and according to him two from Queensland were not "too big" to wrestle.
Bellamy defended the interventions of his players and said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation has increased his self-confidence as his team is criticized by two top coaches, which may mean they are afraid of defeat from the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that in the past year we have not changed anything in our defensive system and techniques, in the last few weeks we have only put emphasis on contact during the interventions, and that has meant a turn for us.
Trent has been here for three years and obviously he’s a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock for him.
It’s funny how such things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy dismissed Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the 2010 premiership by playing "dull" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St. George was criticized for being a dull team and Wayne then said he didn’t care.
But now he has a team that can play a style of game that he feels disruptive, especially his young supporters with their speed.
This is the kind of football you would like to play if you had this type of player available.
He said this in 2010 and now wants all teams to play his style of football – but not every team has two backers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can’t play that style.
It gives me more confidence because they say such things because they are afraid of playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t even think of us when they got to big games.
Bellamy also pointed out the fact that more goals were scored in the Storm and Roosters match than in the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos team’s game was probably good, I didn’t look, but what’s the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are the pauses and non-tests interesting?
I think they are agenda.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet again at a certain stage.
Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday evening at AAMI Park.
Serbian man receives $200,000 bail on drug charges
The man who faced a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine, which was confiscated from Queensland, was fined $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police in search of 100 kilograms of drugs from a Solay yacht that arrived from South America via Vanuatu and anchored in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting with the joint defendants in the harbour during the morning and later met with them at Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in the Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possession of cocaine of commercial quality, lawyer Maksimovice set his defense on the fact that there is no evidence that he would own the entire quantity and that he could be in the cafe entirely by accident and innocence.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan believed that Maksimovic would have fled.
He has a strong relationship with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he said on Wednesday at the court.
He lied to the police about where he lived.
His mother and father-in-law Maksimovic jointly offered a bail of $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the oath statements of both persons, it is clear that the $200,000 deposit is a real financial burden for them," Flanagan said.
Their efforts alone were apparently inadequate, as the accused did not appear further in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted a bail on the condition that he would give up both his Australian and Serbian passport, report daily to the police and comply with the ban on leaving from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl’s phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to obtain photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was asleep, then logged in to her on her online chat where he had a lot of nasty photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then looked around and found out that her phone was missing and then found it in the sleeping Hogg’s hand.
She went through it and, before alerting her mother, found disturbing news.
Police engaged and saw five photographs, then analytical computers found the address and discovered "worrying" searches on the web using terms to search for immoral children's images.
Hogg then claimed to police that his reason was "to bring pedophiles" to the internet before "pretending to be a police officer and intimidating them."
Fiscal Attorney Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it’s addiction—that he’s addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the computer search was carried out by him, but said he only wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to intimidate pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
He said he did it to attract them.
He claims to have skipped him in drunkenness and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on her phone, he called his mother, she trembled and cried.
She saw nasty pictures on her phone and the accused was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the accused used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, resident in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted guilt to filing a lawsuit about receiving or providing inappropriate pictures of children on 14 June last year, breached the terms of bail on 25 January and failed to appear at the court hearing on 24 March this year.
The defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on the list of sexual offenders because he may argue that there was "no fundamental sexual subtext" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence to October for filing reports from social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing on other unresolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual offenders before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe Speaks in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell on the stairs leading to the stage earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall became viral on social media.
The opening of the parliament was also defiled by the claims of opposition lawmakers that they had received anonymous threats of killing, warning them against kicking Mr. Mugabe out during his speech.
Last month he was blown out and provoked during his state of the nation speech in parliament — a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Parliamentary party leader Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to hinder Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
"The message comes from a number that doesn't appear, but is named 'death'," he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and once they leave parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, has “preoccupations” about threats to MPs.
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save business services costs.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP CEO and Chairman of the Board, who will head the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP is today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of deals to help transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have annual revenue of more than $50 billion and “will be focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions” to companies.
This will break up the company, founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, a manufacturer of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was nicknamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP was undergoing a massive reorganization to handle the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a closely specialized company has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates have to get for injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed for Wilshere that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there is no reason to not play at Christmas again.
This best scenario already means Wilshere is sure to miss at least four more English games, and, from a history point of view, his involvement in the next summer European Championship is obviously uncertain.
The big shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury and then got back into former shape during the pre-season.
“This kind of injury doesn’t endanger my career,” Wenger said.
It is a wound that needs treatment.
It is nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It did not affect his ankle, nor the injuries he suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, as Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injury whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Wilshere since he made his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has played only 65 league matches for Arsenal out of a total of 157:
From a wider perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six out of eight seasons from 2007-08, he was one of the two Premier League clubs that lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the vicious circle, but Arsenal believes the improvement in injury recorded during the last season will continue.
“Sometimes, when you get back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win competition,” Wenger says.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I’m sure it will and he’ll have the career he deserves.
Arsenal starts the Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to join.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal’s Theo Walcott.
“I try to keep the balance and let the players who need it breathe out,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite to advance from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of being the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also not defeated in a total of 41 games afterining a campaign of "invincible" last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake of magnitude 3.2 on Wednesday night.
This is the 10th time in Zagreb this year.
Wenger thinks Arsenal learned from last season’s Champions League surrender against Monaco and remains a distant hope of bringing the club to its first European Cup victory.
“This is an enormous effort,” Wenger said.
This has never happened to Arsenal.
In 2006 we were very close, but on the other hand I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar displays in different shows is eye-catching, especially given how men need to open up more desperately than ever when it comes to suicides among young men under the age of 15.
In 2013, it was the only leading cause of death among men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of Men, aimed at challenging a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the injured person had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a “healthy mood,” their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends represents half the chance of developing mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, of course, it must first be achievable.
In this communication through social media with an emphasis on style rather than the content of the message, immediate response is often preferred over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun-loving and more successful has doubled, even though we are rather isolated in reality.
This superficial success is ruled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values – our personal desire for growth and friendship – which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as a billionaire and game maker recently explained, money doesn’t really buy more happiness.
The beauty of the series Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities that shone through friendly interaction.
Joey’s humor and Chandler’s frequent sacrifices, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross’s desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they mostly keep their feelings for themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me, “My role as listener to people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed to me that even the slightest friendly interaction can make a difference.”
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying “to deal with it” is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends are one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer a longer-term balance mechanism.
It emphasizes small moments in male friendship.
As for my task, the outsider status on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a more close, from a network of friends and family.
So if you are going to the FrendsFest organized by Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion of the celebration.
Or when you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at him and greet him.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from beginning to end – 236 episodes – for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG throw Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Caviani after scoring a goal against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut and helped PSG defeat Swedish Malmo on Tuesday.
Here is the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a final 2-0 comfort victory against Malmö at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League and this PSG player sent French champions for victory, but then they dropped a few chances until they finally boosted their edge when Cavani shot a head-on goal in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, so the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they are not just focused on qualifying for the elimination, but on improving their way to the quarterfinals they recorded in each of the previous 3 seasons.
But even though they won three points, it wasn’t the classic performance of Laurent Blanc and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was wasted before the goal and was later replaced against his home team and club, where he began his famous career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win in the Champions League either outside or at home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents have trouble and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, even though there are things we'll have to improve with the progress of the season," Blanc said.
That is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret not having scored one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury as one of three changes for the PSG team, which at home scored a 2-2 draw this weekend with Bordeaux in League 1, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was labeled as the man who will push PSG in Europe to a new level after the transfer from Manchester United last month, and showed why by rushing to Marco Verratti’s pass for defending Malmö and by a beautiful finish sending the ball behind Johan Wilanda’s back into the distant corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected this to launch a spectacular victory for PSG, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, which defeated Celtic in the play-off and entered this phase, entered with 9 internationalists in the basic composition and five defenders and two tight backers were a tough opponent.
But except for Nikola Djurdjice’s shot, which just passed the distant corner of Kevin Trapp’s goal in the 34th minute, they didn’t offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves had taken advantage of the attack with bad passes and a miserable finish that was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who failed to shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot arrived in the net shortly after the start of the second half of Cavani.
However, he turned out to be much more suitable when it came to preparing chances for his teammates and it was from his recording that Di Maria sent a spin shot that ended in Wiland’s goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavanim, this Uruguayan headed out the line for the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic played him in the left wing of Maxwell.
This put an end to all Malmo’s thoughts about the possibility that they could make some profit from the match, and only Wilanda’s excellent intervention from close proximity destroyed David Luiz’s hopes and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of alternating Ezequiel Lavezzi was not recognized at the end of the match.
Malmo coach Age Hareide admitted that PSG was a class above his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats down for Paris.
It was an amazing match for them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion from share sales
The Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, which was hit by a crash in commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion from selling shares on Wednesday as part of its large-scale debt reduction plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with crashing commodity prices as China’s economic slowdown reduces demand and ignites scars of destruction across markets.
Rights issues sent Glencore stock prices to a peak on the London stock market in early morning trades on Wednesday.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that a $2.5 billion share sale is part of wider plans to cut their $30 billion debt, which accumulated about a third.
The company sold the new shares at a price of 123 pence per share, representing a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
Thus, 1.3 billion shares were released at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Fears about prolonging the slowdown in China’s growth have dropped the price of iron ore by almost half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms visit of Xi Jinping to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its Tuesday report.
President Xi’s first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, to a national dinner after the talks.
“President Xi’s visit presents an opportunity to strengthen the mutual relations between the United States and China and encourages cooperation in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the differences between the two countries,” the report said.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is scheduled to visit Seattle, where he will meet several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York for the September UN meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address controversial issues, including Washington’s fears of China’s alleged cyber espionage and its growing aggressiveness in the South China Sea.
The refugee crisis has shattered the Schengen area.
The emergency light launched by Germany is far from crushing the European crew, but it is already forcing the ship to change course, the French daily Le Figaro wrote.
The European Union decided on Monday to address the refugee problem first: it would rather systematically sort migrants and asylum-seekers as soon as they enter the old continent – especially in Greece – than to argue over the future distribution of refugees by quotas based on the quantity, which is increasingly distancing itself from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, EU interior ministers have changed priority.
Before worrying about the ultimate destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who arrive today and solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for managing migration," the ministers said in a text discussed on Monday in Brussels.
After the crisis of the single currency, the EU finds itself at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it is not losing its determination and increasing pressure.
It re-establishes border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in that country.
The Central Power thus makes it clear that without it no free movement in Europe is possible.
Austria and Slovakia joined the agreement on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, though with varying intensity.
Hungary has done so long ago.
Such exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under Schengen rules.
It’s a domino effect, but the blind can see.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, in southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already crossed the inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German counterpart Thomas de Maizière discussed the issue intensely during a private interview with their three counterparts from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but is being implemented.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified with fingerprints.
Budapest refuses to introduce any point of entry into its territory because it fears more than others that there will be camps on its shoulders in which refugees will accumulate on its account.
Greece is a black hole.
More than 200,000 people landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, which is twice as many as recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are actual asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after going through crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It is a huge opening.
Athens, which is still in financial turmoil and waiting for a new government, has laid hands on its knees.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and the source of common concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission has promised to introduce checkpoints as soon as possible, but has not given a number or date.
“The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe,” the EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on this front.
The European Union has already deployed the EU border control agency Frontex.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for the reception of asylum seekers and strengthen oversight over the islands.
"Are adequate financial resources needed," warns the text submitted to the ministers for approval.
At the same time, Athens will have the last word.
The question of the creation of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching it.
The new emergency situation in the twenty-eighth century has pushed the issue of mandatory quotas and 160,000 refugees to the second place, which was put forward by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament earlier this year and was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see this as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, wasined on Monday in a text approved by a majority of twenty-eight.
As a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already agreed on during the hectic EU summit in June, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven people have been killed under a lavine in the Alps, including three Czech citizens.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists killed by a lavine in the French Alps.
According to the German authorities, the woman was the only survivor of the eight-member group.
Earlier media reports that it was Polka.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in the city of Briancon with a serious leg injury in the hip area.
According to AFP, the victims were mostly 40 years old.
"The rescue operation has ended, and the bodies of the victims have also been transported to Briancon for identification," said Pierre Besnard, prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The accident occurred around noon in the Pelvoux mountain region under the summit of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins mountain measuring 4015 meters.
“The sudden crash was 250 meters wide and about a meter tall,” said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, an enormous amount of snow fell on the eight-member group at an altitude of about 3,900 meters.
The meteorological service has not warned of bad weather in the area.
Previous Previous post: Bragg vs. Bragg: Finally a true Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský at his premiere in the cups was able to pass with the footballers of Liberce through the fork of the European League into the basic group and now he is looking forward to enjoying the true Europe with the team.
Slovan, at the beginning of the main phase of the competition, welcomes the 2011 finalist Braga and, according to the coach, wants to impose his playing style on her.
After all the nerves in the elimination battles, when every goal and every situation could get you out on your way to the dream group, now we are there and we will play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don’t have to be afraid of every goal we scored, we can play our own tactics and we’re not bound by just a two-match.
“I look forward to it and it’s true Europe, before it was just qualifying,” Trpišovsky said at a news conference.
Braga is a top team.
It will be very active, they have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may be more difficult because he doesn’t have such a name, but at the same time he has a player in his squad, who I guess gave Manchester three goals.
“It’s an excellent whole at the top team level,” Trpišovsky said.
A clear favourite, however, is not Braga.
We play at home, so we are not outsiders.
"I think that we have shown that we are strong at our stadium in the domestic competition and in the front rounds, and we want to confirm this," said the coach, whose team lost from eleven duels this season only the opening Super Cup in Plzeň.
He believes that Liberec can also impose his style on Braze.
We have a team that will be strong on the ball, but at the same time it is untypically disciplined for them.
They play from 4-4-2 with a quick transition to the offensive phase.
"It is a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing is how our players will perform on the pitch," Trpišovsky said.
In the front rounds we studied the opponents a lot, which helped us a lot, this time we want to concentrate on our game, to which we also adapted the training.
"And we definitely want, although it will be very challenging, to play according to our notes," added the coach.
Student films dominate Sand, the international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries have submitted their works to the competition of the 15th International Student Film Festival in Piesko this year.
Four dozen of them, which a commission composed of students and teachers sent to the final, will be screened from 15 to 18 October at the Portyč cinema.
The best of them will be selected by an international jury, said the festival spokesman Jakub Charvát.
Each year, the festival has a special theme, which is derived from the festival sound.
This year it is a detective.
This year’s festival’s director, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre.
“And, of course, we also have to resolve the crime that was committed in this year’s trip,” Charvát said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of the student's work - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, which will include the winner of the previous year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the organizers prepare an accompanying program.
There will be Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turbochanson group Poletíme?, playful band Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with the recital Life at the bar.
The festival will also host two exhibitions.
The first will be the graduate of the Sand Film School and the holder of prestigious awards, among which there is no shortage of World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ašenbrenner.
The second exhibition brings the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
At the meeting with the visitors will come the cameraman and documentarist Martin Čech, the film The Cameraman will accompany Gerhard Gruber with his music and the sandy natives Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the sculptor Jan Novotný’s studio will baptize their new book 3 friends from the city of P. Novotný.
This year we also remember Miroslava Ondříčka, the patron of FAMO in Písk, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his message that will live on.
“Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop joint ties and film craft,” the spokesman said.
The Pitching forum will help to do this, where students can meet with film professionals, take several job trials at once and get a job position.
The festival is associated with the creation of the Private Higher Professional Film School in Piesko.
Its founders, the spouses Vladan and Miloň Terč, organized the first year in 1997.
It was held once every two years until the sixth year.
In the event of a CK bankruptcy, the insurance companies must pay the claims of the clients in full.
The insurance companies should pay the claims of the clients in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency in full.
This was decided on Wednesday by the House of Representatives when it approved an amended amendment to the Law on Business Conditions in Tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to replace insurance against bankruptcy with a bank guarantee.
Insurance companies are not obliged to pay the claims of clients above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Local Development insists on the adjustment, arguing for consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end travel insurance against bankruptcy when the novel comes into effect.
The proposal has also been criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will either have to leave or go abroad.
Minister for Local Development Karla Šlechtová (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not euro-comform.
She pointed to this year’s ruling of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client has the right to a full refund of money regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive sufficient information on the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the correct limit, she stressed.
“We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to be feasible,” said Deputy Chairman of TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
The bank guarantee will not work, because no one will give it unlimited.
“Travel agencies will have to end their activities or move abroad,” Kalousek said.
Tomio Okamura, a member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (SPD), disagreed with Kalouskov’s concerns on the basis of a survey among members of the CK.
“Stop showing us the lobbying of insurance companies,” he said.
The statements of the insurance companies are not considered relevant by Okamura, and there is no official written statement in this sense according to him.
They say they are investigating whether the travel agencies will make a participation, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Jana Fischer (ODS), who referred to the position of the competitive Association of travel agencies of the Czech Republic, and its party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about stepping down the stairs to Czech travel agencies, also warned of the provision.
Travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
“Consumer protection works,” Fischer says.
The proposal to remove the controversial passage was not approved by the House.
Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) did not come up with a proposal to return the proposal to the committee due to the alleged contradiction with the Civil Code.
Philip warned about travel agencies that, according to him, could endanger consumers.
In view of the verdict of the Constitutional Court, the rapporteur of the proposal, Martina Berdychová (ANO), withdrew her proposal, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the insurance does not cover the entire risk.
The new law will not originally propose a minimum insurance limit of four million for travel agencies that offer travel by air, and a million limit for offices that sell, for example, bus trips.
The limit will remain at 30 percent of the planned sales from travel sales.
However, the insurance limit will have to be such that it covers all customer claims in the event of bankruptcy of the travel agency.
The regulation also stipulates that travel agencies will have to newly indicate which travel agency organizes the trip.
Travel agencies will have to provide insurance companies with information about management and number of trips before concluding the contract.
The approved amendment of the Public Administration Committee also counts on further periodic information to insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with monthly data on the number of travellers and sold trips, the total price of sold trips and the amount of advances and sales for trips and vouchers for them.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has failed to comply with any of its legal obligations to the insurance undertaking, it shall, in accordance with the proposal, call on the insurance undertaking to remedy it or may prohibit it from concluding new contracts if the breach of the obligation could jeopardise the interests of customers.
The proposal also reforms the financing of mountain services.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will be submitted until the end of April for the next year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financial plan of spending and a forecast for the next two years.
According to the association, the promoter of the law, however, did not think of the situation what would happen if the insurance company terminates the CK contract.
It will not be allowed to organize the trip and customers who bought the trip before the termination of insurance will lose it according to the association.
In this case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may fail, even if its management was in good condition.
One of the ways that travel agencies can deal with this situation is to bring a lawsuit against the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad and on our market then we will act only as agencies, said the vice president of the association Jan Papež.
According to him, the proposal of the novel also contains the institute of bank guarantee, but so unthinkingly that it can not be implemented in practice at all, because the bank guarantee can not sound to an unlimited amount.
In addition, a change in the current practice is de facto unnecessary.
Within two years, the new EU directive will need to be revised.
In the Czech market currently operates a total of 942 active insured travel agencies.
This year, only three CKs ceased to operate.
National travel agencies sell roughly €20 billion annually.
We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve the humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to limit the arrival of refugees to Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with German Prime Ministers.
He also called for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the 28 member states.
We need to help more countries where refugees leave, or where they stay after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will work for decent conditions in refugee camps, such as in Jordan and Lebanon, she said, according to which such a signal could be greater financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organizations.
"The federal states are also supporting the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the burden of the refugee crisis among European countries," Merkel said.
Brandenburg Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expected real solidarity from all EU countries.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke have also spoken in favour of speeding up the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start integrating foreigners faster, the Brandenburg Prime Minister said.
He also said that most of the money Germany spends on refugees should be spent on the integration of those who have a chance to obtain asylum.
More teachers will be needed for refugees to master German.
It’s a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if we integrate refugees, they can benefit us.
Matt Damon Minimizes Film Diversity
Matt Damon confronted Afro-Ametic filmmaker Effie Brown during a diversity discussion with the claim that it wasn’t necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday HBO episode of the project Greenlight, the actor cast in the series Brown interrupted as she stressed the need for alternative perspectives about black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting a movie, not by casting a show,” says Damon.
Shocked, she reacted scaredly to Brown with mistrust and shouted "Hoo! Wow.
Damon and Brown joined the joint well-known producer Ben Affleck and the brothers Farrelly to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I would like to appeal to people to think, no matter who the director is, how they will behave to the character of Harmony," Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character that is a prostitute packed by a white man.
The producer of Dear White People pushed for the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon said their directing "could eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded in disagreement with Damon’s comment.
MrPooni, a Twitter user, expressed his anger at writing the clip, “Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black woman in the room so he can explain to her that diversity is so white that it hurts.”
The tweet has received more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was published.
Damon’s comment comes at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After teenage Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national influence and pushed lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince made hints on the movement while listing the nominated in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
“Albums are still important,” he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The recent leader of the Black Lives Matter movement issued a statement in response to a question from Fox News personality, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,” the leaders said.
Damon was recently on a list of entertainers, producers, and media moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the appearance of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met with the Pope is unclear.
“American Ninja Warrior has a first winner”
Isaac Caldiero became the first competitor to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday, bringing home $1 million.
In the competition, which just ended its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all obstacles on the track.
During the final of this season, two men fought to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb on a more than 220 m long rope.
Britten completed the climb as the first in the set limit and became the first competitor to overtake the 4th section in American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero overtook it with a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview to E! News immediately after his heavily winning victory and was discovered to be still in shock from winning the $1 million main prize.
“It’s a wonderful feeling, I’ve never earned more than $10,000 a year in my life,” Isaac E! said in response to his win.
“So suddenly... I can’t imagine what it will be like now.”
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the final and why Britten won’t get any reward despite being the first competitor to finish the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the person who finishes the track the fastest.
“If there are more competitors on the track, the winner will be the one with the best time,” said Weed.
Although the winning of the main prize would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
“I don’t think he had any anger in him.
He is pleased that he has achieved what he has achieved.
He received a warm welcome from his fans.
He is a great guy and loves his family.
He is a hero for his wife and children.”
Geoff said to me, “If there was someone who could beat me, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which will start shooting in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers just passed by the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Tigers of Detroit, the second half of the season was not just a walk through the Rose Garden.
The Tiger, one of the best baseball teams, is currently in the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers just tightened their defeat when they defeated Minessota with a tight score of 5-4 on Target Field on Tuesday.
The twins missed a chance to get closer to the Houston Astros team and capture a second wild card in the American League.
Even if only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to the Z, which was so untouchable for them during the second half of the season.
“Winning is always fun and it doesn’t matter in what way,” said Tiger manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger attacker Alfredo Simonined his offensive entry and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took another in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 shots and 3 circles.
It was his third successful game in the last nine games.
“I want to finish this year with convincing results,” Simon said.
“It’s hard to get into a game when you often sit on the bench and so I want to get into the game.”
Tiger puncher Victor Martinez scored three times and made two rounds and his first withdrawn point since mid-August.
For Martinez, this was the first three-point match since the last June game, in which he scored four times in a match against the Seattle Mariners.
“He was very good at it,” Ausmus said.
“He looked good at training, kicked off significantly better and managed to transfer it to the match.”
With three rounds at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins gained the greatest chance of returning to the game.
The midfielder Byron Buxton won the change thanks to two points on the left side of the pitch.
Right-wing Aaron Hicks earned a point thanks to the set pitch and Simon struck out Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-wing Blaine Hardy.
Hardy defeated his only opponent, Mauer, and in front of him was the kickman Miguel Sana, who fired the ball and scored two goals, leaving behind right-wing Drew VerHagen.
With two players on the goals and a chance of a draw in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send a third goal through two goals.
Plouffe has already won 27 rounds over two goals this season and reigns in the league tables.
Detroit held the ninth shift, Mauer scored two points and Bruce Rondon scored 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this left handed out Sana in three surfaces.
Detroit took advantage of the advantages and earned points in the game of Phil Hughes.
The Tigers won three circuits in the first two shifts against a surviving right-wing player who entered the game after more than a month's break due to inflammation of the back muscles.
“I didn’t imagine such a start,” Hughes said, “but in the third shift I felt I was getting better.”
After resisting the strike in the first shift, Hughes dropped one point to the second scorer, Ian Kinsler.
Two departure for the right-wing polar J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez, who was the first to circumvent all the goals.
Victor Martinez broke his series 0-21.
Third goalkeeper Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the pitch and scored another round, but Victor Martinez was overthrown when he tried to reach the third goal.
The Tigers added in the second shift, when overthrower James McCann and polarist Anthony Gose gained two and thus one point and the resulting table shone a score of 3-0.
“It got us to our knees,” said Gemini manager Paul Molitor.
“He didn’t hit the ball very well, but he got it to the right place.”
Hughes, who won on the number of overheads, ended in the third shift without points and was replaced by right-wing A.J. Achter.
Hughes scored three goals, won six rebounds and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right-wing Tiger, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
James Andrews operated Sanchez’s shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured due to stretched muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, is expected to take part in Wednesday's match.
Sanchez will be replaced by Daniel Norris, who returns from an injury to face the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was replaced by left-back David Price, he has scored 1-1 after 4 matches.
However, he has not played since August 20 because of his stretched muscle.
Tiger and Gemini will play their third match at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will face Minnesota left-back Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening the economy to the world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group whose task is Tuesday’s governance reform.
“China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies,” he said on the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group on Deepening Global Reform.
Promoting openness in the coming reforms will give new momentum and vitality, as well as a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Leading Group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of regulatory market access, the easing of border control policies, the support of state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital, and the reorganization of the resident registration system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up to identify sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs.
This step is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and ensure that the companies themselves decide how to run their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be opened to private investment.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad and will provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a “green card,” thanks to the optimization of requirements and the simplification of the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
There may be new bedrooms in the district.
According to Deputy Head of the Karlovarsky Region Jakub Panik (ČSSD), the current capacity of the bed departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
There are also opportunities for extended care.
For example, in the department of surgical departments, one-day surgical centers could be created, where, according to the set concept, surgical exercises that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be performed.
In which specific hospitals the workplace focused on one-day surgery should be, it is not yet clear.
In the skin department of the Karlovy Vary Hospital, a laser center could be created with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalical center to take care of patients with brain impairment who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthetic-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the Hospital of Ostrov, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovarsky region, is the beds of subsequent care, especially the beds of long-term sick people (LDN), the capacity of which in Nejdku is insufficient and should be closely linked to the beds of acute care.
Part of this facility should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, the concept recommends.
As he points out, the beds are missing mainly in the Karlovy Vary Hospital.
It would be possible to use abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, there are no social health beds in Karlovy Vary with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
These beds are lacking throughout the republic, so it could also serve as the so-called Alzheimer’s Centre for other countries.
According to the recommendation, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, on which funds from European subsidies will be released.
"These are beds that will be linked to the fields of superspecialized care and will form a space for translation of patients after the procedure, for example, after a cardiochirurgical, neurochirurgical, transplant or other procedure," describes the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the area of psychiatric care.
