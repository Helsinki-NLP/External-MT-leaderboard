The Prague stock market is going to a negative near the end of the year.
After the steep decline in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct its losses.
The transactions in the shares of ČEZ amounted to almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague stock exchange immediately began trading on Tuesday, following the collapse on Monday, when it fell another six percentage points.
This time it was because of the Wall Street bust.
The Czech Republic also reflects the market reaction to the result of the vote in the US House of Representatives, which refused to support a financial sector stabilisation plan.
The fall of stocks in Asia
Shares on Asian exchanges fell dramatically on Tuesday, although indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index lost almost four percentage points during the course of the business day, but was later able to make up for some of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, with the markets closed in Shanghai.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5 percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market fell 3.6 percent after the Taiwan index.
"The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide", said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
The US legislature should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and pass the draft financial support bill, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.
Otherwise, other countries could be affected by the break-in.
A bloodbath of American stocks
The US House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which would cost up to $700 billion.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush believed that the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the economy as a whole.
U.S. stocks were in a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indexes recorded their biggest slump in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, a similar drop it had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but as soon as there were signs that the draft would not pass the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes a concession: US government can pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance to the American financial system.
The vote on this is due to take place early next week.
The American legislature made a breakthrough in talks to pass a $700 billion bailout for the American financial system.
But this is not a victory.
The lawmakers still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the US Congress on Monday.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
According to economists, a notice that the plan is being adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for a revival of financial markets.
However, there is a 'discouragement' afterwards, because of the complex mechanisms that could help the markets in practice.
The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a market stabilization package should look like", Democratic Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
The Commission has not yet decided on the matter.
Representatives of the legislature met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to finalize the government fund.
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission should be able to take a decision on the basis of the information provided by the Member States.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective in the market.
The recovery plan still needs to be continued, but I think we are on track", Paulson said.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also having a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are working to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
The idea is to reassure investors that Asian financial markets are in the first time zone where a congressional decision could affect business on Monday.
But it is not yet clear when both houses of the US Congress will vote on the bill, and it is unclear whether the negotiations could fail at the last minute on a problem.
The lawmakers hope it will be passed in the next few days.
But the law will undergo some changes.
The total amount of aid for the scheme is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
But Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it feels that the program is not doing its job, with another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush welcomes progress in the negotiations
The President has veto power over this decision, but Congress can override his veto.
But despite these changes, the basic idea of the program has remained, which was based on obtaining financing to buy bad mortgage securities that have fallen in value because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to pay back their mortgages.
"We worked it all out.
The House should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, then the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush also expressed satisfaction with the progress.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and "appreciates the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said the legislators had agreed on responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing concessions and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies participating in the programme and to set up a committee to oversee the fund.
This is to be run by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very hard on this and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for homeowners who are having trouble repaying their mortgages.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages it buys, with the goal of reducing the monthly costs for the borrowers and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help for the elderly
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that is because you don't know what mechanism and what price the problem assets are being bought back.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses between themselves", Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or early next week is not decisive in Marek's view.
"Much more importantly, congressmen agree to support the plan and pass it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement to have a goodbye is the most important thing at this moment", Marek stressed.
Duel on knife edge: MP3 players against cell phones.
We will advise you on your choice
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are plenty of reasons to get a standalone player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the demands of the future owner.
I'm sure it's hard to buy a great, expensive record player at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
But if you have art rock, jazz or blues on your shelf, you probably dream of at least one of these.
So it's the same with music on the road, so with compressed music, in simple terms - MP3 music.
Again, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand kroner on a player, but a Pink Floyd fan will probably find it hard to afford a twenty-krone headphone from the market.
Two extremes, with enough room for each.
The selection is wide.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can do much more than just play music, but what cell phones can do, they can't even do in a hint.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the basic functions of calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, it has a better camera, a worse one, and maybe it can navigate.
And if you add the smartphones and the communicators, you've got almost a little computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can take pictures.
But the universality of mobile phones also has its drawbacks.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you'll need to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy-consumers.
Few phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, but most are much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more powerful.
So you should expect that cheap phones will not be able to play music for more than a few hours.
If you do have to use the phone occasionally, you might want to buy a charger for the office - even for more expensive devices - to be sure.
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, even the less good ones can last at least nine hours of uninterrupted operation on a single charge.
Another problem is when you want to play music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small number of devices have a USB port, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play music directly on a storage medium, but few card readers can handle the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones without reduction.
With players, you don't need any special software, except for the iPod.
You just need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players set up their own music library, sorted by artist name, album title, genre, or user rating.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address book, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iRiver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a particular device, you should ask about the battery life, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound and, of course, the comfort of use.
If music is your main setting and you listen to it only briefly every day, for example on the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which is something almost any phone can do.
You also don't have to control the music formats that a phone or a player can handle.
MP3s are what everyone is making, and most of the music you're going to get is going to be in that format right now.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also make it possible to buy music online.
You just have to go to the relevant websites of a provider (or another provider) via the mobile Internet and you can buy a song or an album.
This service in itself can be a powerful argument for why you should get a music phone.
Unfortunately, the providers' offer is poor and is mostly limited to quick radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
But it is generally expected that this type of music sales (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their cell phones.
If you feel like listening, reach for the phone in your jacket pocket while the player lies at home.
But it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless voice-over device.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only a few MP3 players.
For many, the greatest advantage of music phones will be in the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three or four thousand crowns you can get a decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most of them is that they don't have regular headphones.
The best and most technically advanced phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand kroner.
The advantage of the players is that they are easy to operate.
The simplest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - players can really be used by anyone.
A minimum of functionality, similarity in operation to the former normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no danger of collision in the form of a mistaken mobile internet connection and a subsequent horrendous data bill.
What device should you use now?
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns will be enough.
But be careful.
The basic models generally only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones can read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, go to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton, or whatever.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you will not have to put more than 1100 kroner on the table.
If you're one of the more sophisticated listeners, you'd rather get specialized cell phones -- walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate MP3 control buttons, and the user experience is similar to that of a single MP3 player.
The farthest away is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series phones have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours maximum) are provided by MP3 players of the aforementioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider will be in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe I should .
The Czech mobile market is quite mature, with Czech providers offering virtually all services as well as those offered by their Western European partners.
However, something is missing - a virtual vendor that forces the traditional ones to lower prices.
Maybe this one won't keep you waiting.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that the Czech mobile operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by the Telecommunications Authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
The latest steps taken by the European Commission to regulate roaming charges are likely to lead to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a fight.
It may seem paradoxical, but there are three mobile networks in the Czech Republic and penetration is well over 100%.
The mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain about the fact that there is an extremely high level of competition on the Czech market.
This is often echoed by the Chairman of the Board of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, who has often said in the past that there is no room in the Czech Republic for another provider.
It is likely that a traditional provider with its own network would not have many opportunities (and would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual provider.
The introduction of virtual providers into the mobile market was the main cause of a significant price reduction, to which the traditional mobile operators had to respond.
Before the entry of companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the UK market, there were similar votes as in the Czech Republic.
But it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you don't have to look for examples for long.
In February this year, we reported on the launch of the mobile-only service provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, the company has managed to attract more than 100,000 customers, making it the fifth largest provider in the country.
Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to operate effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a traditional provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually present themselves as low-cost companies - offering cheap phone calls and SMS, but often with a less extensive service offering.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half the price of its competitors.
However, as Mobilking's example in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to target a non-clichéd target group.
This is a company that is specifically targeted at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust", says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could also take hold in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone's spokesman Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: 'The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment where most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services".
In the Czech Republic, the mobile operators say that there is no chance
But it's almost certain that when a virtual mobile phone company takes over the Czech Republic, it won't be Mobilking.
"While we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very promising.
It will be more likely to be a market entry of Mobilking in other countries in our region", said Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has long been a sign of the GTS Novera group, which wants to take a further step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the corporate segment.
"We have a strong interest in offering not only fixed network but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them,' said Pavel Kaidl, the group's press spokesman.
Maybe better times are coming.
The first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year, according to unofficial information.
But so far, this has been surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
'At this moment we do not assume that there is room in the Czech Republic for a full-fledged virtual provider.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no entity has approached us with a complex and serious project in this area", says Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefónica O2 in his statement to Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also pointed out by other suppliers.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds, in rare agreement with O2's statement: 'We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build.'
And she adds: "T-Mobile's network will have hardly any virtual vendors by the end of the year.
We would have to have a concrete offer at this point to be able to think so short-term".
Vodafone is focusing more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický comments: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the best from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for high-speed mobile internet.'
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the suppliers
The behaviour of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would mean more competition, which would lead to lower prices and thus a decrease in profits.
So why should such a competitor be given easier access to the market?
The fact that the providers can pull together when it comes to something is also evidence of the long back and forth that led to the emergence of U:fon.
The most powerful pressure on ČTÚ came from T-Mobile at the time of the launch of U:fon.
This is also shown by the publicly available information on the ČTÚ websites.
But U:fon is a good argument for not allowing a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: 'The competitive environment in the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, in particular, on its services.'
However, in view of this approach by mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
The Czech Republic, unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries, is unfortunately not competent to intervene in economic competition.
The Commission has the exclusive competence of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
But this was his very typical attitude to the whole problem.
'The entry of a mobile virtual network operator into the market would be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile network operator and a virtual network operator for the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional providers", said Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS in his reply to our inquiry.
Such a wording would not surprise the representatives of the suppliers.
This is more than a matter of concern from an authority which represents the interests of consumers and which is supposed, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses his position on the market.
In particular, as Kristián Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual providers operate quite normally, it can be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile telephone services".
However, it is likely that pressure on the proper functioning of the market and price reduction are not in the ÚOHS's interests.
What is really shocking in this case is the almost touching consistency of the three mobile operators in their responses.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolute unchanging price of petrol at petrol stations is surely just a coincidence and the result of a fierce competition.
'The Authority has not found in this case any evidence of anti-competitive conduct and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the suppliers has a dominant position on the market and therefore does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for its actions on the market.
The telecommunications regulator is also likely to lack the necessary tools to open up the mobile market to virtual providers", Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the consent of the network operator is always necessary for the entry of a virtual provider into the market.
And the mobile phone company has, logically, the monopoly on its network.
This means that it necessarily has a dominant position in a particular segment.
Even if this argument is not accepted, it should be at least a warning to the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are strikingly similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The transfer of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent amendment to the Telecommunications Act did not succeed in extending the competence of the ČTÚ to the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this all too well, but they probably have other interests.
I can do it if nobody's watching
The first thing that is not taken into account is the operation of some pseudo-virtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but these are only partially public.
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission should be able to take a decision on the basis of the information provided by the Member States.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others offer their own mobile telephone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only a select few.
The funny thing is that the company is acting as a traditional corporate customer to the operator, ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a key customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resales.
"If there are cases you describe, it could be a breach of the contractual terms, which we will deal with, which could lead to the termination of the cooperation with the company concerned", Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this problem.
It is, however, unlikely that such a thing is not being talked about by the operators of mobile telephone services.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, thousands of customers may be involved.
However, no operator opposes such a procedure.
The fact is that these companies generate significant profits from their activities and, unlike the actual virtual suppliers, are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the potential problems: "The law allows for such speculation, but the services of these companies are used by only a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as normal customers of mobile operators".
But that alone would seem strange to the CTU.
Furthermore, a further question arises for the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to this, why block off a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong powers to detect such activities and if it does not wish to, it does not have to be satisfied with the providers' declaration that they did not know about it and that their terms of business would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has been emphasised several times in the text, the entry of virtual providers into the market has led to a significant fall in the prices of the various services.
In virtually all countries where virtual providers have emerged, traditional providers have tried to prevent them from emerging in a more or less practical way.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - too small or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the advanced countries, however, it was at this time that the regulators intervened, not in the interests of the mobile operators but in the interests of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual operator, and others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole thing away like a hot potato.
In our experience, we cannot escape the impression that in these cases, uncertainty in competence is more than favourable.
But let's not throw the gun in the face.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon be back in motion.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will not remain idle when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) further applicants.
And the Czechs will finally stop paying more than the rest of Europe for their phone calls.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the Best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem "Where is my homeland?" at a celebration of the Czech Statehood Day.
The anthem was re-recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choral form and in an instrumental version.
The vocal composition was taken over by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editing of the hymn versions is done by Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions at once.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already told the Czech Radio that he had selected singers with young, representative voices, who are distinctive and popular for the solo versions.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep the diction clear, both with the choir and with the orchestra, so that the text could be understood and harmony could be created", says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Stendtheater in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was composed by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people adopted it spontaneously.
The first stanza of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the "new" anthem?
Prague transport operators will also be using a chip for the first time on Wednesday.
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will go down in Prague transport history as the date when the first passengers to board a subway, tram or bus carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The Commission has also proposed a number of measures to improve the quality of the information provided by the Member States.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it simultaneously redeemed on their chip card at the information centres and branches of the transport operators at the Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The coupons are also available on the Internet since yesterday on the websites of transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon.
Those who use the Internet can really forget the subway ticketing window, where they have regularly had to wait in long lines for their paper tickets.
The coupon is purchased online and is then played on the Opencard at one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"These places also offer a desk with trained staff who can advise on internet purchases and also play the coupon on the map", says Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on the Opencard at self-service machines, which are located in some subway lobbies.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket counters, which passengers may have already noticed at the subway stations of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are five of them in the city at the moment, but by the end of the year there will be eighty", adds Opatrný.
The coupon is controlled by an automaton instead of the driver
Operating the vending machines, which will be operational tomorrow, is simple.
You just need to enter the chip card, and the pre-purchased coupon will play itself out.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
The suburban trains and bus lines 300 to 499 are used to reach the capital, mainly by residents of the municipalities in the Central Bohemian region.
"On the trains that are part of Prague's integrated transport system, train attendants have readers that allow them to check the validity of the coupons by time and zone", explains Filip Drápal of the ticket control organisation Ropid, which compiles the timetables for Prague's transport operators.
Suburban buses have card readers at the driver's counter.
The chip card must not only be shown to the driver when boarding, but the Opencard must be placed in a marked place on the side of the cash register.
This is used by the driver to check the validity of the coupons displayed.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the displayed coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information", Drápal says.
A passenger who does not travel on suburban buses and does not know when the coupon expires can go back to the self-service ATMs where the coupons are displayed on the card.
This will display the information on the validity of his documents on the device's display.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the United States
The Sudeten Germans had requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States in 1945.
This is according to a letter in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly asked the U.S. president to do so.
This is shown, among other things, by a letter preserved in a private archive and now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the American President not to allow the return of the "debt swap" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure that the American units are not entering German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", says a letter signed "People who care about the fate of the Sudeten".
Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia suggests to the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national character - that they would expect brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate of the Bohemian Forest for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you, without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this region, are giving to a foreign state which oppresses and seeks to eliminate minorities and has done nothing to help the Allied victory", the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is supposedly the fear of revenge from the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president doubts the sentiments of the Bohemian Germans, it is sufficient that he initiate a referendum in the Bohemian Forest to decide whether the inhabitants want to become part of the US or live under the protection of the US.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of postwar history, some contemporary witnesses believe that it paints a good picture of the Sudeten German expectations of the time.
Even if the Bohemian Germans had to at least suspect that their deportation from the Republic would be negotiated, few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some expected that the United States and Britain would negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis, also confirms this.
He was a Budweiser German in the Baltic Sea during the war.
When he was taken prisoner by the British at the end of the war and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that when they came home, they would be comfortable in Czech", says Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war thought that they would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
If you don't think so, then pay!
An emotional campaign for motorists
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
This is also the characteristic of the emotional media campaign which the Ministry of Transport is planning to launch on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises to discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will be broadcast on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and on flyers.
It's designed to discourage drivers from speeding and drinking.
And remind them to get dressed before they get on.
The campaign aims to appeal to the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, not least, professional motorists.
And what do they show in the commercials?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotion.
This is also reflected in the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
If you don't think so, then pay!
The words "doesn't think" are in capital letters on a license plate.
And in a bloodstain, the word "paid".
This is supposed to mean that you can pay for a moment of inattention with your life.
The ads will shock viewers by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see quite normal images with dramatic shots of accident victims.
The number of accidents and fatalities on Czech roads is expected to decrease.
The spots were compiled by Euro RSCG.
Sugarloaf and whips for the motorists
"The motto for the drivers is sugar and whips.
Sugar bread means that if they drive in red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk", says the traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital, Martin Kořán.
And that is why press information campaigns and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist believes.
He also said that signs warning drivers of danger are even less effective.
"If you put up a static warning sign, it will probably soon blend in with the surroundings and drivers will not notice it", says Kořán.
Olmert would give back almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
The President of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has spoken in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if in exchange for this peace could be concluded with Palestine and Syria.
He emphasized this in an interview published Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all, if not all, of the (occupied) territories", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (of Israeli territory) because without that there will be no peace", he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, doesn't want tractors or bulldozers rolling over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to forgo a part of Jerusalem", Olmert noted, referring to two attacks in the city in July that killed several people and injured dozens.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work", he continued.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert has spoken in favour of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for concluding a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of withdrawal from the Golan Heights", Olmert said.
"The Syrians know all too well what they must give up to get back the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shia) Hezbollah movement; they will have to give up the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shia) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Qaeda and the jihad (holy war) in Iraq", the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
She doesn't know the law. She's not allowed to walk around on a long-distance bus.
The tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, raises the question of whether stewards and passengers are allowed to move around on the bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is in contradiction with the law on road traffic", says Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident that killed a 22-year-old flight attendant last week was probably caused by the driver of the truck that crossed the bus.
The young woman was sitting, unfortunately, next to the driver in the least secure seat in the car at that moment, although she had two more seats available.
But a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply while the steward is carrying out coffee or newspapers.
It is also important whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces according to the vehicle licence.
If this is not provided for on the bus, passengers must sit.
The buses of Student Agency have no stops, as the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and they initially disapproved of the movement of travellers.
This was later withdrawn and we reached a consensus that passengers can use the toilet during the journey if they have their seat", he said.
The law doesn 't know stewards
"There is no clear legal definition of the role of a steward - no legal regulations describe this role.
However, there is no legal provision prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The road traffic law only knows the term 'car escort', but it does not define their rights and obligations", adds Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this problem ex post.
"It depends on whether the bus has stops in the product approval.
That's all", he stresses.
Buses are divided into city buses with stops and a maximum speed limit, local buses with stops and a higher speed limit and long-distance buses without stops with the maximum speed limit and seats fitted with seat belts.
Like in an airplane, says the expert
BESIP's road safety expert Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"There are few hazards in a fluid mode, comparable to the service on board an airplane.
"And here too, you're not sure when turbulence will come, and the stewardess may bump her head".
"But if you brake a bus sharply, then of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations", he says, adding that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company to offer steward services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director doesn't see her profession as risky after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's job is risky, I'll fire him.
Coffee and newspapers are available for passengers upon boarding.
This would also reduce costs", he says.
The director of Asiana, Alexei Litvin, cited the lack of stewards in his buses as a reason for his concern for safety, but his company operates only a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, but we've been fighting since the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end in some fatal accident", he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
A young flight attendant from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, was killed in the accident of a regular bus to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably had turned off the lane without blinking and blocked the bus.
The bus driver tried to evade by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part of the truck.
Jančura denies that the two seats for the stewards were sold.
"These seats cannot be reserved on long-distance calls, they are blocked".
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court's ruling, but it also expects financial compensation from the guilty party.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
A more detailed regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could lead to a legal regulation which a team of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working on for over a year.
"However, this has not yet led to any concrete conclusions.
Buses are not necessarily on the agenda, but rather the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones while driving", says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards as something that could significantly endanger the safety of the passengers", says Hanzelka, while the police and occupational safety authorities are responsible for controlling the safety of the buses.
Dusseldorf's hopes are in Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB Board to the employees of the House is not without its big words.
The letter, which was published on Monday, states that the merger of the Düsseldorf financial institution and the Frankfurt Deka Bank could create "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe".
WestLB would bring a 'competence block' with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And in general, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the national banking sector.
That's what happens when a board of directors wants to show their ability to act in a difficult time.
The Commission has not yet decided on the future of the Community.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which has only recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalian state government that the time is ripe for a future solution.
However, there has been talk for some time about a connection between Deka-Bank, which is known to savings bank customers through its investment funds, and WestLB, including on the Frankfurt side.
While Deka Bank's CEO Franz Waas made it clear at the end of August, when presenting the half-yearly figures, that he did not see the point of a merger between the Mainzer Landstraße bank and a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which is half-funded by the Landesbanks and the savings banks' associations, has instructed the Board to hold talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts thereof.
The talks have, of course, just begun, as the financial centre says.
Deka-Bank, which is one of the main employers in the Frankfurt financial centre with its 3000 employees, is not the first to be mentioned in the context of consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that Deka-Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
But the trio did not succeed.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hessian state government opposed any participation by Helaba.
The other two houses also failed to fit together.
The Land Rhineland-Palatinate was instead transferred to the Land Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have been repeated speculations about a link between Deka Bank and the national banks.
However, most recently Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had spoken out against Planspiele's association with his house.
However, it seems that the recognition is growing that a merger of the various bodies in the public sector is needed.
The Commission notes that the Bank's shareholders are not in a position to take any decisions on the restructuring plan.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure is on to merge more, you'll gradually be leaving the partners behind.
In the south, it would be merely a junior partner, although it has so far far withstood the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The savings bank and credit union Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85 percent stake in Helaba, put forward a proposal for a merger with West LB at the beginning of the year.
It would be the North LB.
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
The other is the question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the crucial question of which business model should be used to ensure the future viability of the Landesbanks had not yet been answered by the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
The final result could be a break-up of West LB, which is obviously not desirable there.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a directive.
How this can be reconciled with the merger of individual entities with Deka Bank remains to be seen.
The second Wieswinkel is known as the "Italian Weekend"
It's the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time, Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and he says that everything is different.
Behind them, at the Kaiser five-liter beer barrel, stands a massive bearded tiger, proving to the 200 or so Oktoberfest visitors how deep sounds its throat can make.
Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova station, four buses depart at 11:45 p.m. that evening, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival expected at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved mainly for Italians, one bus travels exclusively for Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated in the night.
And Marco Guarda says that's not Italian.
Marco, wearing a long fur coat and wide silver bracelets, owns the buses.
They've been going to Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year alone.
He goes there at night, takes the Wiesn during the day, returns at 10.30.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The price of the trip, the welcome drink with Kaiser-bier, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt - are 75 euros.
And the buses are rolling into the night on the highway towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet on the bus, the passengers sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
The first buses are held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian plates stop on the motorway 8 just outside Munich.
When Marcos' group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at 7:30 a.m. as scheduled, the other 50 buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in fracture, next to the Internet address of Marcos' travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors open to the beer tent, it's run!" Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, or we'll block, and not spread all the yellow hats on the same benches, in the room!"
The measure, Marco roars, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the tip, you know.
"Show the security guys we're behaving!
As soon as you leave the seats, they're gone!"
Third, "Tonight at half past eleven, we'll find you again". Do you understand?
We're going to Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap is tied to the trees, signs, and even the election poster of a major Bavarian party as road markers.
You want to be ready for the retreat.
It's the second Wiener weekend, known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 people travelling over the Alps and visiting the beer tents, and 10 per cent of all visitors are said to have arrived from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrolean police officers, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps a national statistic in which Italians are in first place ahead of the British (about 60 operations) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical supplies.
The most popular among Italians is the Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relatively" and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared from the crisis-like developments.
Because it's just the weekend.
The Dax-listed Munich real estate lender Hypo Real Estate (HRE) is receiving a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate would only have to pay interest on the part it also claims.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background is losses on daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state financier had refinanced itself extremely short-term for long-term projects for which it had lent money - which is no longer possible because of distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the Bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 per cent to EUR 2,37 million, while the equity ratio had also fallen slightly from 1,6 to 1,45 per cent.
Current and net income from financial operations were zero compared with the same period of the previous year, while income from credit claims and certain securities and from the liquidation of provisions in the credit business decreased by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only higher returns from reimbursements of downstream costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the taxation rules and from the business settlement for group companies, had left the loss of earnings at around 16% still moderate.
The former state financier had, after its privatisation in 1990, initially speculated on commercial real estate loans, which were then divested to Aareal Bank.
Because it did not make enough money in traditional state financing, Depfa had then become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects between private investors and the state (private-public partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate will now have to write down the value of the subsidiary, which will have a 'substantial material effect' on the group's profit and loss statement, it is quite vague.
The fact is, the dividend was cut.
In 2007, it had already been cut by two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the acquisition of Depfa.
It is more dependent on interbank refinancing than other institutions, as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has again largely dried up as banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing for a part of the DEFFA loan portfolio - around EUR 50 billion - each year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the loan will cover the group's financing needs for the foreseeable future and shield the company "from the influence of the currently largely dysfunctional international money markets".
Other sources indicate that the funds have secured the refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE's CEO Georg Funke stated that Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) consider that the marketable position of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is the hope of the bank's shareholders and creditors.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not inconceivable that the financing will not have to be used in full.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
As the bank was reportedly still on the verge of bankruptcy late Sunday evening, even the at least temporary bailout failed to calm the mood.
The share price is falling by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The bond prices are holding up quite well.
If the primary debt were to show little movement, the secondary bond prices would be more pronounced.
The main concerns are the bonds of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009.
If hypo-real estate bonds used to appear as a speculative investment alternative, their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system, after the sharp intensification of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had taken the crisis in with the takeover of the DEFFA.
As long as central banks, governments and less-favoured commercial banks are still willing to support the system, pensions can be paid on time.
Or it will happen what hardly anyone dares to hope for at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the light of the reports of partial nationalization, the possibility of a security situation has now become a legitimate hope.
This should give longterm creditors in particular some sleepless nights deciding whether to disengage from their commitments.
Short-term investors can use a closing line to make a loss statement for future pre-tax payments on exchange rate gains in later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is introduced to Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls start to giggle: "The German is absolutely kawaii!"
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"First day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had trouble before I went to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, in the direction of Kawasaki, and it's a 40-minute train ride to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the lesson at Tachibana does not seem as strict as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students enter from eight o'clock until a brief round of meetings with the teacher, the 'home room', begins at nine-twenty-five.
But before class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type of person who likes to speak in front of people, let alone a class of 40 students.
Since I did not yet have a school uniform, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, plus a blouse, blue knee socks, and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the elevator and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sayonara where is Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started to learn the language more than two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class were all flirting and giggling and waving and all the time I heard the word "kawaii".
I knew that from my manga.
It is a vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'nice, sweet.'
Then I quickly got back to my seat.
The girl next to me had a pretty big grin, and she was honored to have the exchange student sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the bell rang, I was completely overwhelmed.
Everyone was talking and giggling and asking me about holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then, during the break, everyone unpacked their Bentos.
My host mother had made me a lunch box like that - something different from the dull German loafers.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, a salad of cucumbers and seaweed, fruit and some kind of meat in a tofu coat.
I don't know what I'm eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
I'm sure everything is really good.
Well, except for the salted plums, maybe, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a homemade bento, which she then creates with great ingenuity - hoping to get to know the boy more at the snack bar.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch this.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I used to say:
"Because I'm fascinated by it".
After all, I've been reading manga for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture, I also started learning a little bit of Japanese.
So it was clear to me that I had to come here at some point.
Because I have a soft spot for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're very important here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen".
Even rats have feelings
A rat or a sparrow fleeing danger, does that mean it feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings too.
But how can we know if they feel the same way when they behave like us?
The online journal "Edge" has been publishing contributions by famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a series of selected answers to the question "What do you believe to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness that I or anyone else has been able to prove so far, whereas we can't even prove that other humans have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But once we turn to another species and we tackle issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter rough terrain because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does what many other animals do: It pretends to be dead, flies, or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, which some scientists conclude is a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to translate our subjective experience to that of animals.
For one thing , the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and execution / control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
So at least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are and the ability to plan and make decisions, there's reason to believe that humans are even different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature may lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since so much of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, you could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly be influenced by it, so that animal consciousness, whatever its form, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
That's why it's hard to tell what consciousness might look like in other animals.
If it is something internal and subjective, which cannot be measured or analyzed because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, then its exploration presents us with great problems.
Most of my presentations relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more accessible scientifically.
You could study the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their content, and that's exactly what happens in studies of the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, relies more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: they may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the process of visualization.
What about the sensations?
I'm guiding them back to the fact that an emotional system like fear is activated in a conscious brain that is aware of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies working memory.
Sensation is closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates, and humans in particular.
In connection with the linguistic nature, there are subtle degrees of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states, to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations arise from more primitive activities in the body sensation regions of the cortex and the brainstem, similar to Jaak Pankseep, but focusing more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in sensations across species.
I cannot dispute this in theory, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what seems to be fear in rats and humans is likely to feel the same in both cases: But how can we check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A fox flee when threatened, does he feel fear?
In my view, mere similarity of behaviour cannot prove similarity of experience.
Neural comparisons help us to see that rats and humans have similar brain stem sets, whereas cockroaches don't even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it in humans, how would you prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have senses.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I'd rather study emotional behavior than rat emotional sensations.
But there's progress at the neural level, if you measure the same in rats and humans.
Just as I don't study language and consciousness in rats, I don't study sensations, and I don't know if they exist.
You may think I'm shortsighted, but I'd rather be ahead than running into a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotional guy.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vashunik said that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championship together with Poland", said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is much to be done in both countries".
The two hosts are lagging behind in the timetable for the construction or conversion of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
The number of EM stages may even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at maximum speed", said Ukrainian Federation President Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us".
A more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslav Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules", Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer".
Several first-team players were sentenced to forced relegation for manipulation last season alone, and even the league start had to be postponed for a short time.
Angry Dennis Quaid is striking back
She was promoting a new movie, spoke about privacy in an interview, and now she's in trouble with her ex, Hollywood star Meg Ryan, who exposed her late husband, Dennis Quaid, as an adulterer.
He foams and he hits back.
Late Rose Wars with ex-spouses Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an unpleasant fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan first expressed the reasons for the marriage's failure: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful".
The extent of the fraud was not revealed to her until after the divorce.
The occasion for the psychic strip was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulterous marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's monstrous", the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, "that Meg is chewing and re-typing the history of our relationship again and again".
It is also "unfortunate" that their 16-year-old son Jack is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheaval that divorce means for every child".
While Ryan has been living alone since his divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently fathered twins.
And so he concludes his introductions with the side-note: "My life goes on anyway.
I am fortunate to have a wonderful family that is doing well".
Air and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights have become as much as 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and hotel accommodations have become cheaper again, according to a study by travel and financial services company American Express.
The company analysed its book data for the first half of 2008 and found a significant decrease in the second quarter after an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After years of rising hotel prices, overnight stays have become cheaper in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared with 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most pronounced in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express blames the weak dollar for "a declining appetite among American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent, even topping the European record.
The trend in airfares also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in kerosene, economy class passengers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy class air tickets fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first class the price changes were much smaller.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9%, while in the second quarter they fell by 23.6%.
The study even found that German domestic flights have halved their prices.
The company explains that the reason for the price decline is the slowdown in economic growth.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is falling.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the USA and Europe, creates increased competitive pressure.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
HSV is beating Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV will be the leader of the table.
At the Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a working XI.
From Kristoffer Klein, the team is expanding the field for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came in late and failed with a lever to the plate.
His message was clear, and it was convincing.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate", whispered Hermann Rieger in the cockpit of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much was going on in the catacombs, the halftime break was over and most were back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist at HSV for almost three decades, enjoying a higher reputation than some of the most accomplished actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
The order will have sounded similar:
The implementation was not completed.
"It was not a good day", Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have liked it "more relaxed".
The 1-0 (1:0) Hamburgers have to thank the headball hit by Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty win", Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburg SV turns 121 this Monday.
The audience celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which identified their club as the class leader.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify this", said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the interim tabling evidence is more about the League's unpredictability than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late-bonded arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the Jansen recruited from FC Bayern - is slow to be found, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbling", Jol demanded.
After the vote was lost
Wall Street is the place to be.
Initial news of the failure of the bailout caused the Dow Jones to temporarily crash by 700 points.
That was the biggest one-day point loss in his history.
Later, the Dow got a little bit more involved.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer was down by more than five percent on 10,579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down more than seven percent at 1,548 points.
The biggest losers at that time were Dow American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America, which lost about 12 percent.
No title could be added.
The shares of Goldman Sachs fell by almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, big investor Warren Buffett had a stake in the company.
The rescue plan is to provide the funds to buy up so-called bad mortgage bonds.
The payment is not to be made all at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive stock options from financial companies which could be redeemed if the exchange rate changed in order to reduce the burden on the State treasury.
Share prices in Europe and the US downward
The billions of dollars in aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not solve investors' doubts.
The stock price of the German big bank Hypo Real Estate is plunging, tearing the Dax down.
The Dow Jones is losing despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the government.
Spectacular losses at Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have brought the German stock index (DAX) to a low point.
The shares of the Munich real estate financer lost three quarters of their value, while Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent, despite the bailout of the German government and private banks.
The Dax slipped well below the psychologically important 6,000 mark, and recorded a 3.7 percent decline at 5,839.
The stock markets around the world were in a state of collapse.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's $700 billion bailout might not be enough to revive the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first hour of trading to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives was set to vote on the bailout, with a Senate vote expected on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London the FTSE index initially fell by 3.2%, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 per cent and closed at 12,595.75 meters.
In the MDax, Arcandor's shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also announced that it would not sell its shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has perplexed researchers: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft flew through space.
Because of the soon-to-freeze fuel lines, you're now in danger of dying of cold.
For years, scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon called the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is a flight maneuver by space probes to gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the earth.
This will save the probes a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens spacecraft used this physics trick as did the Ulysses solar probe.
But what has puzzled researchers for years is that the behavior of rockets is not 100 percent what one would expect from the ancient law of gravity.
Rather, there are irregularities in the speed.
The probes are getting unexpectedly faster or slower.
Physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They called it swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and he is trying to explain the swing-by-anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have constructed in the universe.
"Dark matter, which may be very close to Earth, could be responsible for the anomaly", he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It evidently emits a force of gravity, the effects of which can be observed on other heavenly bodies.
It is completely invisible, that is, it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists have calculated that dark matter makes up about a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt are to be released, the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded several million euros in ransom.
A shootout before the release is said to have killed six hostages.
In southern Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped.
I hear ransom negotiations are already underway.
German people are being targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE is the main case.
The European tourists who were kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arabic TV channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media in agreement.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports by Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health", said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian woman, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, were safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are said to be on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the abduction before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom", said the official.
It was "only a matter of receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers and arrested two of them on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The hostage takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, which was to be paid by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse by Stepfather "Leaded to Suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman's suicide, a court was told.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after pleading guilty to eight counts of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he regularly bound his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between the ages of five and seven.
In a confession, Trerise wrote: "I feel responsible for her death".
The court has learned that Mrs Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, aged 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had her handcuffed and blindfolded before he performed sexual acts while her mother was away working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was being persecuted for the abuse she was being subjected to twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been an avid surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "given up her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
It is believed that she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended: "I used to tie her up and blindfold her".
"I did not sexually abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death".
Judge Christopher Elwen said of Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrifying for your victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still, the fact is that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if she had not done so".
He added: "I am aware of the effect that Stephanie's father and mother described as having had on their daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would clearly have been a promising, successful, happy young woman".
Officials responsible for lost data are prosecuted
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official who lost top-secret documents on a train in June will be charged under the Public Security Act.
The man was a deputy with the Department of Defense when he lost two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It's the weakest charge in the law, and there's no indication of criminal intent.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action came as a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be handled internally at the Department of Defense and Cabinet".
The employee, whose name cannot be named, is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the secure storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor's Office recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he posted contained classified assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to a secret location.
Housing companies consider B&B costs
UK housing companies could face costs of more than £80 million after rescuing Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government has committed £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all the companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The general director of the Housing Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "intolerable" that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are paid off.
But the accumulated interest in the meantime is charged each year to those 700 financial institutions that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
The Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the proposal.
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
That means the companies will have to raise £81 million for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, the general manager of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions which behaved prudently during the housing boom are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions which were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since records began in 1945.
"We will be monitoring all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives are available to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs".
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September 2009 to the end of March 2009.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year and that could be almost double that.
Since construction companies are bilateral organisations with no shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk will be five pence more per litre
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence a litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations were carried out by a consultancy firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Prior to the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey Milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court denied bail on the charge of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several pending corruption charges against her.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, has demanded that the military-backed transitional government first grant her full freedom.
The correspondents say that although she was granted a stay of detention to go abroad for medical treatment, it is unclear whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the Supreme Court's decision.
"The High Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she does not need to be granted bail as she is already in detention pending treatment abroad", her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file a legal appeal against the Supreme Court".
Her lawyers argue that she needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami Alliance party chairman said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against them.
Concerns about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest polio campaign in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated because of violence linked to the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations conducted a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or impede the thousands of staff who were carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses its case against ITV
BskyB lost its action against the Competition Commission's decision to reduce its stake in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeal Court ordered BskyB to reduce its shareholding in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB's stake distorted competition and enabled it to exercise unfair influence over ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the stake in ITV by BskyB raised doubts about ITV's independence, which led the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin's boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom have all spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its stake in ITV was unreasonable and exaggerated, in particular because BskyB had announced that it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the US prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special investigator to investigate the 2006 dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys general.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, which criticized the actions of the administrative staff.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the lawyers had been fired for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy is now expected to determine whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators to obstruct justice.
Serious allegations, including criminal activity, have not been fully investigated or resolved, said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
One of his main recommendations was to appoint a special investigator with the authority to compel the witnesses to testify.
The conflict began when the Justice Department removed nine U.S. prosecutors from office in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed for poor performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to consider the dismissals to be politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of Democratic voter fraud.
U.S. prosecutors are charged with investigating and prosecuting cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but they may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Ministry, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the dismissals and eventually resigned.
A number of officials from the Justice Department have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report particularly criticized Gonzales' role in bearing "principal responsibility" for the dismissals, "abandoned" his leadership role and showing "exceptionally disinterest" in the process.
Other officials, including former President Bush's chief adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for their lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song is to be honored
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold award at the ceremony next week in London, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's awards, having been shortlisted in four categories.
Q Magazine editor-in-chief Paul Rees said there are some songs that transcend such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song, which was written by Jim Steinman, required a powerful voice, which was delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental piece that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979, reaching number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years on the charts and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, including an operation in 2003 for an irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute laryngitis.
It was later revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to be sold
New York City has thousands of major thoroughfares, avenues, side streets, and other byways, some of which are famous and others convenient.
Yet, even experienced taxi drivers and longtime locals find it hard to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is in the East Village and runs from First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It's 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, and it looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are no road signs.
It's practically impossible to find them on a standard street map.
This street has its admirers, though.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company, recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-paved Extra Place to provide a clean passageway to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the longtime neighborhood, who says they're fascinated by the short alley simply because it's one of the remnants of the block's past.
But the city administration, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and the road, has no interest in preserving them.
During a meeting of the city council's land use committee this month, representatives from the city and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the construction company to purchase the road.
However, the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager for City Council 3.
"There is very little space left in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to remain in the city's possession", she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure that public access remains guaranteed".
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it was repaving the small street and setting up seating, including for a cafe where the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay might buy the road was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the road, it did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this run-down street and turn it into a public meeting place", she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city's desire to sell the street, stressing that the department's job was to develop the properties rather than manage them.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historic appeal.
Some believe the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by none.
The back door of the punk rock monument CBGB, which closed in 2006, opened onto Extra Place, and the street is probably best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager who took the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of scrap, scraps, and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, and ropes.
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity  a virtually unchanged slice of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Dying City"), published a portion of the city's history conversation about Extra Place that appeared in "The New Yorker" magazine in 1952.
Writer Brendan Gill wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small, narrow alleyway that remains dark even during the day, marked by rusty metal doors in the warehouses, closed windows, and weekly newspapers flying past rain gutters".
With few exceptions, this is exactly what the street looked like one evening recently.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where a more expensive clothing store is now located.
Graffiti was visible on the walls, and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the street could be polished up a bit.
Fields added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the street in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: education in an English-speaking environment
In this edition of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior fellow in California Studies and senior director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Choice.
Addressing the Hispanic electorate is a complicated task.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's campaign notes that "black and Hispanic students are less likely to graduate than white students", which is true.
To close this achievement gap, Obama's education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition phase in education for those who are just learning English.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the achievement gap.
Take Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in East Los Angeles, for example.
The majority of the students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning English.
Yet, in 2008, an astonishing 100 percent of fourth-graders passed the state test in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of fourth-graders scored well on the English test.
This amazing success has been achieved by different methods than those favored by Obama.
Sixth Street School emphasizes checking and practice, constant checking of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
Moreover, the school is taking the approach of an English-speaking environment, which is exactly what Obama should be paying attention to, according to school principal Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasises the almost exclusive use of the English language in technical education.
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, and 12 months later you would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize him.
"It works", she noted, "it works for us".
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large share of Hispanic and other English-speaking students?
The school's performance would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within his own party (the national education associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about "English only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to close the achievement gap, he should carefully consider models of education that work, instead of dismissing and trivializing them.
Oil prices fall as concerns about the economy re-emerge
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid fears that even the U.S. financial-market bailout might not be enough to revive the economy.
The New York Stock Exchange's crude oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20 a share.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulence on Wall Street and by powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices have fallen to nearly $90 a barrel this month, only to rise again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Investors were again worried on Monday, even though congressional officials had announced that they had agreed to a bailout over the weekend that was to be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In what is the latest chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is to buy the banking business of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems to have failed to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to decline further.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank have written in a press release to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become highly uncertain.
We believe, they continue to write, that the commodity markets will also be affected.
"From a commodity market perspective, we are most concerned about whether the US-American virus is spreading globally, especially to China".
The Bank's analysts have revised downward their expectations for oil consumption for the coming year, due to weak economic growth, and have lowered their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Infield Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all after being in the Jets' jersey more times than anyone else in the last eight and a half years.
Then he watched the second quarter on Sunday, where the Jets turned a no-hitter into a victory.
"I've never seen anything like it", said Ellis.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which was in keeping with the bad weather, the second quarter began.
But when quarterback Brett Favre's pass came at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their evolving collaboration took a giant leap forward.
Favre found Coles in that quarter for two more touchdowns, one of which was a passing out and the other 10 seconds before halftime.
"I didn't try very hard", Coles says of the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a great player.
Our vote was a vote, no matter what people think".
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, defensive quarterback Kurt Warner was dispersed.
Offensive lineman Darrelle Revis caught an accidental throw and converted it to a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and grabbed it.
Linebacker David Bowens then took Warner to the loss.
The last ball loss forced on Bowens was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured it and Jay Feely converted a 20-yard shot to a 34-0 lead.
That was the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the insanity, Jets coach Erik Mangini replied, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answer both, because the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time".
Rested paralysis beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has once again shown why he is considered by some to be the best long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first person to complete the 42.2-kilometer distance in under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one world championship title or set a world record on every mile from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month, dyslexia caused him to miss the Beijing Olympic marathon, perhaps overly concerned that air pollution might worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in sunny conditions and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since the switch of long-distance runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya, the record time for marathon has fallen by more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with a 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his thigh two weeks ago and could not train for a week.
Apparently, he's refreshed after the break and not rusty.
"I'm so happy", he told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago and had some doubts today, but everything was great".
He has been criticized - particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world's top marathon stars, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records over the course of the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Bruges as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the midpoint of the race in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge dyslexia after the pace makers gave up.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final run to part ways with Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best time by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by setting the seventh-fastest time ever with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff of Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games due to problems described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has planned her run well, having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners start first, but overtake after 30 kilometres.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came in third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardship of the black population in a city of a very special kind.
Hidden among the lush lushness of Orlando's surrounding amusement parks, a few miles from the glittering, noisy, and gigantic bustle of the city, lies a quiet city where the pride and intricacies of African-American culture are on display.
Eatonville, the first all-black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, 3 croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison".
It's a pilgrimage site now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are here for the annual Zora! festival in Eatonville to honor the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city she describes  and which made her a tourist destination by including her in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project during the Depression  is and remains in many ways a place of a very special kind.
Eatonville is as independent, as poised, and as private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing".
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open debate on race relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told", says Hortense Jones, 59, a native of the city and a member of the city's oldest church.
It has to be true".
Eatonville has long been defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It's both a historic example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is both a literary stronghold and an example of the sometimes condemned, sometimes praised, black culture of the rural South, rooted in American slavery.
It is not surprising that the inhabitants of this place are both proud and cautious.
And so the concern about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as Hurston is known.
She introduced the world to her hometown in books written from the heart and in oral language, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Travel Guide transformed the city, which is located right off of Route 77, a road that runs through the often-forgotten center of Florida, into the setting of black history and human drama.
As brazen as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston Lear led the store to Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"On the left of the street", she wrote, "is the brown-and-white-painted modern school, with its manicured gardens and playgrounds, always tended by Howard Miller, who can hardly read or write".
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and what-ever fits in with classrooms".
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriages, and sex.
This was definitely not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were", said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added: "Some people didn't like it".
Hurtson is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came into town in a state of rage, she did so mostly without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that even today is somewhat fanciful of her venerable style of dress.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, but many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora", said Mr. Franklin.
"But she never stayed too long", he added as he rocked his chair on a back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary of Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
There was no big memorial service in Eatonville, no big public readings.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their legacy in the least", says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a 2003 biography of Hurston.
The turning point came in the '80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to build a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the community.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950's, the fight against racial segregation brought hatred to the community.
"At this time, a bunch of white boys would come and throw oranges and stuff at the people sitting out", Mr. Franklin said.
"There was even a woman who was killed in the process.
They threw a watermelon out of the car".
In 1955, Hurston, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, questioned the Supreme Court's demand to force integration by describing its decision in Brown v. Board of Education as "offensive rather than respectful of my race".
Residents today say that while the desegregation was positive in some ways, it weakened the group unity in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
"Black kids used to be hugged - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning and you hugged your teacher in the evening", says N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Protecting the Eatonville Community.
This could be maintained, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide", said Ms. Nathiri.
But civil rights helped make room for more Zora Neale Hurstons -- black writers, actors, and artists who overcame prejudice, as she did, with positive self-esteem and statements like, "How can anyone deny themselves the joy of my company!
I don't understand it".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set out to Hurston's unmarked grave and began her fight to revive her fame.
Five years later, a much-lauded biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway was on the bookshelves, making it once again part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community started planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the county could do with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the county turned its back on its road construction plans.
"The plans for a five-lane highway have brought the city to life, accelerated the process at top speed, and brought real civic pride", said Ms Nathiri.
Mrs Boyd put it a little simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the long-distance road project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
More and more tourists came, including Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending church here since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a distinctive Florida town, just six miles from downtown Orlando, and it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It's 90% black these days.)
Outsiders looking for the history and significance of Eatonville are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, prior permission is required, and certain items - such as the mural in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in the field - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, confident teacher with a penchant for dark red, are still afraid that their sheltered community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of homeland pride was also born.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, no worse, no better, and as proud, creative and industrious, silly and mixed up as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in city government or the police, who he says might need some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just drive through here will think, 'Oh, this town is nothing compared to all the others,'" said Alondra Kenon one Sunday after church.
"But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it's a very beautiful city".
Here in New York, we speak financial Latin fluently.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not even realize that they were in the middle of a debacle.
You would never believe that above their heads, in shoe-shaped offices with glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York City are having the worst day of horror every day since the stock market crash of 1929.
Suppliers still push metal tea bags along sidewalks with loud bangs and carry muffins-laden tablets for breakfast.
Latinos still creep between apartments like human pack animals loaded with about 50 folded T-shirts hanging from a yoke-like pole lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting at sidewalk food stalls for their breakfast bagels, and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, when I decided, because of all the doomsday talk, to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to put my due date on the quiet late afternoon at my JP Morgan Chase headquarters, there were already about 20 people in line.
Not the cash register for cash withdrawals or deposits, but the customer service counter where regular customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to Macy's department stores, and new customers open accounts.
Most of the people before me, I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with a license", were in line for the same reason I was.
But unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, in places they commuted from, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrift (a bit like a construction savings bank), co-operative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers like family.
In the last year, 15 of these banks have quietly gone bankrupt.
Over the past few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went into administration bankruptcy, and as New Yorkers drove home over the weekend last Friday, Wachovia, another bank with $440 billion in savings, was looking for a bailout buyer.
Fearing another collapse, the office and store workers who waited in line before me took their cash to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank that is responsible for most of the bailout purchases on Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have been getting their hands on a lot of liquid financial Latin in the last few weeks.
A woman who was on the phone in my Chinese supermarket was referring to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank and its skinny-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, with as much familiarity as if she were gossiping about a lazy coworker.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has moved on from our usual conversation topics about Brad and Angelina and my grocery delivery.
"I have all my savings in money market funds now", she told me after I visited the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any more risks".
Muslim graves desecrated during a right-wing slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a leftist from the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, representing the organization Cities Against Islamization.
They carry traffic sign-style signs depicting a mosque, crossed by a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend as far-right parties recorded significant gains in the country's parliamentary elections.
On the night of Friday morning, more than 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in Traun near Linz in what police say was an organized operation.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Star on some of the graves, but law enforcement officials believe this was an attempt to cover up the motives of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It's not clear if the incident is in any way connected to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the grave desecration, which took place as the Muslim religious month of Ramadan drew to a close.
At the same time, a round of conscientious objection is being held in Austria after the country's right-wing swing in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that won almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, which won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on headscarves and burkas and even expressed his dislike of foods generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets on the grounds that these are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted immediately after the election, which show that the far right is the most politically powerful bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities controlling him that he was going to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police were granted a travel ban last Thursday after they presented evidence of Glitter's criminal history in child sexual abuse cases.
Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford County Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court reported: 'On Thursday 25 September, Kent Police applied to Ashford County Court for permission to prevent Mr Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not present in person".
As required by the sex offender registry, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he intended to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police seven days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of up to five years.
Kent police said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent Police said: "Kent Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country and abroad".
"We think it's easier to control someone who's in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks".
"It is the Kent Police's primary concern to protect the citizens of Kent and we are working closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the country to minimise any risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for molesting two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong.
He was also denied entry by the Chinese authorities and flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted he return to the UK.
Finally, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge Crown Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for permission to require him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been jailed for four months in the UK in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
According to the Interior Ministry, Interior Secretary Jacqui Smith was reassured and pleased that Glitter had been prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
` I receive the master behind the scenes to capture his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no makeup, no costumes for the show.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers, who forgo concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find the gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or the expression of the hands that are worried because they're not going to step on stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', German photographer Günter Bauer presents a varied theatrical presentation of some stage productions with singers, dancers and guitarists, a side of which he was little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flamenco production on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of the month of flamenco photography, ` reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing day by day', explains the artist, making it clear that `Flamenco-people' ` can be anyone, but when you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
The very ordinary people in the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
Their personality and character is in their hearts.
What I was interested in was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture with my camera the characters of the greatest flamenco masters.'
In 1997, Bauer, inspired by the `Cante de las Minas' festival, set out on a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the camera's image sorting function and the material available, images were created that resemble classic photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving it the modernity and the idea of the farmer's understanding of flamenco: `Music with traditional roots, which changes and surprises every day'.
It is not just the dance, the singing or the playing of the instrument itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and has been the definite aim of this work, which will be presented in the near future in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Famous flamenco figures including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of the nearly seventy artists who were photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago and to make it a reality as 'portraits of sports veterans' (`SportARTproject).
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives to `es I really like to photograph people, get to know them and put myself in their state of life, whether for a short moment or for a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or run into people, personalities that you sometimes don't even know, or they leave you alone for a few minutes so you can take a picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to make my ideas come true.'
The collection of portraits of the flamenco of today, entitled 'Flamenco-people', is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata, parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he is writing is a foolish cowardice.
He doesn't know yet where the novel is set or what it's about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to push forward with the project he's working on right now, a novel featuring the protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for 20 years and moved to the Amazon.
Yesterday, during his attendance at the Hay Festival Segovia, the favourite Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is working on is 'a foolish cowardice' and 'everything indicates that he should not write the novel'.
`If I were sober, I wouldn't have done it, but I will and I hope to finish the novel someday', so he concluded his participation in the festival, where ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival's premium and was voted for by most of the attendees, is compared to the old version of `Our mutual friend' and is seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience who realized that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, had not been given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose from `exceptional adventure', from `joy in reading' and from `wanting to experience more than it appears; how he writes and `disciplines', to supplement `lack of inspiration, his intensive work with documentaries, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; how Faulkner, Hugo Víctor and Alejandro Dumas affect his vocation and what images are the most important elements that form the basis for his stories.
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that there is no way of measuring and knowing if books change lives, but I refuse to believe that literature is mere entertainment, a fleeting experience, stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it creates effects and divides people even more, so I asked the writers not to give in to lightness and to take responsibility for their vocation.
The weather did not play a part in the festival in Pozoblanco: bullfighting festivals were partially cancelled.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the festival was to conclude in Pozoblanco, was postponed to yesterday morning.
The organisers, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, have decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus the festival was suspended because of the unstable weather, which prevented two out of three celebrations from taking place.
It rained on Saturday, so the second bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The group of matadors consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullfighting arena.
So there was only one party on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed, after which he left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante hit two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had done more by galloping than by his bullfighting skills.
And worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without glory.
After he fought so poorly, much of the audience responded to his second fight with buzzing cries.
In Álava, two persons tried to evade control of their car, which was loaded with 2,000 kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow, five minutes to ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the municipality of Armiñon (Álava).
Two policemen urged the drivers of the car to stop, and they fled.
It looked like they wouldn't have to stop with a cargo of over 2,000 kilos of hashish.
Police pursued them and arrested one of the drivers, a 28-year-old man known as A.A.J., according to the Basque Interior Ministry.
The person arrested was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and were passing through the urban area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to conduct the route check, and the driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased his speed and tried to evade the check.
The police began the pursuit until the car stopped at the edge of the strip after a few kilometers, at which point the drivers got out of the car to flee across a country road into a forested area.
The police of the town of Ertzaintza finally caught one of the two, in a car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers were transporting 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front of the car was loaded with bundles of hashish, which were later sent to other police stations for detailed laboratory analysis and weighing.
The officials also found that the registration plate was 'duplicated', which meant that it did not match the registration plate shown on the vehicle documents, and an additional arrest was made for falsifying official documents.
The police of the town of Ertzaintza are continuing the investigation in order to arrest the second suspect, who, as mentioned earlier, managed to escape, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A.A.J. has been taken to a police station for questioning and will be presented to the magistrate in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear has been arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, best known for her role as Amanda on the television series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine that a Witness had observed her trying to get out of her car in a rather strange way in Montecito.
The witness described in detail that Locklear 'pressed the accelerator and made a lot of noise after 4:30 p.m. trying to move her car back or forward from the parking space, and as she drove back she grabbed her sunglasses several times'.
A little later, the witness, who at first probably didn't recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby road and get out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency services because she was afraid for Locklear's life.'
When the police arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was parked across the street, blocking traffic.
`They seemed to be disoriented', so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol centre to be tested.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was ruled out from the start.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance, which could not be determined, and taken to a local detention center at about 7:00 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic where she was being treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left be responsible for Silva's case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the VL's chief coordinator and United Left MP, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former city councillor for youth and sports of the Seville City Hall, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federalist and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to take responsibility,' Llamazares pointed out, pointing out the approach the party must take towards the one who has been a city councillor in Seville until now.
Nevertheless, the Chairman of the VL defended the need for `transparency' in the possible investigations into the violations that Silva might have initiated: `The VL always insisted that such cases be given maximum transparency'.
In this respect, he stressed that education has a strict code of ethics for all public offices.
` Sangre de mayo': book by Garci
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós's Episodios Nacionales, José Luis Carci's Sangre de Mayo is a revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French, an admirable film in the history of cinema, with approximately 15 million euros invested in the filming.
In this way, the cineast has tried to show a 'lump of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci said today at the launch of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, at the beginning of a long list of actors.
` Sangre de mayo', which is more than two and a half hours long, will be shown in cinemas this Friday and later on Telemadrid as a four-hour mini-series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós's literature, assures that thanks to this filmmaking, his childhood dream came true, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the Autonomous Community of Madrid to shoot a commemorative film for the celebration of the second centenary on November 2 in Madrid.
The total contribution of 15 million, provided by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for filming, offers Garci, he added, the unique opportunity 'to portray, with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing, the image of Spain in confusion, choosing the wrong leader for the struggle because the people had been left behind by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII'.
However, the Cineast regrets that funding could not be expected as in `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as in `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost all his career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also a film director in 'Volver a empezar', has contributed by his usual way of working: he has taken the stage to the actors with whom you have to rehearse first before you start shooting and to those who had not cast, he has appeared 'humiliating' and respectful, 'part of the job of a film director is to help in the theatre and in the cinema to know what is happening in the film industry in which you work'.
Many of the actors he encounters in 'Sangre de mayo' have to repeat themselves in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar nominee in four nominations (one of which he won), believes and assures that none of the three candidates representing Spain at the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmmaking: neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Siete mesas de billar francés' and finally neither the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci doesn't expect any awards for this film.
`At first you think you're working for the offspring, later you realize it's just for the growth, and now you're satisfied when you've produced another film,' explains Garci after more than 30 years in the profession.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who was also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: Her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and a supporter of the abolition of corsets, which restricted women's freedom of movement.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars.
` I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested the role, which I thought was impossible.'
`We are not trying to tell about her life without preserving her spirit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your basic dance skills helped me a lot in flamenco.
For example, the butterfly's dance seemed to me like Guajira, or the snake's dance like tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I've been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic realm,' she claims.
The production will feature two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in `La puerta abierta'; and with the flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with one of her former students.
Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature character.
I am happy that she has agreed to share in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The production also features musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with vocals by Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with percussion by El Pájaro, as well as viola by Rafa el Viola and collaboration with actor Juanfra Júarez, he `assumes the role of the companion of the artists who were divas, with whom he falls in love again and again.'
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
` I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who have had a huge influence on a certain era and whose works are no longer appreciated and therefore even less appreciated,' says Bayón.
The show is at 8:30 tonight at the Lope de Vega Theater.
The publication of the book Diario de un poeta recién casado also includes the Triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, provides the appropriate atmosphere for the planned activities commissioned by the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008), which is intended to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their deaths.
Thus, the Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, the international congress in New York, the restoration of the House-Museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and the traveling exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which opened in May and, after visiting various places in Andalusia, has now reached New York and will be presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso, with the aim of making the Andalusian poet's life and work better known.
The United States can 't imagine itself without Paul Newman .
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them".
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in Sensation Reporter, and from the then prevailing idea of American cinema, which was abandoned, from all over America until Newman came with his exciting idea and followed it.
Look what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, it was a big blow for everyone.
'What one feels sometimes is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford, weeping, 'my life and my country were the greatest nonsense of his life.'
No one was afraid to make a fool of himself or to exaggerate.
As the father of cinema and the fatherland, he died at a sad moment, when terrorists were feared and the market collapsed, when the depressed self-esteem of Americans was desperately searching for reasons to regain dignity.
If in these hard times, without virtue, there are few people left to admire, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he was a kind of Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered various losses as well as gains: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs, founded in honor of his son from his first marriage, who died of an overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift to a country where it took a lot of effort to push back against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of admiration is sweeping over Hollywood, regardless of nationality or citizenship.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man died, but the whole era.
English film director and Oscar winner Sam Mendes said that working with Newman was no more or less than the pinnacle of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'The greatest of us has left us,' said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to live as Paul Newman did: to be held to high standards of integrity, to lead a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
That's not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who is trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful, though there were certainly many possibilities of not being.
'Why would I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filets at home?' he often joked.
In heaven, he'll be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily the norm in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, none was more proud of him than those of faithful husband, loving father, caring grandfather, and philanthropist,' they say.
The roads in Madrid are deficient for the Olympics.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we're following the old ways, I say it's not true!
It was called the perfect street, and in my opinion, it was the worst street with all the mess it had.
Of course, that's a lot of nonsense, if you were to look at the evaluation and I could check it, it would definitely not have gone through.
But let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket hole that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me, but if they're going to let you go, then they should give you everything (including a chip to avoid traffic jams on the road).
I mean, no.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first nonsense is to go there just for that) and (after an endless line) there's the surprise! The T-shirt was only available in size `S' (a second nonsense, because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
Well, things like this are a trifle compared to the days on the road.
Besides having to go very early to get the chip, there's already a waiting line of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if we had succeeded once, but getting them back would be more difficult.
Also, during that 40 minute wait, it looked like rain, so there was a temptation to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think tomorrow, there's probably gonna be 500 people with pneumonia, and some of them, like me, won't even show up for the classification because of this chip I got, and I can imagine that the exit was wrong.
Of course, if you asked me about a perfect street, I'd never think of that one.
So I think we'll be dreaming for a long time about a city that's well prepared for the Olympics.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, an artificial intelligence entity without much intelligence, but capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a route planner to get around the company's campus).
Thanks to a camera and a shape and facial recognition system, this 'receptionist' can detect how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, she can listen and understand the key words of their conversation.
It can also classify the participants into groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, the receptionist notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group she is talking to and is not an employee of the company.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and replies that she will soon listen.
All without the blue screenshot.
It 's impressive .
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, like the next version of their Windows operating system.
This week, there was a very superficial talk about the change in Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have as many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the most basic stuff, instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would run five times faster.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added some functionality and `Extras' in Windows versions.
The Change Is Worth It
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome came online, it was part of the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many people have pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to function simultaneously.
The operating system performs the function comparable to that of his wife or husband in communicating to his mother-in-law.
That's right, I did.
The system will never go away, but you have to think of your death not as an absolute but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day we spend more time browsing than we do in the vicinity of the windows.
What is the purpose of half the applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 has to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
It's easier, less exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more in integrating its online services, which could eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, no doubt.
This is a picture of this place that I took in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees earlier this month.
The sign on the vending machine reads: 'Your search, our future' and asks you to use your own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google for their web searches.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not be published in early 2009, but in late 2010, rather.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility of launching Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 simultaneously.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio wore it in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, just like Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, and it's also part of the attire of a well-built priest.
If we start counting the countless star performances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man with a pointed beard who had lifted heavyweights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical men's cotton T-shirt, sleeveless and tailored.
The English-speaking world calls it a 'tank', but the 'L'Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles' is better than any other brand.
First, because of his great name, although in the narrow circle it is called `Marcel'.
`La Marcel' stands out because of its excellent cotton, its distinctive unisex cut and a small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag, which these T-shirts have as a detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company is not just focused on the production of `tanks'.
They also have college sweaters, retro boxers, cardigan and cashmere, cotton pants, striped T-shirts, babies, mini shorts.
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's a shame to use them as underwear.
You are very charming.
` I want to be a young mother; I'm not worried about the candidate'
Her big appearance with her sister didn't stop her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is a little bit of a girl, but she's full of life.
At the moment, the Gruz brothers are taking their new job in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, it means more than for some pretty rich girls who keep their reputations.
She was in Paris for the promotion of the company Mango, moved her residence there and also makes the presentation of the most important prizes in fashion, which the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short haul.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards and attended the dinner in Valentine's honour.
A very intense working time, but also exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season of Mango?
My sister and I are both fascinated by the cinema of the '50s and '60s; we find many ideas there.
I like to walk around a city and watch women dressed, combining their clothes, which I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, it all comes together and these areas have a lot in common.
Since I was a child, I was fascinated by clothes, and I always wanted to go to my grandmother's house and look through my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to look after the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in class and in rehearsals so we can look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
Finally, everything is connected, it's like, a lot of respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You just turned 30, you're not in a crisis?
Oh, what?
I feel better than ever. I feel good when I'm 30.
I think the woman is getting mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've been doing the things I've wanted to do since I was a kid, and it's given me a lot of inner joy.
So, are you thinking about becoming a mother or not?
I've known for a long time that I'm going to be a mother because my body demands it and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss it.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
I will bring my child great happiness and raise him with much love.
As for the art of filmmaking, you keep your eye on the works you've been involved in and shot over the past year.
That's exactly what they are, and I would very much like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' would be performed for the first time.
See how you like them.
A few days ago, you showed up on the runway with Naomi Campbell, is that correct?
Don't say that.
It's not like I went up the runway to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I've known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to attend a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show, and I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection have been auctioned for Mango to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There are many things said about her, and I, as someone who knows her, would tell you that they are not true.
I will nevertheless support the good cause in which she is involved.
She asked me to join the parade for this generous cause, but if she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is needed.
Drivers who may relapse because of the alcohol level will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The authorities order the driver, who has three official alcohol-related penalties, to install this system in his car, which prohibits him from starting the car while drunk.
The initiative was announced last June and is already part of the report of the Prosecutor General's Office, which says that it is a pilot project which will last for one year.
The purpose is to re-socialize the driver, who will then be given a course on the re-education of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Prosecutor General's Office, experience has shown that the Ministry of Transport and the Technical Institute for Automotive Safety Foundation will also be involved.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of drivers who have been booked more than once for drunk driving are driving again.
The 'alcohol lock' would prevent this because it is a system linked to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver has taken an alcohol test; or if a higher than permitted alcohol concentration is detected.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the cost being borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of violations within the first year of their introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be achieved by the usual means, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is called for, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is not yet available in any Spanish market, although it has been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The Commission has already taken the initiative to introduce a system of school buses, which has already been implemented in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes'
On British time, at 17:40 hours, the time scheduled by the programme, the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with the Prince and Princess of Asturias, landed next to the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez de México DF Airport.
The sun was setting, but its rays still forced me to use my hand as an umbrella to see the royal couple getting off the plane.
Directly on the gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very well, so, you can't pick people up at the airport at this hour.
No, she's the Spanish one, but she lived here a couple of years.
- Oh, that's very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and they know the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar and on the red carpet, including military protection from 27 Marines who are giving the oath of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long wind-swept hair, without ordinary `peep-toes', perhaps she has been informed that a storm is expected in DF.
Before entering the room, they smile and prepare for the photographers, where the official procession awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican TV reporter, who likes to joke, is waiting for them.
The best premium in fashion
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no more eminent fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' competition to promote and promote young fashion talents internationally.
The prize is worth EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the shop window of the Mango shop at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris yesterday and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest store in Europe and it was recently opened.
The biggest store is in London.
So many events have taken place that one would like to thank fashion designer Valentino for his chairmanship of the jury at the competition, which ended with a luxury dinner at the Opera National de Paris.
Surrounded by many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with a heavy heart broken by the pain of his brother's recent death, tore himself apart, wearing the suit of the fashion house and some stunning ELAH jewelry, holding his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall, and accompanying Valentino to the dinner in his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of the Mango House, greeted the guests and was so chivalrous that he ended up with the Baron of Red Shield without jackets, because jackets they lent to the ladies.
And then, as we were walking through the opera house, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, and she got excited, and she remembered the old days, and she grabbed a pole and she did a kind of "grand plie".
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we were delighted by the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always stirs a storm of enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, upon arrival (with his own bedspreads and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance for a room without odors.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, la la, that's the way of life.
1001 Counselling against stress
There's not a thousand, but one more way to forget our chaotic, fast-paced everyday life.
And if there are a few, they're all collected in a book that tells you how to relax, and it's coming to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm of life seems even worse.
The office is the tension and the computers that cause the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one or two methods to combat daily fatigue and the problems of disconnecting from the world of work.
The number will increase, however, no more and no less than by 1001.
Besides yoga poses, classic massage, and spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents a list of options that are tailored to each individual's taste and time.
The book is called '1001 ways to relax', and the calmness it brings is now available in bookstores at Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace of mind in such areas as the workplace through personal contact, this manual refutes that belief.
The method of keeping in touch with nature is also offered or the 100% natural recipes for relaxation are suggested.
When the adrenaline in your veins is no longer rising to restore balance to your body and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off your brain and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk at night
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk in their sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you'll be scared, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called sleep talking.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during a high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), and the next day the child may not remember anything.
There is no single cause for this phenomenon.
Often, people look for connections with other sleeping phenomena, such as nightmares, panic attacks at night, bedwetting, talking in their sleep, but there is no reason to do so.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be caused by high levels of fiber, stress, or overload.
In any case, it's a little-studied phenomenon.
The frequency of occurrence is highly variable.
It may be quietly speaking in single words, whispering, or it may be the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child be observed and consulted by a specialist to see if there is a problem that causes fear and thus occurs.
We said it's a positive disorder, so it's not being treated, whether it's associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, sleep apnea or stress).
What you can do is take a series of simple precautions:
Try not to arouse the child before bedtime.
So, choose quiet play for the child and avoid stressful TV shows that are awful and a little too wild.
For nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them to gain a measure of inner peace.
It'll help the baby sleep.
If you ever have a conversation in your sleep, try to stay calm.
Remember, it's harmless to the child, and the next day, he won't be able to remember anything that happened.
Helpful Advice
Don't wake it up.
It's useless, because the child is unconscious, so you'll pull him out of his sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if the child is frightened after a few apparitions, it is recommended that you seek counseling or find out what the reason for the child's fear is.
If they understand what is said (which is not so common), the child is not pressured into doing an interrogation and getting more information.
You will not be able to do anything with it, because when the child sleeps, he is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Also, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming or why it is saying it, so be careful about interpreting the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe it doesn't tell the child that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That's a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's not bad, it's a moment that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long drought, Illhäusern is finally back on the field.
Without much effort, the Yellow and Black played numerous chances and managed to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose shot passed just at the corner, Illhäusern should easily dominate the game, and it succeeded alternately first Fonderflick with a shot, then Brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of the foot, to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field, only letting the lively Riahi through at the head of the storm.
The start of the second half should be decisive with two goals scored by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illhauser by Marais, who was exactly right to take back a ball that had been defended in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the mischievous goalkeeper was not to enjoy his luck for long and was sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, forcing his teammates to continue playing outnumbered.
Denmark, however, did not know how to exploit this and did not face any major problems with an Illyrian team, which only retreated a little to tighten their defence, except in the very last seconds of the game, when the ball passed very close to the goal after a great mess.
Sarkozy hits angry fishermen with his gun
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another trip to Brittany.
In view of the determination of the fishermen who on Monday blocked the access to several Breton and Norman ports, the French President decided to meet their representatives at the Finistère in the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to welcome him in a constructive spirit and hope that he will come with concrete proposals.
The President's visit coincides with a general meeting of the crisis committee set up by the Breton fishermen to implement measures in the face of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record level of over EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again and to secure the working conditions and pay of the seafarers.'
Sarkozy is being eagerly awaited by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they led protests in Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams of almost 10 kilometres.
The Quiberon port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île were not interrupted.
The Quiberon Peninsula has been delimited by a barrier.
On Monday, the sailors showed their determination by burning tires and pallets in the early morning hours in front of the fuel depots in the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and in the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes in the Vendée, where the fishing boats did not go out, or Le Havre, where some 20 boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique region lifted the blockade of the important Total refinery at Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer delegation decided to wait for the meeting at the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reaction to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue, because the fishermen will not give in to any of the demands and will not go to Paris,' declared Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents a litre, but they feel that the margin of profitability of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents a litre.
Paul Newman the wonderful
The unforgettable "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" actor died of cancer at his home in Connecticut at the age of 83.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes said goodbye to the film legend and dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft to be delivered this year, despite the looming recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, is delivering on its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft delivered, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first six months, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer has high hopes for the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft with a size of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the American International Group, an insurance company that has received financial support from the U.S. Mint, is considering giving up more than 15 percent of its assets to pay back the $85 billion it was offered.
AIG is willing to sell a large part of its business, beyond its international life insurance and its retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation was obtained from AIG.
The assets from which AIG might divest include its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, its real estate assets and its private equity investments, the FT explains.
France Télécom continues that no final decision has been taken on these sales.
AIG must proceed with the sale as soon as possible in order to repay the loans of over 85 billion granted by the Federal Reserve, even at the risk of the US authorities receiving 80% of its capital and the current shareholders losing the same amount.
Analysis of the historical Paris of the meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to bail out the banks, a historic fall in prices: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The highest drop in points in its history (684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The final figures show that the Nasdag index, which is mainly concerned with technology, has fallen by 199,61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used Standard & Poors 500 by 8,81% (106,85 points) to 1,106,55.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the House of Representatives, which was supposed to restore some stability to the markets, Wall Street, which had already been in a state of collapse at the beginning of the quarter, collapsed.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to grant the aid to the Member States.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
`A bad image is being circulated here, which shows Congress as unable to adopt a plan,' said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market was counting on this plan', she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days ` would be too late'.
`If the project is indeed doomed to failure... it will quickly be up to the Fed and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would further restrict credit conditions,' warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And Mrs Piegza stressed, emphasizing the sense of urgency, that every day that passes brings about the ruin of a financial company in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the U.S. authorities were planning to buy the Wachovia banking business by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, an indication that markets are not facing an American crisis but a global one', the FTN Financial analyst added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenue of the State Treasury in ten years fell Friday evening from 3,632% to 3,827% and the revenue in 30 years yesterday evening from 4,161% to 4,357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first televised duel
The first debate between the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to determine who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs of both the Republican and Democratic parties declared their own victory in this televised duel, which was to be watched by one-third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, while quite impressive, was not brilliant enough to allow him to halt his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which on Saturday published a poll showing Obama leading by five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes the Democrat is clearly the better figure.
Among the undecided voters, the ones who matter now, Obama came out with 39% of the vote, while according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his opponent Joseph Biden in his first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts,' warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain never stopped emphasizing his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, and in doing so clearly underlined the naivety of his opponent on these issues which were the focus of this first televised duel.
'Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...' he repeatedly stressed.
'I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge to be president,' he added.
An attack that's been preached in Republican campaign ads since yesterday.
Obama himself emphasized that he represents the future.
He spoke briefly and accurately, without letting himself be confused.
He put his ability to make good decisions and to change the world's image of the United States in the spotlight.
McCain still hasn't understood, Obama has, a Democratic campaign joke was made against this this weekend, accusing Republicans of not having fully grasped the full scale of the crisis that is plaguing Americans on the streets.
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,' Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered in the pouring rain for a North Carolina election rally.
He did not even mention the words 'middle class' or 'workers'. ' The financial crisis gives Obama, whom Americans consider the most capable of saving the economy even on the brink of collapse, a clear advantage.
'The coming week could be a turning point,' said influential Democrat Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
The Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.'
After reiterating that he might even succeed in cutting taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that creating a potential energy independence for the country and promoting renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, were his top priorities.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully avoided the questions that surround the $700 billion rescue plan that was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
` Have you noticed that there was an election in Minsk?'
Youth and opposition demonstrators demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening in the market square of Minsk since polling stations were closed to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Despite the fact that no result had been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukashenko: `The dictator must step down'.
Some admit that they did not vote at all: 'What good is that if they can do what they want with my voice?' says one teenager.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-issuance of visas to 40 Belarusian leaders and the confiscation of certain assets, could be lifted if the election is judged clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
`We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the counting', regretted Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous coalition of 12 parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkiewicz, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because it matters who counts the votes, and in our case it is the executive.
If opposition members enter parliament, it is because they were appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament may mean television time, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because a dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, falls into a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a Russian protectorate.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been monitoring the election, will not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the voter turnout seems too high and that the extension of early voting (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
` Have you noticed that an election has taken place? asks the leader of the Social Democrats, Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners to be released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five opposition members in Parliament, those who are most in line with the government's ideas.'
The silence of the night descends again over the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
A Conversation - From the Blood That Became Safe Again
Hema-Quebec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, for Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And most important, it has regained the public's trust, which had been badly shaken by the blood-tainted scandal of the 1980's and 1990's.
It is well known that during the 1980's the national blood supply, administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Donation Service, was contaminated with the HIV and hepatitis C viruses.
In the face of this tragedy and public discontent, the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry in February 1994, headed by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances leading up to such a tragedy and to develop policies to prevent a repeat of this type of disaster.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to submit his report, several provinces then set up a committee to develop a new system for managing blood preserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society, to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
` In 1998, when Hema-Quebec began its work, only 38% of the people had confidence in Quebec's blood storage system, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through work in this area over the following years, we have regained the public's trust,' she says, before proudly pointing out that by early 2008 almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr Décary is aware that 'trust is a very fragile thing'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has been operating on the principle of prudence.
At the same time, we saw the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman who has been in charge since its inception in 1998.
And we had no idea that this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we refer to one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which is to apply exclusion measures when you do not know it and when a disease is only progressing slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself in brain degeneration, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999 no blood was accepted from persons who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was proved beyond a doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the precautionary principle that we have applied makes perfect sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NSTs), which allow the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in the donor's blood, rather than the presence of antibodies to the virus as was the case with previous tests.
The NSTs have shortened the incubation period between the time the person is infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
So the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and not be detected, has been significantly reduced.
These improvements have made it possible to reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS through blood transfusion to a considerable extent.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
` In other words, it would take 12 million cans of blood to get someone infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood can occur.
I believe that today you can feel comfortable getting or prescribing a blood transfusion to restore your health,' says the CEO of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next 10 years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogens might get into your system.
Only last year, the Chikungunya virus was discovered on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects through the blood.
We must monitor continuously,' continues Dr Décary, before stressing that Hema-Quebec must provide adequate care in addition to safe care.
` Demand is increasing as the population ages.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population is also affecting the blood donor network, which on average comprises only 3% of Quebec's eligible population.
Any healthy person 18 years of age or older who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On the average, 14% of those who donate their blood are rejected because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is common are excluded from donating blood for a year.
` With this 3% we can obtain an inventory which meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages of supplies are very rare.
But you have to replenish the members of this donor network when they get older and can't donate blood anymore.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but more importantly, to keep them and get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that it is rare to find time to spend an hour donating blood,' laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only canned blood but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is used almost exclusively in severe burn injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
Once considered biomedical waste, cord blood contains stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
`We celebrated the deposit of our 1,000th umbilical cord blood sample a few weeks ago, and we plan to take more than 1,000 a year.
'We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year,' explains Dr Décary, who describes this umbilical cord blood collection programme as very popular.
`Many mothers are convinced that they do not have access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly programme in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal Impact qualified yesterday, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders in the second and deciding game of the quarterfinal series at Saputo Stadium, which counted for the total goal ratio, for the semifinal round of the USL First Division playoffs.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute.
After a first half without a goal for either side, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who got in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember, in the first game of the preseason series on Friday, Impact had taken the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle, 2 to 1.
In the semifinals, Impact will face off against the Vancouver Whitecaps.
Saturday night, the Thunder were able to make up for a 3-1 loss in the Minnesota game with a 4-3 victory, but the Whitecaps still went into the semifinals with a 5-4 overall score.
Impact will probably face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be decided today.
In short - Victory by Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to kick off the season.
Last night, the unit made up of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn, launched a firefight against the Florida Panthers, resulting in a 3-2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass in this victorious game, the fourth of the Tricolores in six preliminary games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the entire shoot-out.
"I'm not ready yet", warned the Russian.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.
` He focused too much on it in the first half, Guy Carbonneau remarked.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a rousing applause.
Charest is set to the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the Liberal Party's general assembly was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected in today's by-election.
'Departing the course of our last great frontier to the north': this is the long-term objective that Jean Charest presented yesterday by visual means at the general assembly of the Quebec Liberal Party in Levis, following the guidelines in full.
During his talk, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
Three huge screens showed spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mining plants, Quebec as seen in Google Maps, maps, and so on.
Big money, like during the election.
The Prime Minister, by the way, refused to rule out holding the elections this autumn, even though he made it known that his schedule was very busy.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' the Prime Minister has supposedly for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area', which includes an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned frequently in the Prime Minister's speeches lately, the opening of the North - the northern area at 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, confined himself to explaining why the North was a 'jewel with enormous potential', but did not give a date, investment sums or precise priorities for the forthcoming projects.
At most, there are some prospects for more work: in particular in the field of hydropower, forestry, but especially in the mining sector, which is being helped by the growth of the emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to accept the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to chemical substances.
This area, twice the size of France, is nearby, in Quebec.
It is not only in our neighbourhood, it is in us', he stressed, as if to show clearly that he is seeking to realize a national founding dream.
He stressed that Quebec had grown greatly through its links with the North: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, James Bay.
'It is ours, it is our future,' he added, after taking a theatrical pause to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the premier told the press.
` This is a traditional attitude that all governments have had.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, and when the opportunity arises I will take this position again on behalf of the Government,' he said.
'We must rethink our vision of the north as climate change changes', he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will be open all year round due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister feels it is almost a duty to occupy this territory.
And the people of the area, the Aborigines and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful about dealing with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequino MP from Ungava), have already initiated consultations with some 30 communities.
A committee of ministers, headed by Benoît Pelletier, and comprising Julie Boulet (Transport and Mineral Resources), has started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large gathering, not necessarily a summit, but an opportunity to create a common vision.
The development of the North will, moreover, be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
Jean Charest described this vision as a continuation of those of the Liberal Prime Ministers who preceded him.
` Like the liberals who came before us, we have re-imagined how to turn challenges into new channels for growth and development.
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend which opened with a large cocktail party on Friday to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's leadership.
One of the decisions adopted provides for the renaming of the Beauharnois power station into the Adélard-Godbout dam.
` From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party has always known how to shape the future,' explained Jean Charest.
He referred to another, this time conservative, initiative, namely the 'Roads to the North' programme of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
As regards the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr Charest stressed that it was planned to be commissioned in 2012.
'This will remain with us, but I intend to be there,' he confided to his party members, which caused a storm of applause.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which he is allowed by law.
He stressed that his schedule was full, however, particularly because of a Community Council mission to China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The weekend's general assembly provided the Liberal leader with a platform of nationalist plans, particularly those concerning the Constitution, which were adopted without further ado: the PLQ particularly demands that the constitution acknowledge the specificity of Quebec.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council and to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
The guidelines of the Northern Plan were met with scepticism by the opposition.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has reiterated the policy for the development of the Nord du Québec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refrained from applying them.
If she had done so, we would have been much further along today,' said Mrs Marois, standing with her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the adoption of a Northern Plan by the Government.
'But what we want is not just a big show,' said party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from holiday today.
Letters - A disgraced country
It was Mr Vic Toews, the former Justice Minister in the Harper Cabinet, who last summer dared to say of Louise Arbour that she was a disgrace to Canada.
This woman, who has led an endless struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration, to cover herself with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which is the only one of all the countries concerned which has not brought home its fellow-countryman imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even consider that Omar Khadr was a teenager when the things that are being blamed on him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada is a signatory to the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier vegetate under inhuman conditions.
The only one that reduces itself to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are the main advocates for bringing Omar Khadr home so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that is also turning a blind eye to torture: it does not care that a young adult after so many years of suffering will surely be forever broken.
We do not yet know it, but we are witnessing a subtle curtailment of our rights, our freedom and our democracy, a word that Harper carries around like a flag and that sounds so meaningless coming from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: Canadians can be arbitrarily abused, tortured and imprisoned at the discretion of a government leader who is still supported by a minority (may he be a minority after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that their salvation lies in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they fail to see that this government has abandoned what has been the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this waiver, and nowhere else.
Free speech - the Orwellian speech by Barrick Gold
In its 17 September issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, deputy managing director of Barrick Gold, a Canadian gold mine.
This confirms, and follows an Orwellian logic, that the world's largest gold mining company sought a defamation suit of six million against three authors and a small, penniless publishing house, with the aim of opening a 'public, transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge on the truth, especially not in cases of defamation, but on the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to speak one of their opposing opinions.
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mines.
The tactic in these unequal battles is often to ruin the defendants in order to force a compromise that silences the other side and also discourages anyone who dares to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things to the public.
In contrast to what is commonplace in many of the countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada debates are usually conducted through the exchange of ideas rather than by sticking to sticks.
So it would have been enough if the goldmine had released its books and files and opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent review teams that could have shed light on this question.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have any faith in public opinion and is wiping out the petitions and letters in support of the writers of Noir Canada with a wave of the hand.
Mr Garver, could you explain how he can ask for a public debate and at the same time ignore the opinions of the public?
It seems that in the Vice President's world, that word only includes the well-paid lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a rather narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public supporting the writers and editors of Noir Canada is doing so primarily because they reject the brutal attitude of the goldmine.
This public is willing to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag suit (in the course of the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just issued a request to the authors of Noir Canada, asking them to stop using this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom to pursue academic research and the pursuit of truth, which are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to research and discuss topics that do not appeal to the rich corporations of the world, who else can?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the writers of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the academic world as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take action to limit this type of unjustified lawsuits.
The rescue of Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the top members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
The main contents are: improved control by the Members of the House over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public funds used, new provisions to limit the number of houses seized on account of late payments, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the managers of the assisted enterprises.
The United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-based,' said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
'Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street stock market crash,' the Democrat said.
'This is the basic point: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and turmoil in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,' said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had been accelerating for the last two hours, fearing the effect that a further failure would have on investor sentiment.
The deadline agreed upon was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who only participated late in the negotiations, appeared more in favour of the agreement, without failing to express their dissatisfaction at having to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the inclusion of certain provisions in the agreement, particularly those that would allow homeowners to keep their homes and those that would affect the salaries of executives of the companies rescued by the state.
` If taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain persons, this is not something to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary,' he told American television.
When asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I'd like to know the details first, but I hope so.
` The guidelines I have read show that this is something we will all have to digest and with which we can move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,' he said.
The $700 billion plan is designed to use taxpayer money to
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages before spreading to other forms of more diversified bonds (PCAA), and eventually resulted in a freeze in financial strength and the ruin of banks and monetary institutions.
It was a group of Republican lawmakers who failed the first attempt at a deal last week.
Since the Democrats accepted that certain toxic assets of companies in distress should only be secured by the government and not bought, it seems that the dead end has been escaped.
To round out the view for all in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to make a loss on this program within five years, it could then levy new taxes to recoup the capital it had invested.
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion, to which a further 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion must be approved by Congress in a second vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the companies it supports, which will bring him dividends in the event of profits, and which he can resell when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to suspend foreclosure proceedings in respect of the housing units linked to the real estate loans covered by this scheme and to set deadlines for repayment and the severance payments to the managers of the companies concerned.
The plan's developers would like the House to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, yesterday there were further votes against this proposal, both from the Republican and the Democratic parties.
'Very obviously Washington doesn't understand us,' Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that involves asking the taxpayers for cash.'
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, head of a congressional group called the 'Skeptics' Caucus, presents the situation differently but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to be pressured and to consider carefully which way to go,' he said yesterday.
At the same time, we were again getting evidence in Europe that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (US$ 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy out its competitor, which is in serious difficulty since losing €2 billion ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to risky mortgage lending in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and 10 largest insurers.
'This is not lost money,' said Wouter Bos, the Dutch finance minister, yesterday.
In exchange, we get a vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are looming.'
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank that had been hit hard by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all current loans from the Bradford and Bringley Bank, including over 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) in mortgage loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalised by the UK government since the start of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure blue eyes was long his trump card, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor, with his charming smile, freed himself from the narcissistic mirror?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably kept him from a position of power that would give birth to the truly terrible monsters.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died of lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch on Friday at the age of 83, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in its golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was a kind of rival on the screen for a long time, more careful in his acting, certainly more fragile, but equally an apostle of freedom and of the explosion of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio to a German-Jewish mother of Hungarian descent.
From his European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream was to emerge.
No excess ego, the highest quality.
Because he reflected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the fighter wounded in battle in the Pacific, who studied acting at Yale in the early '50s, and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success in theater, television, and soon, movies.
This very man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, and also a sex symbol, although he had been in a model relationship with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it, the unknowns of this mysterious, reserved, dedicated, and overly sensitive to the glamour of show business star, whose mysteries will never be fully solved, disappear.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman has left cinema lovers in shock as all his great roles are played out on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in constant flux passes with it.
Then comes the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Tin Roof, filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It evokes a much shorter past memory (1990) of his sensitive Mr Bridge, who is disturbed in his old age by a wedding that did not fulfill all its promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role originally intended for James Dean, was resumed after his death and made the Newman 1956 a household name.
This sympathetic villain in the stunning The Sting, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's wonderful The Hustler (1961),
That face through the ages, that was him.
Still him.
His resume is a collection of eras.
He is best known to young people from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen Brothers.
The circle was closed in 2003 with a final role as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition.
Unlike several movie legends who retired from the world of cinema early enough, Newman was to remain in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his wealth, his pomp and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the `Underplaying', when he judged his overly expressive performances.
The job wasn't always easy for the handsome Paul Newman, who had a long time of flying the roles.
However, he rarely played sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, scumbags or desperate, whose perfect portrayal reflected his slippage and rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensibilities.
His 1968 Rachel, based on the novel by Canadian author Margaret Laurence, with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle portrait of a woman full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to him, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
In the flood of accolades poured out yesterday for Newman, his close friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had starred together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared with great emotion: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and a spirit of life were essential qualities of the late actor.
Aside from his legendary career, there's also a great champion of civil rights, environmental protection, independent filmmaking, and an opponent of Hollywood's decadence.
We have often seen him with his foot in bowls of vinaigrette, in sauces, in pastries, or in other foods, and we thought that this was rather tasteless, although we still found it amusing at first.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed to his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: "Always and to the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.
And it was an honor for us to follow the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zürich &amp; Co.?
On October 8, the trial of János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The defendants are charged with involvement in organised crime, gross negligence in damaging and defrauding businesses, and other criminal offences, including forgery of documents.
According to the prosecution, the funds obtained from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often covered by false invoices.
State funds and grants from the local government - a total of HUF 65 million - were partly paid into the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation and partly into the coffers of private individuals.
The investigating authorities stated that fictitious invoices were presented for the tender money and that the clubs had not fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were forged.
The bills were bought at the market in Józsefváros, and the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was made on that round trip north of Lake Platten, to which István Lados was sent by János Zuschlag.
During this "exploration tour", Lados was to locate guesthouses and restaurants.
He requested invoices for consumption in order to be able to issue later invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Budapest Municipality based on these models.
These bills are said to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who, according to our information, was responsible for the preparation of the relevant reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer hall.
According to two invoices issued by Zuplag and Co in 2003, the catering establishment was supposed to have hosted the 90-person group of Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the head of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant all at once.
Another invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious errors of form and content.
A boarding house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at a time, is said to have had 130 guests, according to the bill.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was also apparently unlimited in the case of Pigal Kft., a catering company whose accounting records do not even show up for the clients Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá, according to the prosecution.
According to the manager Győző Farkas of hvg.hu, he immediately realized that the documents were forged when he was presented with documents by the prosecutor's office during an interrogation.
"Our company name and tax number were misplaced on the stamp".
Furthermore, apart from formal errors, it was also incorrect to say that the establishment accommodated 100 persons when it has eleven rooms in total, which cannot accommodate so many persons.
The bill also stated that the restaurant had been closed for some time.
The prolific counterfeiters also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted only offered travel abroad, and so they listed Hungary travel on the cash-only invoice, which was also contrary to the company's accounting practices.
As the investigation revealed, they also included VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services to a country outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
The amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the establishment charges only 15 per cent VAT instead of 25 per cent, and the employees issue only machine invoices, but the documents are handwritten.
Another mistake made by the "accountants" was that in one case they had indicated "transport of goods" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the firm specialising in investment advice, the prosecutor's office said.
Further formal errors - incorrect invoice format, incorrect stamps - were responsible for the fact that the invoices issued by Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont were exposed as counterfeits.
The same is true of Ravenna Bt. and Kunfehértó sports warehouse, whose managers claimed that they never issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" was made by the forgers at HIB Kft. in Nyíregyháza: this company was in the process of being dissolved at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was said to have eaten there - the mass manager therefore stated that he did not issue the invoices himself.
Intentionally Forged
The other group of accountants are people who were fully aware that they would have to make fictitious bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Ltd. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is also in liquidation, is also alleged to have cooperated with Zusslag and Co. In 2003, the GmbH allegedly supplied the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület with false invoices totalling HUF 5 million for non-performing services.
However, there was also little payment traffic, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, which the persons concerned forgot to mention in their documents.
The third group of accountants comprises persons directly connected with the defendants.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the mailman of the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based but untraceable fuel and vehicle trading company.
It is alleged that this company issued several invoices for the sale of computer components, totalling approximately HUF 18 million, between October and December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The manager of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Ivan Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted to issuing invoices on behalf of GmbH to the Atlasz and Hoppá associations and to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and to having collected the equivalent of the invoices himself.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were allegedly founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
In reality, however, none of these firms were active, which according to the defendant was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his partner, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was in charge of preparing the company's constitution documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is alleged to have issued 15 invoices totalling HUF 14,2 million to the organisations on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecution believes that Kubatov may have collected 10% of the invoice amount and VAT.
Kubatov is even alleged to have misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were attached to Biztos Pont's applications.
The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ('TMA'), in January 2006.
Both received 500 000 forints each, but misused these amounts.
To cover this up, they submitted to TMA five fictitious invoices from Works Team Kft.
These bills were, incidentally, secured during a search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
The proceedings are now expected to be followed by a confession by some of the defendants to the proceedings of the forgery of accounts, as they had already been made before the prosecution.
It could be a sensation if the main accused, János Zuschlag, decides to make a full confession.
His previous statements have been less detailed, and although he has already promised several times to report on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question therefore remains whether this is in its interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with it for the compensation of the bulk of the HUF 50 million of damage caused and whether Zuflag is willing to assume responsibility in return.
It is possible, however, that Zuschlag is now playing the "offended" role after his pleas for mitigation of detention and house arrest were met with deaf ears.
While other criminals who have caused far greater damage by committing economic crimes and have not compensated for it are free, or at least under house arrest, the Supplement is denied this possibility.
The psychology of oversupply - or why we're willing to pay more
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the items offered.
Neurologists and economists at New York University have now succeeded in discovering the neuroeconomic basis of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the journal Science, people do not want to be outdone in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even exorbitant prices.
Researchers have tried to explore the neurological pattern of this "game" by experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was asked to play a lottery, while the other was asked to participate in a gambling activity - in both cases, the active regions of the subjects' brains were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, participants were able to win money, but increased activity of the striatum, a complex located below the cortex, was observed in losers of the auction, where outbid is a key factor.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore considered that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
To support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also conducted research on the tracking of money.
In this case, three groups should bid against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was told the true value of the product, and then they made their bets.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward in case they emerged as winners of the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which would have been lost in the event of a losing game.
So the only difference between the two groups was that one group was focused on winning, while the other group was focused on losing.
But as proof of the hypothesis put forward by neurologists, members of the "against-losing" group were willing to bet higher than those in the "win" and "control" groups.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
The Commission has also been able to provide a number of proposals for the future of the European Union, in particular to the Council and the Commission.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved by the imaging neurological processes, so that we now have a third explanation", said Andrew Schotter, professor at the New York University School of Economics.
Hepatitis: When should you see a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is listed as one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 are treated, which is because patients often do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - hepatitis and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases are different.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E, they can be transmitted through the digestive tract (e.g., contaminated food or water); in hepatitis B, C, and D, they can be transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids (e.g., semen, vaginal discharge, or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to be vaccinated against the A and B viruses, but there is no vaccine against the C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.
After that, the skin and eyes become yellowish, the stool becomes light, the urine dark, and recovery may take up to two to three weeks.
Worldwide, about one million people die each year from the more serious diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people is on medication.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know they are sick, since the pathogen is subtly destroying liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention, such as regular controls, is essential.
There are three groups in which this condition is more common: those who received a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooers.
Currently, the number of people worldwide with chronic hepatitis C is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory test, it is advisable to consult a family doctor at the first sign of unknown origin.
If caught in time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby reducing the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
The 30th September is World Hepatitis Day, first celebrated in 2004 by patient organisations worldwide.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of this chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, its origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
Recent research shows that religious faith acts as a kind of "painkiller" that has already facilitated the deaths of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment to see how belief in God affects the way people feel pain, reports Britain's Telegraph.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 religious and atheist individuals were each electrocuted while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
The results showed that the believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Using brain-scanning technology, it was even shown that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The study was the first in a research project involving scientists as well as philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
In the experiment, the subjects were attached to their left hand a sparkling device that gave the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: one, a 17th-century picture of the Mother of God by Sassoferrato, and Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with Hermeline".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a kind of religious trance among the faithful, while they chose Vinci's painting because it was hardly different from the other painting and was felt to be soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time they received a total of 20 electroshocks in four stages, while they were either looking at the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported feeling "safe" at the sight of the Mother of God, as if "concerned", and feeling "peace and quiet".
When viewing the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than when they were looking at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that you could produce similar effects with other powerful images even in atheists, just by finding the right photo.
"We would have to find an image that evokes very positive feelings, like a mother or a father", says the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practice of faith should change our personality, and in many cases it does", Wright said.
After these excellent results, the question remains, what effect would a Madonna painting by Leonardo or another similar painter have on the pain regulation of the faithful?
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary produce even better results?
You are what you say you are
On its tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim that it is in people's pockets as well as above their heads: it knows where people have spent their holidays, which doctors they go to, and what moves them.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the CEOs at Google.
And he's telling skeptics who are plagued by Orwellian horror visions that they're just missing the essence of Web 2.0.
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt said that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, thus moving closer to the company's original goal of "ordering all the information in the world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years of changing the world, Google was still in the early stages of gathering information.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google could answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job is really right for me?" but that software programs were not yet able to do so because they did not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches, the search terms are recorded, as are the IP addresses from which the searches were made and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save their own search history and to use it later, so that the results can be generated much more accurately later, and the same logic is used for the so-called "Recommendations" which recommend tailored products and services based on previous preferences.
But users are wondering what happens in case of data abuse - "If you look at what I do" - some are worried about Google's data monopoly.
But in most cases, it is the potential power represented by the company that is the fear-inspiring factor, and not the guilt or fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or the rebellion against power that many Internet users find repulsive.
However, it is a well-established fact that the search terms are not only stored but also, if necessary, passed on to third parties, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was the recent crackdown on pedophilia in Brazil, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information gathered from the community site called "Orkut" and also allowed the identification of pedophiles.
However, privacy-conscious users were still breathing in May when Google and civil rights group EFF successfully sued the FBI: so no provision in the Constitution can force Google to release information to the FBI on secret request in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms in reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, but has been deprived of the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list retroactively for two months.)
Google's image remains controversial: those who are reluctant to release their personal data for fear of losing their privacy by using Google services are lashing out at the company with the indignation due to companies that present themselves as conservative.
However, the American "geek culture" which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users sees in them the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs", in contrast to Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require user identification codes and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and software package seems far more attractive, youthful and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, geeks are blindingly ignoring the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has come to the forefront in recent years, especially thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, that is, users intentionally leave traces and use the available channels of communication, and even if the scale varies individually, the main thing remains the same, which is to show themselves publicly.
The average teenager can manage their profile on multiple community portals at once - from Facebook to Xanga, connect it with other services like Twitter, or music services like last.fm, and finally integrate it into a tracking system like FriendFeed or Blip.fm. They can also run blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries posted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a series of other examples prove it: looking at the party photos from the night before, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful boyfriend was having fun with, or the employee gets fired for overly honestly expressing anger about the company's management on his blog - one thing is for sure: The term "privacy" has been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever lives online is what he gives away - that is the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even to circumvent Google's monopoly, is happy to do so -- like with Scroogle, a tool that, while it accesses Google's search engine, intentionally leaves no trace.
Many people do not register on community sites intentionally so that they cannot be found, but Google's online applications, such as word processing and graphics tools and RSS feeds, can also be circumvented by alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible user profile.
Meanwhile, the public is waiting impatiently for Google to reveal its true face.
At its current value of $156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space is threatening the revenues of advertising agencies, and the ever-faster introduction of services is preparing to break the heads of not only Microsoft but also other software developers.
Critics, however, also find the opposite worrying: for example, the company's management completely rejected a protest by employees after the company's own kindergarten fees were doubled, and the management also thought that the multiple meals for employees were too expensive.
The company's internal policy is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only when it is already available.However, events in the coming months and years could have a major impact: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning or archiving project is now reaching a stage where the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the "Health" system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database is already providing the material for the next generation of science fiction writers -- like "Scroogled", Cory Doctorow's famous novel, which describes in the best Orwellian way a future in which a human being becomes terribly approachable thanks to data obtained from Google.
Two teenagers help the double murderer of Ózd to clear his tracks
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now questioned two teenagers who are suspected of helping to clear the tracks, the spokesman for the Borsod police commissioner's office said on Tuesday.
The young people have confessed, and they are now being charged with aiding and abetting.
According to the MTI news agency, the girls are defending themselves in the open.
The aid is punishable by imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect in the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under suspicion of having murdered several persons out of greed for money.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect, however, did not want to pay his debts, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor to a plot in Ózd, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the man planned the murder long ago - this is also proven by the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene.
The police are now investigating the murder weapon and the circumstances of its use, together with experts.
Warsaw exchange offers to buy Prague exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered around EUR 200 million, or CZK 5 billion, for the purchase of 100% of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that they had previously been excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is wholly state-owned.
The Polish State holds 99% of the shares, but intends to sell more than 60% of the shares in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily newspaper E15, the Polish bid is the highest ever offered on the Prague Stock Exchange.
The paper reports that so far, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have all made bids.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25% stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5%.
The financial crisis in the European press
In their comments on the growing international financial crisis, several leading European newspapers on Tuesday already spoke of a "second September 11".
The global financial disaster is the American president's fault, La Repubblica said - the president was not even able to get his own party behind the bill, one that should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11".
Parts of the Madrid press are also locating the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is responsible for the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is in danger of collapsing, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy is in the air, and this is happening at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored, says the Geneva newspaper "Tages-Anzeiger".
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the financial interests of the Member States.
But if a domino effect is triggered and more banks fail, then neither more financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to step out of their shadows and centralise control of the money markets.
More than EUR 100 billion was paid out to failing financial institutions on Monday alone, the newspaper recalls, adding that fears are growing that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers will now have to dig a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
The EU has so far not seriously addressed the crisis that is sweeping the old continents like a tsunami.
While the "saviors" might not have to "swing" several hundred billion euros immediately, it would be wise to note in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money to avert even greater damage.
Smart cars mimic the flight of the bumblebee
What better way to develop new technologies for accident prevention than to imitate the obstacle sensors found in nature?
The bees, for example.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented, where Nissan engineers were inspired by Hummel to create new accident prevention systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C car-robot-controlled biomimetic system, a mini car with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of helping to develop a system that avoids all collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The bee's compound eye, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
To mimic the function of the compound eye, the researchers took up the idea of laser-controlled distance measurement.
This detects obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view within 2 metres, calculates their distances and sends signals to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of a second, and the robot car immediately changes course, similar to the movement of bees, by turning the tires at the appropriate angle.
Unlike previous systems, this is purely instinctive.
"If it were not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles", explained Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, since this technology is the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered inevitable.
The whole process has to reflect the behavior of the bees when they avoid other bees.
And that has to happen in a split second.
However, unlike bees, the evasion cannot be up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the rotation of the tires.
While the bees here have an infinite number of ways to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use only the rotation of the robot car, or acceleration and deceleration.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries which are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and respond to them accordingly.
It doesn't have to store them, or to produce an intuitive, logical response based on previous maneuvers, so it only uses a handful of KB of memory at a time.
It doesn't need gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology which Nissan estimates will be in series production within the next ten years.
Another application could be GPS satellite navigation, which deliberately guides the driver around obstacles and leads him to his destination.
A Name for the Sinful Child
Now we have the written version of the $700 billion bailout bill, which will be implemented in several stages and is aimed at buying up bad credit from banks.
The first round is to spend half the money.
In a session that ended after midnight on Saturday, East Coast time, lawmakers reached a deal on the $700 billion bailout after days of debate, Reuters reported.
"We have made substantial progress", said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying the deal needed to be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson said that the program will work and it will be efficient, but there is more to do, and Pelosi said that it is not about saving Wall Street, but about pulling the rudder of the economy.
The written version of the package was released before the Asian markets opened, i.e. Washington Times Sunday evening at 8 p.m. (Central European time Monday at 2 a.m.), but it did not trigger a bull run on the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives votes on the 2008 economic stabilization bill, and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made tonight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The programme, however, deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush administration that the $700 billion be spent all at once on the purchase of lazy, credit-laden securities.
The first tranche is to spend no more than half of the $700 billion, with $250 billion immediately available after Congress votes on the cause, as expected, on Monday, to be spent on the purchase of credit-laden, bad securities, and the remaining $100 billion to be decided by the president.
The program is reviewed by a separate committee, which includes the president of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision by Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury can also use a combination of tactics: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-backed securities, or other "toxic" loans.
According to the Ministry's officials, the purchase can be done either by auction or directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the funds of concern and the companies pay the fees corresponding to the expected losses.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the funds needed so that up to 700 billion dollars can be made available as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether it be for the large-scale purchase of bad assets, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a major financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law once it is signed, Paulson said.
However, the heads of the banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect their clearance, known in overseas slang as the "Golden Handshake", to be cut by the government.
The Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid, but it has decided to make a proposal for a regulation on the aid to the steel industry.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry buys through an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the former bank chief is retired.
In the event of a direct purchase of bad loans, the government will be aggressively involved to ensure that the salaries of managers are not overstated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake agreements will not be changed - the restrictions will only apply to new agreements so that more people can participate in the program.
This is the first time in American history that cuts in executive pay have been regulated by law, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, commenting on the measure.
The State gains shareholding rights in the participating banks, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, who can also participate once the economy and thus the rescued bank are better off.
The bill requires the president to submit to Congress a proposal over the next five years to help taxpayers recover money lost in the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American people expect us to do, the plan does not protect taxpayer money, says California Republican Darrell Issa.
His Ohio colleague, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were being pushed by the same people who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise

Due to price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices increased only slightly, i.e. by 0.1%, compared with the previous month.
The sales prices of manufacturing also rose only slightly - 0.1% - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8%) - primarily for bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6%, and for shoes prices rose by 2.5%.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials drove prices for chemicals and manufacturing considerably higher (1.6%).
Price declines were recorded in crude oil processing (1.4%), electrical and technical equipment (0.9%) and slightly in wood processing (0.1%).
Prices in papermaking, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of manufacturing, price increases were recorded between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the main domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water, prices rose by 0.3% in August, mainly as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
If we look at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in comparison with the previous year, the prices in the crude oil processing sector have risen the most (32.4%).
The metalworking sector saw an increase of 13.2%, while the increase in the manufacture of food, beverages and tobacco was 11%.
Price declines were observed in the textile industry (2.5%) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3%).
The rate of increase in prices in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6% and 9.1%.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2% last year.
Prices of electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent year-on-year.
On the domestic market, the highest price increase was recorded in August in the capital goods sector (0.7%).
In the manufacturing sectors, prices for consumer goods rose by 0.3%, while in the energy and processing sectors they remained unchanged compared with the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and reuse sector (16.8%) compared to the same period in 2007.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, prices rose by 6.8%, while in the capital goods sector prices fell by 1.4%.
The export prices of industry, measured in forints, rose by 1.1% in August compared with the previous month, but fell by 3.9% year-on-year.
The domestic currency weakened by 1.7% against the euro and by 7.1% against the dollar, and compared with August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and by 15.9% against the dollar.
No more visas to the U.S.A. from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances for the US-Hungary visa agreement to come into force around 12 January, as the Foreign Minister told representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, 'everything now depends on the timely introduction of the electronic immigration or control system abroad'.
The Commission also stressed that the new system would not allow entry, but would require tourists to register in advance.
The Hungarian foreign minister is holding talks in Washington from today.
She will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will present her with the "Middle Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she will also hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain back the bank bailout
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two major American presidential candidates, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout of banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians who are demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
Congress and government officials announced Sunday morning, after days of marathon consultations, that they had reached an agreement on the bank bailout.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thaw in the frozen credit market, became central issues in the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than their opponents at leading the country out of the economic crisis.
Recent polls show that Obama has been able to continue to build his lead on economic issues, while McCain's high, which gave him the presentation of Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin at the Republican convention, has also melted away.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also included those passages on consumer protection which he had supported.
"We must act now, and responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened", he told an audience of 35,000.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic visions "obsolete".
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We're all going to have a hard time with that . . . but not doing is definitely not an alternative".
The Republican senator said the plan also calls for the establishment of a control commission for the finance secretary, as well as limiting clearances for top executives, something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no definitive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the secretary.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press conference of the German-speaking Community
The right-wing is intact, only the voters have become more confident within the camp - this is how Der Spiegel comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (mirror.de)
In the online edition of the left-leaning German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article "Bavaria's Revolution Is Destroying Their Fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have been renewing Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
The breakdown of the epoch is a problem for Christian democracy as well as for Angela Merkel.
The CSU did not, surprisingly, suffer a disaster, but something that had already been happening for almost exactly ten years had come to an end on Sunday: the unquestionable hegemony of a state party.
The Commission has also been able to make a number of proposals for the reform of the CAP.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the much-cited Stoiber era.
The modernization systematically pursued by the CSU in the Federal Republic has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
The social scientists had predicted this 40 years ago, but the pace of the change was much too slow, but the effects of secularization, educational success, and the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not be ignored.
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with the multiplication of options, and that has political consequences.
The right-wing is intact - only the voters within the camp have become more critical and wayward.
It is striking that in recent weeks, it is precisely the traditional groups of citizens who have expressed the greatest distance from the CSU: the liberal professions, the industrial bourgeoisie and voters with a high school or university degree.
The support of the CSU has fallen to less than 40%.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily, in its article entitled "Who with whom? Party leaders with restraint on coalition issues", reports on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖs to interfere in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens are not yet ready to decide on a coalition.
The new elections are over and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders barely looked at their cards.
The Socialist Party leader Werner Faymann reiterated his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible - this is already the case in some Länder and in the social partnership.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP leader as Vice Chancellor, was left open by Faymann.
He said the voters had turned down the Schüssel-Molterer course.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal.
However, Molterer has been cautious in responding to red offers.
He said that cooperation could not be fruitful if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party will go into opposition or into the coalition is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed within the ÖVP.
BZÖ chief Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take government responsibility", said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which will be hosted by France, the EU's Presidency, has begun in Paris today.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, MEP for Fidesz, the European People's Party, drew particular attention to the issue of educational segregation, which is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children and the biggest obstacle to their validity.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants included representatives of governments, the European social partners and the most important European legal and civic organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the Fidesz MEPs' press office, Járóka has pointed out that apart from discrimination in job search, Roma are being excluded from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youths do not have a secondary education, and because of poor primary education, only a small proportion of them can obtain a university degree".
Járóka further stressed that education is a fundamental human right which has a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children could boost the economies of EU Member States.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the following categories of measures:
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income and turnover taxes, he contributes to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, the right to quality education for Roma must be guaranteed - the poor and segregated education must be stopped", says Lívia Járóka.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the following categories of measures:
'We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic possibilities to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,' Járóka said.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the promotion of the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level, in the spirit of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities'.
CSU: Mercy for the time being
At the end of October , the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided .
Despite the election debacle, no heads are still rolling, and the personnel debates at the top of the Bavarian CSU have been postponed.
The question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the Tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent vote loss will be decided at the last weekend of October at the extraordinary party congress.
The highly trained duo had already made it clear that they didn't want to stick to their seats.
The aim is to appease the angry faction and the party base, which demanded personal consequences the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the height of his career, the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has only secured 43.4 percent of the vote.
The CSU has been the "sole ruler" in Bavaria for 46 years, which generates 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
The Conservatives will remain the dominant force in the southern part of the Federal Republic, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but they will have to govern in a coalition.
As the first sign of the party's internal restructuring, the potential successor to Huber, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, is also included in the exploratory team, which conducts exploratory talks with the liberal FDP, respectively the right-wing "Freien Wähler", about a possible Munich coalition.
It is an irony of fate that with the "Free Voters" list, Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-dust appearance was first exploited by the Huber-Beckstein duo to then mercilessly depose the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now focusing all their efforts on stabilizing Beckstein.
The former prime minister and CSU chairman called 28 September the 'bitter day of his political career'.
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks towards the CDU - he felt that the CSU deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has also contributed much to the success at national level in 2005, is not restored by a joint act of force, Merkel cannot become Chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a secret of her disappointment at the fiasco, believes that the loss of ground of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to accept the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to chemical substances.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko is opposed 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no opposition MP got into the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers say this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects irregularities in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
The legislature of the 10-million-strong state has been without opposition for decades, but the opposition party, which met under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections, has been hoping that Lukashenko, who won his fourth presidential term in the 2006 election and a constitutional amendment, will "allow" some opposition members to sit in parliament.
That is why the ODS has even abandoned the boycotts that were planned earlier.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent on Russia for natural gas imports, with loans even being taken to alleviate price increases, and the country has also agreed to sell Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline that runs through the country, to the Russians.
The OECD Election Assessment Report, which focused on the positive developments rather than the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of one third of opposition candidates from the elections, provided a temporary respite.
However, the OECD's Rapid Report already on Monday criticized the campaign - meaning that opposition parties are unlikely to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the counting of votes.
Despite this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, for example, and Minsk is even prepared for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse to recognize the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on paper, has been considering the two areas as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun", Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
The opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections said that a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have become afraid to let even one opposition member into parliament".
The opposition is not planning any protest measures in view of the results, but is rather trying to make clear to the voters the need for economic reform.
"We have many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting stones in the way of distribution, but nevertheless I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even the elderly", Milinkevich said, alluding to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agree with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the creation of social security.
"With the country's debt and the growing trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the 'social security' that resembles the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble", Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Ria Novosti news agency: "People believe in deeds, not words". The absence of opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is served before work".
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are revolving doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
The Commission has already taken a decision on the proposal for a regulation on the protection of workers' rights in the event of a breach of the rules on the protection of workers' rights.
The new 'Anti-Lazy Act' was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
"Swinging doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through higher attendance and more services", said Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new era of accountability and transparency.
This is reformism", Brunetta underlines once again.
The Palazzo Chigi will be the end of the occupation of all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says that "the choice of the revolving doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides".
So , all in all , there 's no breakfast during working hours , no coffee or croissants .
Brunetta's advice is a smiling one: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock is a miracle".
During a meeting of the Superior Board of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione), the President of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Italy, Mr
The Minister of Labour and Social Affairs of the Republic of Italy, Mr. P. G. de la Malène, has just announced that "within three months, the number of official absences has been reduced to 50%, which means that 60,000 more people are present at work each year".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration.
"The Minister said that in the last eight to ten years, the dynamics of wages in the private sector have been twice as high and well above the rate of inflation".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined forces to oppose the Brunetta decree in the context of the Codacon-sponsored appeal.
"While the Minister for Public Service is making headlines with figures on reduced absenteeism", writes the Consumer Centre, "the population of 'active lazy people' is constantly growing.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable public servants have banded together to declare war on the unlawful standards of the decree".
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is being challenged for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick employee, during which inspection visits can be made, and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are also being challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
The data from the National Institute for the Control of Work Information (INAIL) show that the number of fatal accidents at work in 2007 was about 1200.
These figures illustrate the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will mark the 58th National Day for Victims of Work Accidents in all the Italian provinces, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this tragic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the crucial importance of prevention at work", President Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in his message to the President of the National Association of Disabled Workers (AMIL), Pietro Mercandelli.
The President expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to workplace prevention, to the protection of injured workers, to the assistance of the families of the victims and to the raising of public awareness".
"There has been a lot of outrage, which is understandable in the case of tragedies which, given their scale, cause some turmoil in the media and public opinion, but the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events which can even be repeated in their own dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely a resource problem: there is a crucial need to invest in education and information".
The many initiatives to increase the direct awareness of the world of work by young people in schools are of particular importance.
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not to distract from its social importance.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which offends the conscience of all of us and obliges all the institutions to work towards decisive rules aimed at putting an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is far too high", emphasises Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this 'positive tendency' to mean less attention, which is what causes the tragedy in the end".
"We believe that there is basically not enough action to deal with the phenomenon of accidents.
We believe that more controls and inspections are needed  Mercandelli; but also more measures to educate workers who are already starting school".
"Further efforts are needed", he adds, "in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, there is a need for greater responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon which constitutes a social emergency".
Mercandelli also spoke of "the progressive deterioration of protection for victims of accidents at work" and denounced the "abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
'The aim is therefore to return to the employee a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations, which are decided from time to time by a legislator.'
MP3 player charged: risk of hearing damage
Listening to loud music for a long time with portable music devices, such as MP3 players, can lead to permanent hearing loss.
This is reported by the European Commission, which quotes the opinion of the EU's Csrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) in a report released in Brussels today.
"The report  notes in a note  that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for more than one hour a day for at least five years are at risk of permanent hearing loss".
"I am concerned that so many young people who normally turn portable music devices and mobile phones to a high volume are unwittingly damaging their hearing irreparably", says Meglena Kuneva.
'The scientific findings , the EU says, show a clear risk which calls for rapid action.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
In the light of this scientific knowledge, we need to review the existing control systems to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with new technology".
The independent scientific committee was commissioned by Brussels in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
"The scientists confirm that there is a legitimate concern and that the European Commission will now, together with the other Member States and the parties concerned, examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise emitted by portable musical instruments and similar devices".
There is already a European standard limiting the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, because of the concern about the damage that could result from excessive noise exposure.
We can greatly limit this damage by taking steps such as reducing the volume and the duration of noise exposure.
In its report, the European Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable music devices listen to loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, then the legal limits on maximum noise levels at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who cross this music threshold risk losing their hearing completely within five years.
This represents 5-10% of the users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno gives the go-ahead for the Commission for the Future of the Capital
We start today, finish in March, get the balance in June.
The Commission has been meeting this morning in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months' time, President Marzano and the other 49 Members of the Commission will draw up guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the city and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and represents all political, social and cultural opinions", emphasises Alemanno. "It will propose a development plan for Rome, the political responsibility for which will remain with the city and the local council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the desire to have a place where one can develop a major project for Rome.
In March, their work will be finished and the Commission will be dissolved again, as such a project must have a definite end date.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
To those who question the Commission's competence because its opinion is not binding, Alemanno replies: 'Everything depends on the work the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If they produce quality results, as the Attali Commission did in France, and this will certainly be the case in Rome, their contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is concerned with the everyday problems and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to look at a longer period of time to be able to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city with a deeper perspective".
The Mayor of Rome is keen to make clear that 'this Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a cent and it will make us think.
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static, in order to allow our city to make a leap in quality - which it really needs - and thus take a common step into the future".
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, which "will not be confined to the current municipal boundaries but will look much further", not only in terms of Rome's role as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama  the first anti-American president?
A well-known American politician who is keen to be regarded as independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and who maintained relations with Islam (and still does so today as a private citizen)".
The attacks on Obama are getting more and more intense, especially as the election approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on a Web site: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama is very arrogant: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!
But actually these attacks don't have much to say; they're racist attacks, and they don't answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there's the polls; everyone says Obama will win by a huge margin.
Again, there are people who speak with their hearts and not their heads.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the deep south of the United States, wrote in its editorial that it is only in the voting booth that we will know who the true American patriot will vote for.
This is a reflection of the mentality of the United States, which has been kept hidden until the very last moment.
"Say what you want, and we'll decide who we're gonna make our bowls for, whether it's Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we'll emigrate from America.
Something that has never been heard before, only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
We asked 1,500 people what mistakes Bush made during his time in office, and 89% said the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Yet Iraq remains for the most part Bush's weakness.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse is also affecting journalists: the cuts are already being felt in the newspapers, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the print media.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control over the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not express any genuine concern about the general credibility of the information to the relevant authorities.
You don't feel as alone as you used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The crisis of 2008 is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
Added to this are the major problems of the cuts in the newsroom, the space in which the editors work to assemble the paper.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we are to prevent traditional journalism, as understood by the general public, from shrinking considerably.
A clear but complicated pessimism is now in the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and senior press executives believe that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local sector, executives are up to 65%.
Printed versus broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to imagine where the web is going.
Major publishing groups are making their way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they wanted to join the new technology, hoping "it would bring something good to journalism".
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national editors are confident that their reporters share their values with them, compared to only 23% at local level.
Some people think it has to do with "safety at work".
The number of managers who fear losing their jobs within three years is 47% at national level.
The journalists are 30%.
The topic of "safe working" in teams (our "editors", ed.) is always a hot topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers offer as they please and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editors-in-chief are often paid very high salaries, whereas the editor can sometimes receive only 10,000 euros a month, plus pensions and insurance money.
The problem with holidays is that they are complicated: a certain number of days in the first year, so on and so on after the third year, and finally, after a certain number of years, 15 days.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often "get sick" during the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: Judged in Rome: Danilo Coppola remains in the GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the real estate agent, who had requested to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-contract in the case of the takeover of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a mandatory residency in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked for permission to move the real estate agent from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the Court, such transfers (against which the Prosecutor's Office had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and to obtain evidence against him.
The elite are in danger
This phenomenon was already apparent a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the White House's $700 billion austerity package: a large portion of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the New York Times' report yesterday, which reports how the ongoing crisis is dividing the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives who are hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world, and is winning voters, especially in the South and the center of the states.
This section of the party owes its rise mainly to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example is only a small part of the great changes that the present economic earthquake is heralding or even already representing: not only in the United States, but throughout the West and perhaps beyond.
The crisis in both the States and in Europe seems to be accelerating the long-feared events which are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the extraordinary renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is in fact a decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close links with foreign countries and manage a vast amount of the wealth of private households living in a single country.
This is a direct political problem for governments: how to deal with the families concerned, who are also a huge constituency.
The crisis is thus economically global, while politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have become marginalised and to have lost its right to speak: the EU, divided into different national and international conflicts, is the clearest proof of this.
So now everyone is counting on the intervention of their own state, rescue plans, new rules, and most importantly, the distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the United States is in the economic position to save itself without outside help.
And besides the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: two conditions which cannot be overestimated  under certain circumstances , which no international organization or market would otherwise be able to use in a similar way.
The new emphasis on the national-state element is also in perfect harmony with the growing importance recently attached to a closely related sector in the economy: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is now, when we have long been convinced that we have entered a connected whole, a realm of ever-differentiating technologies, of the intangible, that we must suddenly realize how our future will increasingly depend on the essentially material things: water, crops and oil.
While all of these can be transported from one place to another in the world, they are nevertheless linked to a narrowly defined piece of land  a territory.
Thus, one who has such territory has an advantage over another who lives in an area that is barren, waterless, or free of oil.
I now come to the second novelty, which requires a brief introduction.
If you say territory, if you say government, if you say politics, you say leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to be producing two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respectable leadership, so the need for someone who knows how to run things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation at the existing leadership, especially the economic one, which has proved to be inadequate and full of shadows.
Finally, there is a deeper and in a sense even more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an intolerance, a sense of futility, a sense of distance, all of which are directed at a whole class of managers in Western countries.
It seems that the conviction is thus opening up among large sections of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite but their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is increasingly alien and obsolete to the majority.
The demand for leadership is thus underground fuelling a branched but powerful movement of disempowerment of the ruling class and the traditional political establishment, manifested in unforeseen "riots" by voters and in the indirect shift in the collective mood of recent times: from the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, to the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of the American MPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy plays a role here too).
It seems that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their magazines, their intellectual creditors, some would say their format, have more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value in relation to what is happening today in the lower social strata of the West, and is being further amplified by the financial crisis and pushed to the over-dimensionality.
In view of all this, it would be an exaggeration to speak of a "revolt of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The Super Glue That Can Blow Up Walls
To overcome the forces of gravity with a glue and to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which now seems to be almost at the finish line.
Using a glue applied to an area of only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers were able to fix a 100-kilogram body on a vertical wall.
STUDIO  is an American journal that has published the results of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material the research team has developed is an improvement on the adhesive materials already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be thought of as a series of tubes arranged on a stack of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the geckos' feet, which are covered with microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect grip.
Tests with various materials, such as glass teflon and sandpaper, showed that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the reptile's feet and "can be easily removed from the wall", says Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be used as a perishable glue", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but researchers are thinking about a less fascinating use, like connecting electrical devices, because nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be in the field of space.
So for now, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH  The University of California, Berkeley, is also working on a new type of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, scientists in California present a glue made of microfibers that, like a hair, cleans itself of dust by moving on a surface, thus maintaining a perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed especially in summer because of their refreshing quality and their richness in vitamins, can cause serious health damage when taken together with certain vital medicines, since they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, has repeatedly pointed out the risks of packaged and fresh fruit juices in connection with medication. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again sounded the alarm: One glass of apple, orange, or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines to the point where they are virtually eliminated, thus endangering the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice has already been suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines, such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiovascular medicines, anxiolytics and neurological agents, to toxic levels.
MEDICINS IN CONTACT  In a report two years ago, the same drug agency warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mixture, stressing that they should be careful about what they drink when taking drugs such as diazepan or methadone.
It's NOT JUST GRAPEFRUIT  According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
This is why Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano, appeals: 'Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still uncertainties, do not hesitate to ask a pharmacist or doctor", emphasizes the expert of the ANSA agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics is going to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics goes to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular columns for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most vocal critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policies.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in an editorial in the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction which received a lot of controversy and was presented to economists years later, but which has now proved to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals surrounding the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank's Executive Committee, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a banalizer with a "very aggressive style, particularly directed against the Bush administration's excessive liberalism".
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package is released
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software is gaining more and more users, both at home and in the office, among freelancers and in public administration, as a free substitute for Microsoft Office.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, overseen by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the public with some novelties: in addition to a revised and now more Spartan design of the Start menu, it has finally achieved a guaranteed compatibility from the ground up with Apple's Mac OS x operating system, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
The Commission also opposed compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, which allows OpenOffice to read new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are also some new features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send via email, for example. This includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphics editing modules while preserving the original appearance of the page.
This also allows the creation of "hybrid" PDF files, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format to include the elements of a spreadsheet and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited by several users, thus avoiding conflicts when changes are made; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a query to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently releasing various OpenOffice features on the cloud, with the final results to be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. It follows the English version, which has been available on Mirrors since Friday.
Apart from Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can be sent to your home or office upon request.
While the free offer can be an incentive for the spread of the software in private households, it is also in the business sector where OpenOffice could be the big winner: after all, several public administration institutions and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, it does not even lack a training programme, which means optimal support for small and medium-sized enterprises and thus even business opportunities.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word-compatible word processing program; Calc, the spreadsheet program aimed at displacing Excel; Impress, for creating PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase for running databases instead of the more familiar Access; and, lastly, Draw, a graphics module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads  a target which can easily be exceeded with 3 million 600 thousand downloads already achieved.
Kohl also tested positive, making it the fourth doping case
A new doping case has been opened in the context of the last Tour de France: it concerns the Austrian Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who finished third and won the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver to test positive for Cera, the third-generation Epo, after Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli from Italy and Stefan Schumacher from Germany.
The analyses from Kohl's blood samples are among those taken by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories in recent weeks.
If the tests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be banned from racing for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive epotest and also notified the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed to the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THE New York Times asks: Is Italy racist, or is it a country that is not racist?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants, has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", who are only welcomed with reluctance.
This is the question posed by the New York Times in a long article devoted entirely to the subject of racism in Italy, based on the case of a young man, of Burkina Faso descent, Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after stealing a package of cookies.
The case illustrates what the Times calls the "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are the ones with "the most integration and job opportunities" and yet "the highest levels of anti-immigration sentiment and the greatest support for the Lega Nord".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times cites further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and to speed up the deportation of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A move that the pope and the president also emphasize: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between church and state to combat racism".
Student victims of high rents of up to €900 per room
The market for student housing is not in crisis.
According to the latest study by Sunia, the tenants' union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious characteristics: whole groups of students are effectively losing their right to study because their families are not able to support them at this level", says Laura Mariani, Sunia's head of education. "The high demand from students in these cities has led to a distortion of the market which has also hurt the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers involve a number of infringements: free contracts, no registration, no limit on the rental price, illegal sub-leases.
For Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures which would lead to lower rental prices through a revision of taxation.
A closer look at the study shows that in Milan a bed in the Brianza district costs around 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera districts or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350-400 euros, a room 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the university districts, 250/280 euros for a sleeping place of necessity, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices in the university districts are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double room.
The rent is only slightly lower in the districts around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who avoid the outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a place to sleep and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar neighbourhoods.
In Naples, you need 300-450 euros for a place to sleep, and the price of a room is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a bed costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In smaller towns, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: foreign students are charging rent rates 25-30% above the average.
Goodbye to the old cinema paradise  cities are closing their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas are closing because of the multiplex cinema.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes".
This picture by Giuseppe Tornatore is a powerful description of what is happening in the major urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of large multi-screen complexes in the periphery, means in the long run the death of the one-screen cinema in the centre, a process which not only seems inevitable and irrevocable but also has the characteristics of a cultural crime.
The film, which won him the Oscar and the Grand Prix de Cannes 20 years ago, tells the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia of living in a world of cinema that is lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, are clear: in the last five years, the vast number of 316 traditional cinemas has been forced to close, the majority of which have been in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely in these three regions that the greatest number of these modern cinemas have been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the list, 81 are in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way", says Paolo Protti, president of Anec. "Although it is useful to have new structures, the main priority is to preserve the existing one, because when a venue closes in the city, not all its regular customers are willing to go to a multi-screen cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
The remaining budget for the trade union fund is extremely low: the state's debt burden is about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from an ethical and moral standpoint that the government does not respect the existing laws.
The sector would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year to survive".
The case of Bologna is interesting, the first Italian city to decide, out of concern for the old cinemas, to protect them by means of an agreement between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historic centre and in the periphery.
The measures envisaged include tax advantages for the cinema operators and public transport benefits: driving to the restricted areas of the centre and parking at cheaper rates.
"It is a welcome initiative", says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow our example and also come up with new concepts.
But of course we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to counter the superpower of the multiplex, because after all, today's audiences are more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been toying with the idea for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to one side so as not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
Political links with the 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The charges brought by the prosecutor's office of the anti-mafia authority of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, was also handcuffed, as was his nephew: the lawyer, who shares the clan's boss' name, had already been convicted of involvement in mafia criminal associations, at the time for a sum of 10 million euros.
"In defiance of all moral and legal norms", the lawyers write, "the two local administrations decided to pay Piromalli money for his consulting activities".
"This made it possible for the mafia group, the judges, to enter the town halls by official means and to influence the policies of the public administration".
The president of the Calabria Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter links between local authorities and organized crime.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who keep their white vests".
The arrests this morning follow those last July, which police say beheaded the Piromalli clan.
Since the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but as early as 1991 local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices, also because of alleged links between organized crime and the local administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition following the May 2006 by-election.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He accused the Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti of making up the story for political and strategic reasons, but the judges say that in connection with the arrest warrant issued this morning, the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
A search operation in connection with the investigation of the Dal Torrione case showed a willingness to accommodate the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli  thus making the actions of the public administration identical with the interests of this clan".
When the energy comes out of the waves, suddenly the big ones are running up
It is a never-ending source of money, covering over 70% of the planet's surface, and only now do the world's major energy companies seem to be realizing this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and also looking to occupy, giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years; it is no coincidence that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil fell in the 1980s, the idea of marine energy was lost on the minds of many, but now environmental organizations and the rising price of oil are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of global energy demand could be met by the energy generated by ocean waves.
This would be twice as much energy as is currently produced by nuclear power plants.
Added to this would be the tides and currents.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 to build a power plant in the north of Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy sector are now turning to marine energy production.
"Chevron is looking into these technologies", said a spokesman for a company familiar with the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, "and is considering whether to work with us".
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a regulation on the use of the term 'common market' in the United States.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially when one considers that in Alaska, the United States continues to drill for oil and that President Bush has only recently started plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; although details are not known, observers are reporting an increasing interest.
Technology that needs improvement.
Experts say that the technology is still in its infancy, not least because the last doubts of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects like the one in Portugal and also in Scotland are of a rather small scale and do not seem to be causing any serious environmental problems.
However, large-scale energy production requires technologies with a much greater impact on the environment.
There are several ways: Ocean Power uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves that move the buoys up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure inside the swimmer by means of pistons and cylinders.
This one powers a turbine, which in turn powers a generator.
The power is sent to the coast via underwater pipelines.
The Commission has already proposed four such plants, which are still awaiting approval by the government, and some of the energy produced could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power is already producing power for a department store and a parking lot using undersea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water moves during the tides, which drives the turbines, which feed the generator through the rotation.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential customers are already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
The Institute for Power Generation Research is currently interested in the potential of the tides.
Although irregular, tides are more predictable than wind currents, sunlight, and even waves, making them a more reliable source of electricity.
It is tidal energy that has led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest $7.5 million in 2008 - and up to $35 million is planned for 2009.
