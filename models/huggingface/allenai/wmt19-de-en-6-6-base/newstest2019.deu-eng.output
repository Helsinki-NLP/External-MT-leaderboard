DFB ’ s head Grindel sees no basis for comeback
Berlin DFB's president Reinhard Grindel does not currently see a basis for a return of the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that one comes into conversation with him, that one also talks to him about why he apparently felt that one or the other as it is laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmower" of the "Picture" newspaper.
In spite of the months of debate over the photos taken with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92 national player.
"I would have liked to have continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case, "said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB ’ s team in July and also justified him by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB head of the league repeated his criticism that he was not ready for a conversation with the league leader Joachim and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build pressure, but he knows it from the football so that when "one leaves a team or changes a club, that one talks about it with his coach and I find it a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Garden Hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 14: 13 the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was in default.
The fire brigade went out and found the hut in full fire.
The roof had to be removed practically completely and fire debris had to be cleared to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery for charging for lunch.
This may be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to fire brigade, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined, as well as the cause of the fire.
It should be considerable, however, because the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to take the children away from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") himself streamed live, as she apparently wants to take away the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US Federal Portal for the first time and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see "Fortunately kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family almost escapes from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
It accuses adults of trafficking in children.
For all this, it does not provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan can be heard in the video as she follows the family further along the street.
Apparently she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks as if she turns around and gives Lohan a slap in the face.
With tears the actress asserts how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What moved Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe started in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The Lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: number of deaths on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
At least 420 deaths are reported after the severe earthquake of 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Chairman of the Supervisory Board
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla ’ s CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets at the beginning of August, when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletrocar builder.
The US Stock Exchange Supervisory Authority sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he may remain CEO.
British Conservative Party
Sharp Guaranteed - the Conservative Party Congress
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The Congress will focus on foreign policy, trade issues, and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit ’ s hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a New State Name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these duplications of names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called Northern Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("Der nicht") - means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before Brazil ’ s presidential election, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The “Trump of Brazil ” is the anti-penalty system of the candidate and is thus at the forefront of the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers ’ Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force still exists," said Development Director Peter Mertens to the industry magazine "Automobile Week".
The arrested and permitted Audi leader Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / transmission combinations are expected to be tested", he said.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we have reached an important stage in the recovery of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was established in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi ’ s mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "serious organisational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler ’ s future on Friday and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities accuse the Audi CEO of having approved the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the exhaust fraud has been announced.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Sales Director Bram Schot heads the company as Acting Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the changeover to the new exhaust and consumer test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronn Voice".
Basically, he sees a decreasing demand for limousines such as the A6, A7 and A8 Audi models produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
15,000 reservations have already been made for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel strives for re-election - to be elected to the DFB Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - In spite of the criticism of his person after the World Cup, Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for the office as DFB's president next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as possible," said Grindel as a guest at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" on early Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again for a re-election, I will do so.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not want to "cooperate in the future project" after the contract for the football championship 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the head of the association as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who had fallen over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first complete three-year term.
The next vote will take place at the German Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future European Championship cheforganiser, Philipp, is expected to participate in the DFB Presidium.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he will continue to advise the Bureau in this role and then, of course, be cordially invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether he could become his successor as DFB ’ s head.
As a consequence of the affair with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ilkay Gündogan about the photos, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a candidate without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently this office of Brazilian born Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says," the subject is important, we have to take care of it ", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration must work", said Grindel.
Remove correctly with half-wise scales
I have a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that measures not only my weight but also the body fat content.
It can also display muscle and bone mass.
The thing also calculates the body measure index, but it is more for the dice.
He says nothing about whether I have replaced fat with muscles.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena the runner-up easily won 112: 55 (52: 31) and offered over 40 minutes a convincing match.
With 20 points, Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer in Berlin.
Johannes Thiemann (18 meters), who was hired from Ludwigsburg, also showed an attractive performance in front of 9113 spectators in his compulsory debut match.
Ex-champion Brose Bamberg won the compulsory debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84: 80 (39: 37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.

A 26: 1 round of Baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen offensive movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow the PKK or Gülen movement's sympathizers to shake our citizens and harm the German Turkish friendship, "he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque the Cologne city center had been partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were in service - among them also snipers.
The Ditib Islamic Association is under criticism because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Terrible Second
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York ’ s Central Park.
"Get involved wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of about 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I ’ m nervous, I sweat, but it ’ s okay because I ’ m here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations, also appeared on stage during the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a second of terror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shots, were afraid and tried to escape.
In short panic arose, people ran confused.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin calmed down people from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You are all in safety.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the internet.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was cheering and applause from the audience - Buhrufe on the other hand for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, along with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke out on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had pronounced himself in the US Senate ’ s Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, thereby pushing many women in front of their heads.
At least three women have raised charges of abuse, including attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations, after two women who, according to their own claims, themselves experienced sexual assault, confronted him in an elevator on his way to the committee meeting.
"You can also meet me in an elevator at any time," Flake said to the audience at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends the ejection of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had covered a shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, was not the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disturbance of the press conference.
The action of the journalist caused a strong unrest, which is unacceptable.
He therefore caused the protector to bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely irrespective of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Numerous journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in forbidden parties or the Fethullah -Gülen -movement.
The Turkish leadership is making the movement responsible for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not sure about the Turkish authorities: only at the beginning of September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Most recently, the cases of imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a sensation.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but trials are still ongoing in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz totally drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by NDR is known for its humid conversations at the counter of the Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Presenter Ina Müller calls with her guests on some beer, some wine or even high-percentage drinks, in order to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing inserts.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from movies like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der geilste Tag".
But the trip to the high north was not good for Munich.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumbled on it, the eyes only two small slits.
Selfie's bed shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only one mighty male.
addressed to his fans he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights he has now gained: "Rule one: goes NEVER to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drinks the black sow.
And Spritz.
And the round Egg Liqueur, which is throwing Ina by half three, also lets go.
Alcohol consumption is truly in the face of the 43 year old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to fight the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others simply amused themselves over the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
As Ina Müller has survived the nightlife, it has not yet been known.
But since she has been moderating the TV show at the bar since 2007, the 53 year-old seems to be much more proven...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and treason
The entry into the 36 kilometre long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is hard to find and wastes.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Shards, cigarette tipping, garbage and waste, demolished trash bins and meanwhile dismantled signs - this is how the entry into the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa is presented for a long time.
For the flagship object railway bike path in the Red Rippchenland a more than unworthwhile sight.
The topic employs members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the cycling officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the Radverkehrsbeirat.
There has not been a solution so far.
The proposals ranged from laying the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible other activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also introduced the topic to the local advisory board.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is on weekends regular meeting point for celebrations.
It is not only often loud, but it also destroys the railing: posts are torn out of the ground, trash bins are demolished, signs are bent over, seat furniture is lubricated.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting point for Saufgelage.
"Along the entire cycle path, there is clearly the focus here on the Haaße hill," confirms the cyclist, who is now also taking care of the new cycling facility in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive".
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this sets the threshold much higher to attack common goods.
This would, however, require that a police patrol pass by promptly.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes for a development of the Haaße hill.
It must be made more attractive.
You can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The tourist marketing is still extendable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany ", says the ADFC's members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation in the Ascheröder Strasse in Treysa as an extremely critical danger point.
There is no detour on the Haaße hill.
In the case of heavy traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of traffic, "she explains.
This is no problem for sporty drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest at Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the city offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with wink in the likeable Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family relationship with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations began, from the One Man Band to the great ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long Albachtener living in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the Kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not yet experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the authors see themselves connected with?
The Hiltruper See and Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the villages.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his striking song.
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Time and again it was about experiencing coexistence in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about her work.
Thus one learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
The sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann knew Franke to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all sorts of things on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was still something special for the favourites of the jury - so that others can listen to their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup Hit, who impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children played again for the final - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of melody and recognition value.
The jury consisted of Gisbert Keller of the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the Stadteiloffensive.
The city offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event to be a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word "Decrypto" in the game test
Players form two teams sitting opposite each other.
For each page there is a sightseeing circle, in it four cards with keywords, which you - the old trick with the red slide - can decipher only when you put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read by mistake.
On the maps, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Cube.
4. Feast ".
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
For here the concepts are not to be guessed, but codes.
Alternating one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card on which maybe "3.4.2" stands.
In "Decrypto" you should guess not the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice", "hard" and "windows" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible does not; because that wins the game if he succeeds twice to crack the code.
The encryptor writes down and reads loudly: "Throw" for the cubes, "lots" as a contrast to festival; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he has taken care of the school and knows the shutdown there.
So it goes round by round, team by team.
One does not know the concepts of the opposite side - but it can get together better with any hint given there by the encrypter.
As mysterious as possible, but not too turned the rewriting should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic of "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But if you have started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling you feel in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genres' Primus "Codenames", which likewise covers a agent theme to a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And who is only interested in installing and not in winning points, can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate twice during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler greeting in the Upper City of a passing police strip, later he also appeared in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he clearly alcoholized the given place reference by the police did not follow, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the detention cell.
In a sober state, he must then also be criminally responsible for using characteristics of unconstitutional organisations.
Betriebswerk Pressig was home of the Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991 a piece of railroad ended with history.
"When buffers banged at buffers, one heard it in whole Pressig", remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That did not inspire anyone.
The brakes squeaked and the wagons cried.
That was pure railways.
Statements that represent Dinkel ’ s homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railways.
Here was the starting point for the steep ramps to the north, which after an ascent by about 220 altitude meters has its vertex in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, train and drawer locomotives were needed earlier, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901 the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive shed, apprenticeship workshop, overhead line and railway master.
"The heart was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and for 47 years professional iron worker.
Locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben were also operated by the railway plant (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 people; 13 steam and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimized the need for train and drawer locomotives.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 wagons were still ranged per month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were broken down, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not envisaged better use of the site, including in relation to freight transport".
Still on Pentecost 1989 the railway management Nuremberg celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary "50 years electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," Georg Dinkel remembers.
A little later the end.
On 1 June 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn, the shunting station Pressig was history.
"The shunting and inhibitor did the most difficult work in train traffic," reminds Dinkel.
Any misuse would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig has led Rothenkirchen for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with success at the opening at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Champion of the league Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis championship in Beijing as Julia Görges did before.
Kerber won the China Open 6: 2, 6: 2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the Third Party is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6: 3, 4: 2 against Dariah Kassatkina, when the Russian woman who was placed at number 13 gave up.
The Schwäbin is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened during the weekend as part of the series "Art and Pleasure".
Organizers and visitors registered with great relief the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Wind Game Performance" was opened in the open area of the estate Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Around Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Pleasure".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was shown by a large number of visitors.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprising, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already actively participated in the selection of artists in the past and contributed flyers.
Again this year, on the occasion of art & pleasure, there is a 70 cents special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased about the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framework.
During the walk through the spacious garden, it quickly becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Wind Game Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art of metal or ceramics, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property awaits the visitor on the right side of the "lucky tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree trunk, brightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushes in the background, the object looks magically sunny and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K & G.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
Halfway, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "Der Wind das himmlische Kind".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colourful imagination and structures made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of "Wind Game - Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singer celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - this was the time of protest and the student movement.
And also the Albachten made air at that time their resentment.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more sangesleben in the district.
It has become a legend in the meantime: At a bank in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It's going to be full today", Chairman Jürgen Holstiege suspected, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
They had revived the foundation festival, especially for the anniversary.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary the traditional festival was back.

Volleyball: 3. Liga Frauen: USC II gewinnt hochklassiges Derby gegen BW Aasee
The ascender marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under patronage of Axel Büring finds itself really well in league three.
No trace of shyness or fracture, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against city competitor BW Aasee really well.
"That was not crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA Coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied ". On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the atmosphere was good, the game checked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring that to the goal, such a game can already tilt", knows Büring from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its experienced forces and brought the full yield to the finish.
"We all know who is standing in such a Derby on the other side.
This does not break our neck.
I have seen good volleyball in phases, "Annacker did not quarrel with the 0: 3 - and immediately went over to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independent, seems not to be foreseeable after just three days of playing.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with Bundesliga volleyball. "In the fourth league they no longer want to focus their gaze down anyway.
Should the vest not be soiled in the next weeks, they must look up.
A first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee starts in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Dream Ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she openly talks about the fact that the series might have had a share in her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of the chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went on board forever.
The series she made a star could be jointly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world with a suitcase alone and many of my admired colleagues saw me at eye level, "says Keller in a conversation with the" Bild am Sonntag ".
At first she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so well".
She thinks it is possible that her husband at that time might have been envious, but "like many men Hans was afraid of talking about problems and feelings".
Keller always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have adjusted myself ", as she explains further.
She always had the feeling of "not being good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, which I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever. "
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time".
The day before the civil wedding, I sat in the wardrobe howling and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at that time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love far too naively ".
The night butcher, who regularly explores the city ’ s nightlife in the NZZ department of Zurich, has ventured into the ZFF ’ s opening party this time.
Our fold is not a moth, but a little shyness.
And the bright splendour in which a green carpet is dipped on the Sechseläutenplatz blinds him over fee.
But it is just a film festival where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening he peaks over the place, in order to facilitate himself in the "Aquaclean -WC - Oasis" briefly.
This is how the public toilet system, which is sponsored by a large sanitary company, celebrates its premiere at the festival, is called: the Needs Institute on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks to heaven in the gentlemen's oasis for some reason.
So out here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who in the cinema next door the opening film "Green Book" just entertained at the best level, celebrate like every year the festival start with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: the shown works are known to come from the whole world.
What do you not have to think about in an article about this festival, in order not to fall into a bleak advertisement for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly binds a little tie around the feelers, which a good fairy has attached to it, and two bulky doormen wave it in generously.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance far after midnight to live music or can be pretended by DJ rhythms to which they scream at each other, and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite appetizers.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters await slurping mouths, next door, the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: All the shelves of exclusive products have not been cleaned up for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for that!
The folder studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If this is two separate instructions, he has lost himself in the dresscode.
But it is rather a conditional construction, and it certainly has saved lives.
In the household department on the upper floor, the winged one tilts a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival's award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not receive the prize for the best drink necessarily.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting this brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But there, between local prominence, cash desk and kitchen items, a face passes, which is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor is not likely to be far away.
And really: immediately Viggo Mortensen walks, with almost sixty almost acting like a choir boy, through the crowd.
It is not squatted, it is not given, at most it is barred.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as empathy, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia's dancing
Trainer and former soccer star Diego Maradona is pleased about the victory of his team.
Argentina ’ s football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia and Rythmen, as shown in a video already released on Saturday.
Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, fired by the players, in the 15 hour notice clip of a team member.

After the game Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my guys, always".
The 57 year-old has been training the Mexican Club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send after last minute bankruptcy "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, Coach of the Handball League League League League ASV Send, could hardly grasp it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29: 30 (12: 14) - bust - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - not played badly over long phases, the Sendener.
Only the initial phase "we totally slept", the ASV trainer was annoyed.
The teams quickly led with 8: 1, even the early break, which Bieletzki had taken, did not fertilize at first.
"But then suddenly a jerk went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
For the break, the gap was only two goals.
Especially Senden ’ s best, Marius Hintze, met another time in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor ’ s point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst resembled 15: 15, then the relay changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
The impartial intervene.
Bieletzki usually beware of seeking guilt with others.
But: The 120 seconds penalty, the Steffen Mühlhoff penalty, "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit four times until the end - while the decimated ASV failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well behind also against seven man and thrown again and again to the empty goal.
Only they can buy little for compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come", said the completely served Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (County Court), the police are looking for the mortal remains of the woman.
On Saturday, forces dug up a road at Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers were removed, as police and public prosecutor ’ s office jointly reported.
New evidence suggests that the missing may not have been buried far from their place of residence.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
Investigators did not exclude a crime at that time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the Prosecutor ’ s Office, continues to work intensively on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered a conspicuousness under the road near Marxgrün by means of a ground wheel.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials bordered the site on a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hackers ’ attack on millions of Facebook users shows which dangers lurk on the net.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated character sequences, users should prefer to use passphrases to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, such as Windows, should be installed quickly, and it does not harm to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Supervisory Authority (SEC) filed an out-of-court dispute over misleading Twitter ’ s news in which Musk could have lost permission to lead listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk leaves the Chairman ’ s post for three years, a position comparable to that of Germany ’ s Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
He may remain head of office.
In the comparison, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not aware of guilt
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed about the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters that he would perhaps take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, while the financing was secured.
This would have given Tesla a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla remained on the stock exchange.
Following the agreement, Tesla will now have to find an external chairman, hire two independent board members, and set up a committee to monitor Musks communication.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel as Chancellor by 2021
After the shrivels of the past weeks, the GroKo collected several surveys.
The SPD falls behind the offensive in a questioning - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The Social Democratic Party (SPD) has overtaken the picture for the first time nationwide on Sunday.
In the weekly survey conducted by the opinion research institute, the Social Democratic Party moves by a counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives off a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
Also CDU and CSU lose a counter and come only to 27 per cent.
This is the deepest value for the Union on Sunday.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the leftists 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were to take place on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would, according to Emnid, get only 43 percent of the votes.
This means that the grand coalition has lost the majority of all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach - on Sunday.
The government parties consistently reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they still received 53.4 percent.
The bandwidth of the other parties is also great: the Netanyahu, in several polls the second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens achieve votes of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is at an average of 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the percentage of votes.
But support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
At the moment, only 48 percent of the citizens still find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid poll on behalf of BamS showed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 per cent) currently wants the grand coalition to hold in three years until the next regular Bundestag election. 41 per cent are in favour of a new election.
A further poll published on Saturday also showed significant losses of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should once again run for the CDU chairmanship in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, while 44 percent are against.
As a result, 64 per cent of the Union ’ s supporters wish for candidacy, 35 per cent do not.
Note at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Those who say that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic connoisseurs - should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dates" by Tinder and Co. the supermarket as connoisseurs radiates a place for great love almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxershort bargains at the cooling table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder stands in the reputation of being a slippery stock exchange rather than a contact.
We dared the test: How do women react, just in the first message not long around the hot porridge?
Here is the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood ’ s lovestory has potential then if love luck precedes a Out of Home ’ s Eyes Lost and Found Plot.
If the guy then also at the E-Mail address bio putenfleisch @ gmx.de with its angebeteten reports, then this sounds already very much after Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Konsorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So the author of this advertisement in an unknown Aldi branch is quite to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 per cent reduced organic turkey meat".
She has definitely earned her Happy End à la Hollywood for believing in the magic of getting to know analogue.

Football: Soccer: Researchers Appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine Makes Courage
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
Wortkarg gave himself, the coach of the football league division VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (inwardly) to think about the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it is running again around Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1: 1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only narrowly cracked past the ascent.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen, "said Fetsch, praising his boys and looking for each and every one of them to say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4 -4 -2 almost seamlessly over into a 4 -2 -3 -1, in which Niklas Thewes in front of the front waited for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more parts in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), the change of Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost that would have happened when the SCA hit dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box in minute 41 twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed scarcely.
Schroer came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes input.
With the change of Miles Geske Fetsch missed the left side again a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell down Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect penalty for the Platzherren 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The Gefoulte himself entered and demonstrated his danger to standards.
Westhue's "thing with the right slapping hit down left from the shooter's point of view - 1: 0 (71.).
20 minutes still, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute the leather in the unlucky hand.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) showed immediately to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to survive in the final minutes, before Geske still had the winning goal in the 87th minute out of twelve meters.
Perhaps too much of the good would have been.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Helicopters in Kottingbrunn
During the landing there was still an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 14 o'clock it came to a drama on Sunday at the airfield in Kottingbrunn.
When a helicopter landed, turbulence occurred, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was captured by a gust of wind, crawled to the ground and came to a halt on the side.
Immediately police, rescue and fire brigade were notified.
With a large crowd, the forces came to the accident site.
The ÖAMTC emergency medical helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one damage.

The exact circumstances surrounding the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject of the investigation.
According to fire brigade spokesman Franz Resperger, a small fire occurred, which could be extinguished quickly.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female at the deadline of September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
"Companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass by them," said Managing Director of the Foundation Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male executives - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
Compared to other German competitors, the gap is less diverse, innovative and future-oriented.
It is another corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies was also due solely to positive impulses in the medium-sized index companies (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in recent years pioneers - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked in the boards.
"I'm sure that next year Dax's companies will be recruiting more consistent women - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges from the supervisory boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 men less than a year ago.
"Recruiting as many women per year for the board of directors would already be 40% in 2023," the report says.

This question was addressed by "Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros of operating profit in the first half of the year with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put on each car vigorously.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good in the race with prices of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torch train to the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Weinfest
With a torchlight train, the Tourist Board opened its wine festival in Abtswind.

You can be proud of this, "said Starz to all the helpers.
Wine princess Lisa II later symbolically kicked off the stage with the guests.
"Nice, that again so many have found the way to us after Abtswind." Later, "Die Troglauer" provided for mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had fixed the drinks prices as 60 years ago for the anniversary in the afternoon.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival will take place on Friday, October 5, in the guest ’ s house before the second round of the festival tent one day later.
In Bonn: emergency car crashes in taxi
An emergency medical vehicle is badly damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passenger was fatally injured in the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best save lives.
Such a rescue trip put a deadly end to a 26 year-old in Bonn.
Bonn - A 26 year old pedestrian was fatally injured in the collision of an emergency medical car with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi drivers, the emergency doctor and their drivers were seriously injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency medical car had crossed a red traffic light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then met at a crossroads with the taxi that drove by green.
After the collision, the doctor's car hurled against a traffic light mast and a tree.
He captured the passer-by who died at the place of the accident.
driver of the emergency medical car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62 year old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency medical car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from operational forces.
The also seriously injured 29 years old emergency doctor could free herself, but the pedestrian could not help her anymore.
Another emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
In close consultation with the Bonn Public Prosecutor ’ s Office, the police determine who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, we feel uncomfortable
After the blamable exit in the league, Manchester United is losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
ManU 1: 3 is subject to West Ham United. The way of defeat should still be mentioned.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, in which the re-read Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot the 3: 1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into play.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel ’ s pass, all Manchester ’ s defensive players stopped and let Arnautovic pass the ball at the helpless David de Gea all over the world.
This was the negative climax of a performance already insufficient over long distances.
The mood at Uniteds Stadtrivale Manchester City is quite different.
Citizens, trained by Mourinho ’ s big competitor and citizen, came to a 2: 0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the exterior ’ s defensive bar for the home team for the first time.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former scorers, ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1: 2 defeat in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri and Liverpool fought a 1: 1 against Chelsea in the Premier League.
The Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the London Cup.
The hit of the 27 year old in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final.
Shaqiri, who came into the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After having started with a flawless record in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Trudeau in the Cup, and now the Blues Liverpool dropped out of the top of the championship.
Like City, London ’ s two city clubs, Tottenham (in Trudeau) and Arsenal (against ∑), celebrated 2-0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, in which Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait for a success report against the surprise team from the County of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Craig Cathcart, a defenseman, unfortunately bucked Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later, with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal has moved on with the fifth consecutive victory and is now in 5th position directly behind the big rival Tottenham. Wolverhampton continues to make a strong impression under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained undefeated for the fifth time in a row at the 2-0 against Southampton in the league and took 8th place.
VW ’ s core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show in the light of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no subject and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not let go of the German car dealers even at the industry meeting in Paris.
From next week, they will be exhibiting their novelties at the 2018 Motor Show in the French capital together with their competitors from all over the world.
The diesel does not really matter any more.
The possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin by then, should nevertheless be an important topic at least behind the brilliant scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes are there and have among other things their first pure electric models: The e-tron of Ingolstadt is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
But both were officially presented already.
The iNext from BMW is due to start in 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 series.
More than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car manufacturers, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which is celebrating its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
At least 380 people died in the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
Two earthquakes hit the island on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5,9, the second the strength 7,4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, and enormous damage has been caused.
After the quakes the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the coastal town of Palu for a party.
It is feared that the number of victims is still high.
So far, the figures have only come from Palu.
But there are also numerous other municipalities affected - along the west coast of Sulavesis.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship service in Werdohl
On Sunday, Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for motorcyclists in the peace church in Eveking with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The place in front of the peace church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the closing service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is therefore responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS and strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) is always held at Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers gathered there on Sunday to attend anything but ordinary service.
Already from 10 o'clock the Boliden were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
First the biker was on the program and it could be strengthened with coffee and cake or already with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was delivered during the biker's divine service to the parish priest Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical background.
"Although the bikers prefer blues and rock, Valerie Lill strikes rather poetic and calm tones," says Rev. Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big celebration: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann's Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated the process from ripe apple to apple juice to his amazed spectators step by step.
Then and when Hartmann Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the large funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could still imagine how a tasty drink would become.
But they were also able to look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped by nets, Georg Hartmann ’ s Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, looking a little like crochet, layer by layer on top of each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the Füchtorfer farmer also had already completed bottled specialties.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest spring white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere the parents came into conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built bouncy castle for themselves.
Also active members of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers engaged in the festival and invited at some stations to entertaining games.
Also next year the Heimatverein will offer an action day.
But then, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: after all, it will be around the milk.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season bankruptcy: "Schissene Situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in succession, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
A lot of positive things were not to be seen before at the 1: 4 (0: 2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out as a team," said 96 soccer pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "That's disappointing, of course, because you always do a lot".
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met for the connection, stand with two points at the very bottom and are in their current constitution a candidate for election.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated its first season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators, who pushed ahead of Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle of the table after the successful final rehearsal for the Europa League.
Croatia ’ s Vice President and World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse and never got under control from Hanover ’ s Defense.
The stricken forward after the World Cup showed with his speed and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, Brazilian Allan, who was borrowed from Liverpool FC, was also the first time in the initial formation of Frankfurt, which began vivaciously.
Lucas Torró ’ s (17th) counterfeit goal net posed a first threat.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defensive forces against Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back), who failed at short notice.
The leadership for the penalty box fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic picked up the ball after a defended corner in the penalty box, Haller extended his head to the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first reffer of the league for the defensive player coming from the French second division AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt continued before the break.
This time Haller fit his assault partner Rebic, who skilfully danced and 96 goalie Michael Esser left no chance.
In the half-time, Hanover's coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played now somewhat more courageously forward, but igniting ideas remained out until shortly before the end, when nevertheless still the connecting league succeeded.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After a short hour Rebic started a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was for the Frankfurt against exaggerated guests only show run, also Jovic met one minute before the end still.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
The Mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter managed to open the 185 in front of millions.
Munich Wies'n last week with two hits.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christen celebrate Holy Cross
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross on 14 September or on Sunday thereafter.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross with the closing blessing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30 year old war and on whom according to legend a Swedish soldier is said to have shot.
Blood then flowed out of the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished until today, only the altar room stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Fr. Adolf Buhl recalls that the Cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
The divine service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geisinger parish.
After the divine service the procession to the Holy Cross took place and with the closing blessing the church part of the Feast of the Cross ended.
For many years the Catholic church choir then invites to the secular part of the feast to the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm hofeis.
In the afternoon the parish still offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid and Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the façade, roof, the sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will last until next year.
After the scaffolding has already stood for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that already existed a few years ago has become greater, but more has also been detected, which was only made possible by the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The plaster work has been completed, the natural stone works are to be started before winter and a good half of these works are to be completed this year.
Inauguration: New Residence in the New Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau is opening a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" is handed over to its purpose - there were all present at the opening date agreed.
After all, the so far twelve wheelchair users, who already live in the dormitory of the Lebenshilfe Donau and Iller for some time, depend on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free entrances for all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former US Army officer building was put to the test for the inhabitants with a mobile phone cap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer up to date in the equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators started to tear down the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau – Iller opens new dormitory
About 4.6 million euros were invested in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works remained within the planned framework - both temporally and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which let the inhabitants experience the freedom to be able to move even without foreign help.
Similarly, Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the Social Administration of the Swabian District, said: "The house is geared to the special needs of its inhabitants who need resources to be mobile."
The comfort and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this position is a real stroke of luck, because it cannot be acquired in this way in today's situation".
In total, the new dormitory in Münsterblickstraße on almost 1500 square meters offers space for 30 people with disabilities, who are divided into three residential groups.
Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time workers who are all employed according to tariff.
Germany: Schwesig complains differences between East and West
Berlin - Prior to the Day of Unity, the deputy SPD president Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to reconcile themselves with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that pain after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, "said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the" Tagesspiegel am Sonntag ".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people in West Germany, but would receive 15 percent less salary.
"I cannot explain this to anyone almost 30 years after the German Unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan's hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyöngjang has made South Korean President Moon Jae a gift to two North Korean pungsan and hunting dogs.
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday, the two approximately one year old dogs reached their recipient already on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food in order to facilitate the "acclimatisation" of the animals.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced the friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korea ’ s leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to join international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply jointly for the holding of the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket engines.
Austria's turbulent history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of commemoration, numerous new books have appeared, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the splendid "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to the factual work - that is the unofficial motto for the work week of the Grand Coalition that begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU at last did not convey the "return to work" mantra-like.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the justified question, which is actually the difference between work and factual work, but be it.
When the Federal Government is now ready to rededicate itself to its task - to governing - it should not now be stopped with conceptual debates.
Whether Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blamagen of the last weeks, may already show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties come together to the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all this dispute.
At first, however, conflict-prone issues are on the agenda again with diesel retrofits and the expert immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to get rid of the car containers with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers as obligatory for technical retrofitting of older diesel.
While there has been a rapprochement over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned immigration law.
The SPD calls for a long-term perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is firmly opposed to the 'change of direction' from the asylum system into the labour market.
So there will again be arguments among coalition partners - and how else should it be?
Not equal and equal has joined forces with the GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society so diverse, sometimes contradictory, does not progress.
In order to be constructive, however, quarrels must not be broken up again for party-tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
It is still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD are supposed to argue - but always have in mind the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful for many?
With this guiding question, both diesel and lane change can be pragmatically clarified - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, it is for this reason that the people's parties must now fight.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister for Foreign Affairs
Does the Minister of Labour, of all people, violate the law of service in force?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" their leaders had worked on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
On the list of the fungus Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, Beate Hartinger's statement "Klein" (Freedom Party) is amazed - she now brings the matter to Parliament via request.
She assumes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and not to announce violations of the current right of service in front of current cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to "clear Hartinger of any suspicion".
Police rips a street in search of women's corpses
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route is closed in the area of Marxgrün until Monday.
It had been preceded that the investigators had previously used an archaeological dog.
The dog, who was specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was able to limit the relevant place to a few meters together with his guide in multiple operations.
In addition, a ground anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Supreme Bavarian Monument Protection Authority in the area of the said road piece.
For more than a year already, prosecution and criminal court have been dealing with the misfortune.
Again and again a bicycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators assume that in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago Heikes body could have been buried here.
Colour powder and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But already before it comes to Krawallen.
The separatists have not forgotten the autumn 2017 police operation.
Barcelona - Soon before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked, among other things, by the independence advocates with color powder when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the national police and the civil guard.
Around 3000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who were deployed in the polling stations last year in the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
There was also violence at the time when people were trying to prevent the vote.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the around 6000 separatists would have tried to break through the police chain by force, and the officials would have thrown paint bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people have been arrested and 24 others have been slightly injured, according to the authorities.
On Monday, the independence referendum will be held for the first time.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, continue to be in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the compulsory administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gathered perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate without a goal
Red White Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
Also at FC Gütersloh it was enough only to a 0: 0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion they turned out to be the third last and the third last.
The first half was very manageable by the entertainment factor.
Those who would prefer to get a beer or a sausage could do so without worry.
There was no danger of missing a goal chance, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
In the 28th minute Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire match.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle only real - possibility, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalie Frederic Westergerling forced after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty space boundary to a parade.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters straight over the housing and after one hour also the Gütersloher appeared for the first time offensively.
After a conquest of Matthäus Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62.) "crowned" Sinan Aygün's speedy performance with a lazy shot into the arms of RWA goalie Bernd Schipmann.
Furthermore, they played with a Wieckowicz (66th) club after a corner ball by former Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA Interim trainer Angelo Daut reacted, brought first Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It did - nothing.
The Ahlener did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but that did not bring anything.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero", but unfortunately the zero also stood in front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede and although our opponent did not want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
offensively "everything was so a bit" against a team that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I did not feel that we could get an opposite, "Daut said.
As a spectator, however, one did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
But the idea was too meager.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for whom these donations are intended, are pleased.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening the sky was bright blue, the place was still a little empty, but that should change during the day.
Because: "Here it is so beautiful sociable, therefore we are here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a neat pinch of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who should actually be weighed up against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) became ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" did not allow itself to entertain musically the ever increasing number of visitors.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a later hour.
"Just great", Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer could accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased about the many active ones with their stands, among them mainly clubs.
"Actually there should not be anything like a table", he thanked nevertheless for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those who were deployed at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean Up" campaign.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful paint - here something goes.
Then the Maikranz was taken by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarters.
Many stalls were used for physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for one year, became creative in his decorative saw.
He offered veneer works, beer covers with Reckenfelder motifs and much more.
A specialty offered three Reckenfelder beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought with them by Maria and Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Since the little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that allowed the visitors to linger for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricants with local political message: No successful advertising for skate equipment
In Lengerich, unknown people have hardly conducive to promoting the construction of a skate facility.
In several places there are corresponding lubricants, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration on request of the WN.
At least one case has been filed with the police for damage to property.
The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are written in large letters on signs at the Gempt and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the trade fair on 19 September a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt bistro had been discovered.
Since the short message apparently was left "only" with an edding at the time, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, it was back, this time sprayed", Rottmann said.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization is also to be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those companies that stand on the blackboard.
Local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skating equipment for years.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The majority of the Council voted in favour of the fire station.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
A turnaround followed at the end of June.
The members of the main and financial committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word was given by the City Council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, the German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, to the German Press Agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known shortage of European air navigation services, for which there is no rapid solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training for new pilots will take four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Europe-wide, the market for fully trained pilots was emptied.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various air traffic unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic city to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work condensation and overtime, this will not be possible without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members of the German air traffic control system.
Maas once again made the EU ’ s Commission responsible for the Lotsen Misere.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost requirements and personnel savings for national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to stand up for regulations in Brussels that "do not pull the air off".
At present, the EU ’ s benchmarks are being agreed by 2024 and there is a fear of further tightening up.
The EU is constantly under pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair's head Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high delays incurred by airlines will lead to a change of mind.
The GdF would only contribute to improving the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offered a "coherent training and future pact", said Maas.
The previously announced inclusion of 120 pilots per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary personnel development is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Group Supervisory Board votes for group conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans to rebuild the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp Chief Interim Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, the critical group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are said to have their headquarters in Essen and to be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the supervisory body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees face this.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include among other things the 50 percent stake in the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business with lifts and deliveries is to be bundled.
Barcelona: Violence in demos of policemen and Catalan advocates of independence.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan supporters of independence in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the municipality, about 3000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday and about 6,000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a large group to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
According to the forces, however, supporters of independence repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officials with paint and throwing shots.
According to the information, there have also been fishing between the participants of the various protests.
According to rescue personnel, 24 people were injured.
The police said that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who, almost exactly a year ago, opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation for the Spanish police to demonstrate in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55 year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they have drowned us a year ago.
A 31 year old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who wanted to give his name only to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who last year only did their duty: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke", the policeman assured.

Football: Juve Coach praises for top part: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese star striker had "played the best match this evening together with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3: 1 (1: 1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach the expensive purchased star was also without own goal the decisive man in the important game against the follower.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and makes it good," said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to the three goal templates of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early gap through the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and suspended the worst follower for the time being.
The Real Madrid driver first set up the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26. / 49.).
And Ronaldo also did the preparatory work for the goal of head of defense Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the champion of both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to be even better in serving him," demanded the coach.
Best juve goaltender is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the supremacy of Juventus seems to be even more overwhelming.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in the series A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six counters ahead of Naples.
The second table, which was trained by the former Bavarian coach Carlo, was not without chances against Turin.
But at the latest after the place-reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top part was decided.
The Portuguese had to get into the square after a hard climb against Paulo Dybala with Yellow Red.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German national champion has prevailed at Juve.
The professional from Liverpool FC was in use in all seven league matches.
The middle field player also played against Valencia in the Champions League match, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo flew off the course in the 2-0 round victory of the Turinists and is locked up for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Netanyahu West Changes His Name
With a particularly bizarre appearance, rappers have attracted attention at the U.S. TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided frown and question marks for the spectators.
The 41 year-old also announced a change in name on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, one may only call him "Ye", according to the musician.
"The essence, which was formerly known as Netanyahu West," he twittered in reference to the late singer Prince, when he took his stage name.
However, the pseudonym is not news.
Already the tenth album appeared under this name.
In an interview with radio station KRRL the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means" you ", according to the rapper.
Football: A1 Münster: Finally!
Created!
Hoetmar ’ s coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more handy, we never put it before problems ". Accordingly, the list of Hoetmarer bullets reads thin.
Grade times two goal chances in 90 minutes, with it only rarely games can be positively shaped.
Football A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
Also the SG had only two possibilities in the first round, but the first one used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preparations from Krause he knelt freely.
The hosts had only a double possibility when Moritz Höne failed at the beginning of the game and Jan Blome found his master in the final shot in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all gave up.
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide poked the ball over the line was the match decided (81.).
"We had criticized ourselves hard before, that was different today than in the last weeks", was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0: 1 Krause (7.), 0: 2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75. / Hoetmar).
Football: A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3: 4
"I don't know what to think about it," he said.
"We didn't have access to them at all." He presumably meant the wing-pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kroeger, but also all the other greens and whites, who came up with a collective attack.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking freshly and pulling his players from there, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Remember, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely, Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the championship.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best seasonal performance," he says.
"How we get back after 0: 2, how we keep against one of the league's top league teams over the whole season, that was really phenomenal".
It seems all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top player Lars Zymner brought the hosts into the lead with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He put the 2: 0 over the left side as a model for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but such a player cannot be taken out completely.
"That was madness, what he did," Lewandowski acknowledged the opponent's quality without jealousy.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own eleven managed to compensate: McGill ’ s left leg sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goaltender Hinkerohe into the long goal (45th).
After the change of sides, it was McGill again who scored the balance (59.).
Afterwards it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann from (69.).
In spite of abundance, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia round (80th).
We now need to focus fully on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we need to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Goals: 1: 0 Zymner (24.), 2: 0 Fröhning (39.), 2: 1 McGill (45.), 2: 2 McGill (59.), 3: 2 Nübel (64.), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Red: Atalan (74. / Albachten).

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Celebrities and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France ’ s President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he would personally pick up the tolerance price in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing ’ s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was a guest there.
For example, Academy Director Udo Hahn took him into account when he proudly said: "All federal presidents and Chancellor were already with us". However, the fact that celebrities repeatedly appear at the Academy in Schloss Tutzing was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker takes part in a meeting on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on 29 September the writer Frido Mann is at a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised that he will personally receive the "Tolerance Award" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The 80 or so meetings until mid-2019 are in themselves.
"The pension is just not sure!" stands in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria:" barbarism without limit ".
Weapon deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks any humane idea ".
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitisation.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to seek solutions or at least partial solutions".
At a conference on 200.
Birthday of Karl Marx the one more visitor to the direction of capitalism expects criticism, the other more a tendency "from left-wing to center".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music Cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner decided to communicate gender, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat at the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes even comes to the end of the movement, on the other hand, a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies in such a congenial harmony that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, as it suited the red thread of the evening.
There, Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction with the man comes when he has a partner, but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner does not bring any benefit.
The piano Solo now demonstrates itself: What would have emerged from the composing of Mozart, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Lied vom Tod", and from Mozart's g -Moll -Symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "bravo" from the full hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to Chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take an additional thanks.
She had the idea to give the duo not only appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt but also one in Wolbeck.

Handball: Women's team: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahleninnen had problems above all with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
"Actually, I was happy with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We did not get a grip on them, "says ASG Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many opportunities.
This time his team missed the concentration at the end.
Therefore the ASG ran almost to the end a backlog, was at the break with 11: 12 and later still with 15: 18 (45.) behind.
Only towards the end did the wider bank of the hostesses make itself decisively noticeable.
Furthermore, Aydogdu placed Merle Klement on the left, which then "made the decisive goals extremely clever" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. Liga Frauen: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the BSV Ostbevern volleyball players have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
VC Allbau Essen won the Blue Whites with 3: 1.
"This was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked on this, "said coach Dominik Münch after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the crashed premier league.
The guests dominated the first passage almost at will.
About 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12 he went with 25: 15 to the runner-up of the previous year.
Essen has accepted in the two-bar but has not come into play.
We did it well.
Our opponent opened up with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12: 8. "Essen has changed the assumption to Dreierriegel.
We could not keep the print.
Food has sucked up, and we ’ ve let ourselves be a bit lulled, ” Münch continued.
At 18: 17 the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had their first nose in front.
Although Ostbevern defended four set balls at 19: 24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a better class," said the trainer to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed substantially to the fact that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly".
About 7: 3 and 15: 13 brought the Blue and White Passage four with 25: 22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was elected the most valuable player, but also Maren Flachmeier had caught an excellent day.
Women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch and Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Municipality: Mosque - Opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne left a pile of shards in the German Turkish relationship, which can only be laboriously brought together," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance for a common, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing the Muslims' affiliation to Germany side by side with German leaders, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The extensive exclusion of the German public has "strengthened many reservations".
Heimatverein Osnabuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break Folktreff is finally time again.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 pm, the Heimatverein Nottuln is organizing its fifth Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost to the day exactly it is then one year ago that we conducted for the first time a Folktreff.
In the meantime this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar of events ", says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Osnabrück Heimatverein.
I wouldn ’ t have thought that our Folktreff established itself so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether storm deep Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"As always, the programme at the next Folktreff is a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and seaman songs, folk songs, evergreens and old percussionists," says Karl and Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friends of musicians to Louisiana.
For the first Folktreff- "birthday" Klaus Spellmeyer promised with his accordion.
He was a member of "Gaitling" for many years, a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with German lyrics.
Now he is on the road with an Irish and Folk band.
The creators of the Folktreff are happy to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" enthused the audience and sent them home with an earworm.
"We count on many happy guests to spend a convivial and humorous evening again," says the invitation of the Heimatverein.
Those who play an instrument and want to participate actively are invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always quickly occupied, it is recommended to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 pm, but admission is already at 7 pm.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step on their way to becoming the world ’ s largest industrial gas company.

This means that the merger will still be subject to approval in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA.
According to an insider, the chances of agreeing to an agreement had improved, because Linde agreed to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125 th anniversary of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger Hall.
On 29 September 1893, the last founding impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
At that time, he was still different: as a "district self-building association Kulmbach Stadt und Land", he was baptized by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
Also the purpose of the fruit growing association differed from today's work - it was actually pure about fruit growing, about flowers and horticulture nobody thought about at that time.
"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained district nurse Günter Dippold in his keynote speech.
Fruit trees should line highways, so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.
The fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A near-natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village embellishment and nutrition play an equally important role as the imparting of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Moles" showed entertaining on stage how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said Günter Reif, president of the district, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The collection of chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect similarly much joy with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary together with District Administrator Klaus Peter Söllner.
"Wherever they are to stand, the district association decides", added District Administrator Söllner and emphasized the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The county association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county left no doubt about it also district manager and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the district association and reported among other things about the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was lost.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature exists, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves towards it", the expert argued for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore there is the incentive for the horticultural associations not to let down so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our associations, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian State Association.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower glasses of the Thurnau music association.

Nafta's priority talks: Canada's Foreign Minister relocates UN's speech
Mexico ’ s government wants clarity on Nafta: they are making both trading partners an ultimatum for agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Canadian Secretary of State Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York because of the time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico.
Instead of speaking to the United Nations General Assembly this Saturday, the Minister told Adam Austen.
In the meantime, she concentrates on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Minister of Economy Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada ’ s and the US negotiators would have 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to enter into the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the US.
The US and Mexico agreed in August on a revision of the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been running for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time), they are now to be finalised, and Trump ’ s government wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico ’ s designated President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, left the hospital.
According to a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo", the far-right Ex Military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where it lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63 year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on an open street in early September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went on the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), especially women's associations had called for protests against the former Military Forces.
Also in the social networks the associations made against Bolsonaros racist and woman despising statements mobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia the protests were mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers ’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to stand.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As former mayor of São Paulo, Haddad was far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in surveys.
While the “Trump of Brazil ” has been interfering in politics for a long time, it has recently emerged as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round of elections reaches the absolute majority, there will be a run-off on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from this - no matter who he opposes.
Bolsonaro is known for his inciting homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964 – 1985).
He repeatedly shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula ’ s left-wing workers ’ party should be shot.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.

The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen had become famous with the band Gasolin ', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978 Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as a "street boy" who "was against everything, but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy's opponent Larsen had appeared on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rocknacht in der Schuhfabrik: Volume at Presslufthammerniveau
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger". Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure of three bands with friends.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians take even more time for a group photo.
There is no trace of stage fever.
Afterwards, the rockprotagonists from Ahlen and surroundings - all together with the booking-agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - excite with their bands the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" -Rocknacht visibly.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince at the start of the concert evening also with newest, unknown pieces from own pen and the forthcoming CD.
In front of the stage, a harmonious and powerful interplay of the band is danced during the performance.
Although "encore" calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that Hardrock is not the same as Hardrock with its alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock from the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is used at "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates by the change from melodic passages to the guitar heavy rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has, however, gained a special reputation since its founding in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
It is obvious and unmistakable that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China of 2017.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents with the band in the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
For the sound, which is even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a highly acclaimed solo while he runs through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of it at such a Hardrock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht the according to the information of the mixing desk of the team at the three-night concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of compressed air chambers, but it is still clearly below the excavations of the "Wack-Fesitvals", to refer to the "The Ignition" on their website.
Ear numbing 120 decibels in jet engine loudness as usual with the annual metal counterpart in the north of the republic, the Ahlener audience does not need on this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking gang have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger", all three groups, of course in the figurative sense, can say in the end.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

Toter bei Segelflugzeugunfall at the airport Essen / Mülheim
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim / Essen airport.
A glider crashed on Sunday in a parking lot at Mülheim / Essen airport.
The pilot died during the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near the airport Mülheim / Essen.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider had crashed at the airport on the exhibition site.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the pilot was alone on board - the plane is supposed to be a one-seater.
The plane was already in the landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is only a short distance from a festival tent on the airport grounds.
But since this weekend an Oktoberfest takes place.
The airport Mülheim / Essen is located on the city border of the two Ruhr district cities and directly at the driveway to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park & ride offer at large events in the fair Essen or the Gruga indoor hall in Essen.
Trump heavens to Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that, despite the nuclear crisis, the US president of North Korea Kim is well off.
But Trump has now made a genuine declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72 years, the married US president has become known for a new flame.
The tragic: It is a distant relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korea ’ s leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US federal state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-so-old offspring of Pyöngjang ’ s dynasty, although it turns out to be quite tough in the struggle for North Korea ’ s nuclear disarmament.
“I was tough, he too, and it went back and forth between us, ” Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the talks with Kim would have made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump pointed to Kim ’ s announced halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service.
That the affection for the infamous “Rocket Man ”, Trump ’ s nickname for Kim, for his martial threatening gestures, may not be everyone ’ s own, seemed to be well aware of the US president.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of his appearance in a large Wheeling sports hall: “Donald Trump says they have fallen in love. ”
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That is so unpresidential.
But he doesn ’ t care much about it, Trump explained, and then turned his index finger to the crowd: “I have always told you that it ’ s so easy to be presidential. ”
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there pushing into this crowded arena, but we would have only 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bestens visited, atmospheric as well as pampered by the sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair Baesweiler's city center has cleaned out on Sunday.
For the first time the Oktoberfest took place not only in the marquee at the fire brigade tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have referred to their catastrophic conditions of detention in Libya using a mobile phone.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal city of Savija in July and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers" whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video he brought himself into danger of life according to his own statement.
One of his comrades was beaten almost to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the conditions of detention were disastrous: "They beat us all with tubes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back home this year with the help of the program, said the IOM spokesperson in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of Nigerians now rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
He had not heard about a call for help by mobile phone.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

Around 4: 50 p.m. the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the vestibule of the first floor she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot yet be said.

German was caught in his own car for days
A 75 year old had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in Middle Franconia, after he had stuck the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
On Saturday afternoon, police accidentally discovered the car near a pasture and freed the missing car since Tuesday evening, the police reported on Sunday.
The 75 year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his off-road vehicle across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive searches, the whereabouts of the man remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW premier Armin Laschet (CDU) called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This mainly concerns wave of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this ".
According to Laschet, the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey were also addressed.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the Federal Defence Ministry ’ s readiness to fly at Cologne Airport at short notice.
Originally it had to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the owners of the castle had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their interlocutors - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of underlining the success of the denuclearization negotiations in North Korea, the East Asian regime is sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to meet.
North Korea ’ s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the US government of blocking the negotiations for a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons with her continued sanctions during the UN General Debate.
"The recent stalemate is due to the fact that the US is building on coercive measures that are deadly for confidence building," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that North Korea could "bring punishment to its knees" is "a dream of people who do not know us".
However, in order to build confidence, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri stressed.
However, there were no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have recently urged the United Nations to adhere strictly to the sanctions.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea ’ s leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will once again travel to Pyöngjang for talks on the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing of it with: White blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the crop thanksgiving.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the director of the HoT, recalls.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break the bad surprise came: A power failure had put the huge, two-part fridge out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the beginning: We got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it on their own," says Westbuer.
And so everyone took part.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"It can't be better for cooks either," praised a visitor impressed, while Hokkaido was served pumpkin soup or guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said Rev. Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen was amazed by the cartoons and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves North Rhine-Westphalia board
Out of frustration at criticism from their own ranks, Jörg Sartor, head of the Essen blackboard, has left his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide, because the Essen table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice-President of the NRW boards, Sartor said to the "World on Sunday".
I have fallen too many in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the regional association of North Rhine-Westphalia, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy to the dpa.
The sharp criticism Sartor took away.
"I can understand his step - people have expressed themselves, who did not know exactly why the Essen table does that".
But Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes there", says Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other boards in the "Welt am Sonntag".
One should not pursue the approach "without us the people in the city starve".
It is up to the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not attend a congress of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"Too much sweet stuff is told to me," he said.
There are all those social fuzzis that criticised me at the time.
SF Lorch verspielen 2: 0 - Gmünder Tagespost
2: 3 - TV Heuchlingen gewinnt in Kirchheim nach Rückstand - Bettringen schlägt Lauchheim klar.
With 2: 0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV newcomer - at the end it was 2: 3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
Very different from the TV Heuchlingen: In Kirchheim the TVH quickly got into the rear with 0: 1, but won after 90 minutes with 2: 1. Meanwhile, the SGB could win with a 3: 0
Gladbach playful two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2: 2 the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first victory of the season (1: 0).
(sda) Schalke maneuvered four times in the first five league games with early counterparts.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the strength with which it had finished first in the last season behind the Bavaria.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home quipe in the eleventh minute after strong preparatory work by Yevgeni Konoplyanka, subsequently conserving the mini-cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund welcomes again from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had reached a 0: 2 deficit against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came to the 4-2 victory in the second half.
James Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) compared with a double in four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63. Minute, provided with another double in the final (86. / 94.) for the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
For the first victory came also VfB Stuttgart.
In the meantime, Stuttgart had to contend with Werder Bremen, which had already been decimated before the break because of a yellow red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron Robert Zieler fabricated a curious insertion of the property, which helped to compensate the guests in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not have a completely successful but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave a lead twice, played in the end 2: 2 and are still waiting for a away victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen and his second Bundesliga player were responsible for Wolfsburg ’ s compensation for 1: 1.
Yann Sommer was powerless at the flat shot of 20 metres of the Aargau, as well as at the second opposite after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
For the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory match, the French record purchase from the OGC Nice hit Wolfsburg.
After seven laps Gladbach takes the 4th place.
Within 40 minutes the previously undefeated Werder Bremen maneuvered itself against the VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable situation.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart match, which the former president Luganesi Anastasios Donis concluded with his first goal of the season. After 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to win his team: the 23 year-old Serbe after a jersey match against Daniel Didavi Yellow and Red.
Although Stuttgart ’ s defenseman Borna Sosa and goalie Ron ’ s Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back into play by a curious injection of the property (68.), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the supremely active Stuttgart back onto the winning road.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3: 0 sovereign for itself.
After half an hour Hanno Behrens already put the home team on course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million people are voting today to change the name of their country to northern Macedonia.
With a yes, the nearly three decades of smouldering conflict with Greece ’ s neighbor could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a change of name because of its northern province of the same name and had blocked any approach of Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future of Western integration.
The US had announced that NATO could quickly become a member of the country with a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians in U-detention.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three pensioners and injured them in part.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted in Alsergrund on Friday at about 10pm.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who started with clenched fists on passers-by and tried to attack them, about his behavior.
Then the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officials.
Shortly afterwards, it turned out that the suspect had shortly before hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists at a tram stop in Währinger Straße.
He also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussion.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for unknown cause", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and continuously monitored during the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the answer on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper that a registered civil partnership had not been considered.
"If we marry, then right." He has been with his partner for 25 years.
Kahrs, 55 years old, is a spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals on 30 June 2017, Kahrs had caused a sensation with a would-be speech.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling away" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski's moment," he said in reference to the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexual couples.
Prior to that, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the civic association Kinderhaus and the society for leprosy.
Because about 400 meters hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, President of the Citizens' Association.
And it has also accumulated so much.
Because of the hot summer we are late this time, but luckily it is now only a form cut.
Because already in the spring the hedges have been sheared.
The breakfast always following the work also has a long tradition.
"Everyone should remain with his strength," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Kanuslalom World Cup
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg won the gold medal at the end of the Canadian Slalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old passed a perfect race on Sunday on the Olympia round.
Two years ago he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had already enough rides here on the plant and it has fit everything today ", said the Olympic third of London 2012.
At the finish he threw away his paddle with joy and raised both arms in a confident way - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pavel Eigel.
The Gauting police inspection reports the first attempt to break into a single-family house this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to use this again.
The Gauting police inspection yesterday reported the first attempt to break into this autumn.
It is thanks to the alarm system that it remained at the attempt at the single-family house on Königswieser Straße.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday shortly before 8 pm.
The burglar suspected that the inhabitants were not at home.
The alarm system obviously surprised them so much that they fled without prey.
Notes to PI Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Default at Hertha: Obtained from reality: Bavaria demanded against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bayern "not to be pleased".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate term for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small performance delle under the new coach Niko Kovac should not increase for the Munich to a bigger autumn low.
"A week ago we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we got a little bit of reality, "Thomas Müller stated after the deserved 0: 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions ’ League ’ s duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are giving gas towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal has been scored abroad, as at the same time of the previous season two compulsory games in series without victory, the championship lead in the football Bundesliga at first lost to Borussia Dortmund.
While the overall situation is far from as dramatic as it was at the end of Carlo ’ s failure at the end of September 2017, the penalty must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at the 1: 1 with his running intensive man and against him and the Berliner due to their playful needle stitches over the outside delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last super-powerful Bavarians are to be cracked after all.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," said Kovac.
Otherwise, however, he walked around with his losers in his native city surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the once again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first intermediate term of his term of office positive - otherwise the tone might worsen.
For example, Kovac did not take exceptional measures before the second king class appearance this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday the short preparation for the second round match against Ajax begins as planned, which had also conquered AEK Athens with 3: 0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place spoke above all Joshua Kimmich clear text.
The right-wing defender acted as a reminder.
“I don ’ t think that ’ s all bad luck, we also have to work it out again, because we don ’ t make the many chances and make the mistakes at the back ”, stressed the 23-year-old just before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh round of the previous season, the Bavarians were already five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with one point advantage.
And so Kimmich valued at least positively with a wink that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the player.
It is good for the league.
DFB ’ s Boss in Shot Line: Causa: Erdogan ’ s Sharp Attack on Grindel
Turkey ’ s President Erdogan denounces with grave accusations the exclusion of Ilyay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB ’ s president Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the line of association.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for the sovereignty of interpretation in the duration of the dispute.
After the Turkish President strongly criticised the handling of the former World Champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB leader defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning, Grindel, who had been attacked in person, announced consequences from the causa in the Mainz "Sports Studio".
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many migrant players in the U-teams - that something like this is not repeated," said the 57 year-old and wants to win a candidate without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan was not in favour of the values of football and the DFB.
The latter had denounced a racism with sharp words in respect of Ilyay Gündogan and Ilyay Gündogan.
Our born and grown up in Germany and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they took pictures with me in England, "Erdogan said in the cathedral city on Saturday.
Honestly, as its president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan ’ s statement that he felt "handled reasonably by the DFB" in contrast to the FIFA World Cup affair, which had started with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced his intention to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended more, I have always said.
But he does not see a basis for a return of Özils to the national team.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is to be appointed.
"If someone without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says:" The subject is important, we have to take care of it ", this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration must work", said Grindel.
In spite of the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the offensive affair, he wants to stand for the post as DFB ’ s president again next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as possible," said Grindel.
Year end builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg / Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75 year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
The 75 year old driver was first approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
But there was no personal exchange, because the 75 year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who would have departed from the road and driven against a lead post.
The man did not want to see the police on the spot and then drove away.
Afterwards the Rödentaler went home.
However, the pensioner in his place of residence, in which he has lived for decades, has proceeded and rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Finally, the police could find and stop him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could no longer remember much.
The damage is about 1300 Euro.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still almost 1000 volunteers in operation.
Approximately four weeks after the eruption of the moor fire on a federal military site in Emsland, 980 volunteers are still busy with the fire extinguishing work.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
According to one speaker, the situation continues to develop stable, and 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of volunteers is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which was proclaimed a good week earlier on 21 September, because it was feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements at risk by wind and sparks.
Thursday it was said that the fire would no longer threaten to spread to adjacent communities.
At times, more than 1500 volunteers tried to control the major fire on site.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehrtestgelände near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire had been triggered by test missiles launched by Airbus ’ engineers.
The smoke flag of the moor fire had temporarily moved up to a hundred kilometers far over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the answer on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper that a registered civil partnership had not been considered.
When we get married, then right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
Kahrs, 55 years old, is a spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals on 30 June 2017, Kahrs had caused a sensation with a would-be speech.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling away" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski's moment," he said in reference to the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexual couples.
Prior to that, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Approximately 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called Northern Macedonia in the future.
Thereupon exists because of its homonymous northern province of the neighbor Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO.
If citizens vote in favour, they will also launch their country ’ s Western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The Author who Saves the Shoah from Forgetting

The Nobel Peace Prize winner of 1986 dies in 2016 in the USA and leaves behind a work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that institutions can only be removed with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland is starting an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
People who want to provide their organs in case of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be accessed by Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that institutions can only be removed with explicit consent, as in Germany, stresses Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Foundation Swisstransplant.
But only in five percent of the cases a card is found at the crucial moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome", so Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the speaker of the Federal Agency for Health Education, Marita Völker, says.
"A register in which people can register their wishes - pro or kontra organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would be regarded as an organ donor, unless he or she contradicts.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14 year old pupil is world champion in headcount
The 14-year-old pupil Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in headcount.
On the weekend in Wolfsburg he prevailed against 39 comrades.
This was announced by Martina Flamme and Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve year old Japanese student, the oldest a 74 year old pensioner from France, as main arbitrator Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which participants started against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings were already present two years ago as 14 year old in Bielefeld.
Organiser Laue can do little with terms like superbrain, genius or prodigy.
"Calculation can be exercised," he said.
Many participants practised several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stage-oriented computing competitions.
One of the disciplines is, for example, square-root drawing from six-digit numbers.
In terms of versatility calculations, the candidates get surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans would have good chances, said the main arbitrator.
Otherwise Asians are often advantageous, because already in early childhood head calculations are learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Urgent appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer - Early detection
Tennis Ass Serena Williams shows off her sensitive and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer and stand up for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate parts.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died from it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, where breast cancer is about early detection, which can save lives.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia there were complications.
A distress surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clumps were discovered in Serena ’ s lung.

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise blue coalition will send a corresponding draft law on the so-called "symbols of the law" in consideration.
This will significantly extend the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Mrs. Holle shakes her beds in the west for the first time next week: Polare cold air reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit falls to 1,500 to 1,200 metres at the beginning of the week. In narrow valleys, it could snow down to 1,000 metres at a high intensity.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore winter.
Farmers are allowed to start their annual buckling on Monday
Schleswig Holstein ’ s farmers are allowed to start their annual buckling care on Monday.
The "green ramparts", unique in Germany, have characterized the landscape of the forest-poor federal state for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide hedges are "forest replacement" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats, over which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the nature conservation association Germany (NABU) in Schleswig Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The knicks were fixed on the basis of a command of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and livestock fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates from that time: by "bend" of the branches the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, some 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North and the Baltic Sea and give the picture of a landscape rich in wood and diverse in structure.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7000 species as a substitute habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in a kilometer crease and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise it declines to a light row of trees, which loses besides the biodiversity also the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, creasing care may only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about situation on site
In an interview with the German Editorial Network (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at that time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of them completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills where they are still afraid of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service has completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners sometimes walk around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many corpses around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information on the island work?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but it didn't work before and we only got information about the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who they do not know if they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but on the way to work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have information on this?
We don't know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought "OK, not a tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was a misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi lying on the Pacific Ring of Fire not prepared for earthquakes?
But, there are earthquakes every day, but that here was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuation.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit many people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must renounce Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo pulled a muscle fibre tear in the back left thigh at the 2-1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the soccer team announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a bundle of muscles in the thighs.
Both players are definitely no option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following country break.
VfB Stuttgart did not make a forecast for downtime.
A bundle rupture heals usually within six to eight weeks, a muscle fibre rupture heals usually somewhat faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - Every year, the San Sebastián Film Festival closes the ranks of the most prestigious European festivals.
In spite of all the hymns to the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

On Sunday morning, the fire brigade tried to capture an injured duck.
The action, however, lasted for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - On Sunday morning, a white, injured duck caught up walking along Olchinger Lake.
She stayed in the area of the water guard station.
To help the animal, passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
The first attempts to capture the duck, however, went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the forces again and again.
At the end she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat the fire brigade could circle the animal and push back on land, where it was then put after almost an hour by a fireman with a heartfelt handle into a transport box.
The duck injured on the breast was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Oberschleissheim.
But according to the first assessments, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlet Julian Eberhard beats World Cup medal
At Olympia, Biathlet Julian Eberhard was in the stomach for a long time.
In the coming winter the Saalfeldener wants to catch up with the missed precious metal at the World Championships in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old Pyeongchang Olympic sprint the medal close to grasp.
Seven tenths of a second were missing at the end on bronze.
"I took the time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym Fitness Studio in his hometown Saalfelden.
One medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgau is all the more motivated to catch up with the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point you have to hit.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I already put the track in my heart", he remembers with pleasure his fourth world cup place in the single race last year.

He finished second with the season in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI Investigation at Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
The Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the ultra-thin majority for the judges Brett Kavanaugh, who have been disputed for accusations of coercion.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline until Friday for investigators to clarify the alleged incidents that have occurred more than 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama about Kavanaugh ’ s calling, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and the first Prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the lawyer expelled angry tirades against opposition democrats, the Senate ’ s Justice Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the conservative judge at the US Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had still referred to the serious reprisals on Thursday as "bewilderment", initially abstained from further attacks on women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune".
In this way, last doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats for refusing Kavanaugh, “trying to block and destroy. ”
Trump Orders FBI Investigation in the Kavanaugh Case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One would specifically investigate the well-known accusations of two women, no longer, a government representative told the "Wall Street Journal": "They do not go on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device of the municipality of Ried, installed in a "civil vehicle", will be stationed on the garden road from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: Fear has been felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first victory of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
Nevertheless, the factor time played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our home game ", said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed.
After all, the royal blue had succeeded in bringing the scarce 1: 0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season under the roof.
It could have been otherwise.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco security Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playfully and from the pressing"., with increasing playing time obviously more and more the head played a role.
Does not actually create a beast
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand it."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore kept withdrawing.
And with man and mouse defended against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant share in it with his head ball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man-creates".
But in the end only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the early stages and make a firework out of it," said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to approach games over 90 minutes
Perhaps the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: royal blue missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry.
The possibilities were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59. / 72. Or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have become a trembling victory," Tedesco said, "You have already felt the fear a bit".
I am therefore glad that we have won.
He was not the only one to win.
Fischbachau: Rauchsäule im Leitzachtal 2 km visible

Prof. Dr. Aladin El Trudeau Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them stands the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El Moreover Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Kulturpolitik" in the direction of the evening.
El Moreover Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic comprehensibly.
With a lot of gestures, solid figures and one or the other joke, he brings the listeners one of the most conflicting issues: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table is the German society, at the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to get to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to co-determine.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it was not decisive whether one should classify oneself politically right or left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?", he emphasises.
In the beginning, the discussion is more and more lively.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among pupils.
The Mafaalani is in front, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is an interest in the subject, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says Mr Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing session, he still has an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, was intensively further discussed.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win kick-off games

Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is obviously huge: Over 100 prospective customers have applied for the purchase of one of the plots in Landsham.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land on the free market in the new Landsham region.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick says.
Furthermore, the application phase for those 20 plots which the municipality offers on more favourable conditions or prices is completed, similar to the previous domestic model.
A good 100 applications have been received, says Frick.
"Documents are currently being examined" with regard to application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieningen, the goal was to have prepared the candidates ’ ranking for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present them to the municipal council.
The award could then take place.
In total, 50 plots of land for single and semi-detached houses are created on the area in the south of Landsham as well as four plots for multi-family houses with probably eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and paths will soon be paved.
A single plot and two of the apartment buildings belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in the socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two apartment houses of the municipality are to be built as an affordable living space.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, housing for about 200 people is being created on the area of the new Landsham region.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start for the new construction of a daycare center takes place there.
It will accommodate three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Thus Schalkes Naldo succeeds "great sport" also on the bench
For the third time not in a row: Nevertheless Naldo thanks to Schalke ´ s coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues sat for the third time in a row on the exchange bench, not in the league, the understanding would have been great among many people, if the Brazilian, who is almost two meters tall, had really talked about the soul.
But when after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 the players of the league gathered as usual in the middle circle and thanked all his pros for head coach Domenico Tedesco, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for simplicity, turned on and said, "We have to thank, coaches!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his new reservist, did not have any resentment.
Probable Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best player, knows that he didn ’ t get on the track with his coach – but gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control".
It was not easy to tell him that
"It was not easy to tell him that, I tell you quite honestly," Tedesco reported of the moment when he told Naldo that he was not in the penalty box.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club, "Tedesco explained.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can take a breather at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat, "Tedesco explained the rotation, which has also caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself also on the bench as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria ’ s industry continued to decline in August compared to the eurozone.
The purchasing manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37 months step-up.
However, throughout Europe, Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, as announced by the Markit institute on Monday for its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is nevertheless the 13th month in a row below the mark of 50 points, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
They were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer sank, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened slope may mean that the worst is over," said Markit's economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as strongly as they have since November 2011.
The companies therefore removed jobs for the seventh consecutive month.
Industrial production also fell more strongly in China in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer decreased from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index relies on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in turnover, employment, warehouses and prices are raised.
Tuchels PSG ´ s team succeeds eighth victory in eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19: 45
Nice coach Thomas is still racing with Paris Saint Germain in France ’ s football championship from victory to victory.
At the OGC Nice the defending champion won with 3: 0 (1: 0) thanks to two hits of Superstar and was thus also successful in the eighth league match.

The Brazilian brought PSG into the lead after 22 minutes and produced the final position in the championship.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) provided for the intermediate 2: 0.
Thus, Paris also succeeded in the dress rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the premier league, Tuchels team had to accept the only compulsory match so far in Liverpool this season.
