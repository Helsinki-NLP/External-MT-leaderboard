Zmapp, a combination of antibodies, had a promising field outcome at first, but formal studies showed it was less beneficial than expected in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, the function of Zmapp was control, i.e. the scientists used it as a basis and compared the other three treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's note and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic family fosters a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of athletes, clubs and their sports can be better served by moving forward with meaningful changes within our organization, rather than withdrawing certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports independent research that may shed light on how the abuse of proportion that Larry Nassa's survivors so courageously described could have gone unseen for so long and accepts any necessary and appropriate changes.
The goal of USA Gymnastics and USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a protected, positive and empowered environment.

Besides confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory already widespread, it also offers specific data that fossils usually do not provide, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this animal has a brown plumage on the upper part and a pale or carotenoid hue on the underside.
The discovery also helps to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur plumage does not have a well-developed axis, called a rachis, but does have other features of feathers (pig and barb), the researchers concluded that the rachis is likely the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight, but was used to regulate temperature or as an indicator of temperature.
Experts found that even though the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the specimen illustrated the plumage of an adult rather than that of a chick.

Although it was a highly theoretical work, the program was written with the purpose of simulating observations made to the Sagittarius galaxy.
It would be the tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way that would cause the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way that the moon exerts a pulling force on our planet and causes tides.
The experts concluded that dark matter affects each other just as regular matter does.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo and is composed of numerous small particles.

Extremely resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African area of Zululandia.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant generated "much concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and that at least two of those infected were health workers at that hospital.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with whom he has had close contact.

"While their thermal behavior is not as regular as the large caves on our planet, which usually maintain a fairly stable temperature, it is consistent with these deep cavities in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the archaeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters are isolated in a cubicle and put into an envelope a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials confirm the identity of the person who is present to vote, the person enters the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law lays down the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have had to be transparent, allowing voters and observers to verify that there are no envelopes at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added other than those of those who vote, duly computed and authorized.
Candidates have the option of sending representatives to monitor each stage of the process and, overnight, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, 25 and 21 respectively, died, the latter driving.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider needed facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's gun got stuck while aiming at a fifth man's head. Schneider suffers permanent pain, cannot see with one eye, is missing a part of his skull, and his face had to be reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via a virtual link from a United States Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the championship apart from Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he scored a "No Finished First Run", as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she placed tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind first Austrian finalist Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes below ninth-place finisher Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four female skiers in the sitting category failed to complete their races and a total of 45 participants from 117 of the Giant Slalom failed to qualify in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police force was able to recover the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General, D.K. Arya, stated: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer".
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the home at the time of the car crash, none of them sustained injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services pulled the driver of the red Audi TT out of it.
He was initially transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh County Court, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, any eyewitness testimony may be questionable, as her image has been widely circulated.
It is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but because Scottish justice works differently, the courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: "It seems that journalists are walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecutions, told reporters that no further comments would be made at least until the auto of prosecution is dictated.
According to the leaked information, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve on the basis of the pre-1967 borders of the Middle East.
Other topics that were also discussed, reportedly, included the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA only accepts five.
During the supplementary pest control trial, rangers were to closely monitor the shooters, as this was monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
In a union between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., suitable volunteers were recruited within the sporting shooters' association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage office, said that comprehensive safety training and training was provided to the four shooters chosen for the shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in as a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
He's the fifth CEP of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the previous CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures aimed at leading the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's way of responding to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, sometimes violent, were provoked by the fact that no elections were held, in some cases since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with malfunction and overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported having registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company listed as "not serious".
The ministry pronounced on the delay in Apple's report, saying it was something "truly regrettable".
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Agency said there was no damage recorded on the national territory.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus and held captive tourists from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 on the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have been confirmed dead.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old woman because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began studying medicine.
She trained in obstetrics and joined the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began his research on preterm birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
Their study showed that the fetal lung maturation of the baby could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators managed to recover the flight recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow fighters also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman".
Dustin Gold in Dust Runnels stated: "Moona was as weird as I was; even, even more. I love her and will miss her. I hope she finds herself in a better place".
Since 2008, among the 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, there has been an 8 percent increase in those who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, interim prime minister, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once the term of Queen Elizabeth II is over.
34% of those polled share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
At one end of the poll are 29% who think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other, 31% who think it should never.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question following his complaints.
He hasn't been able to take pain medication, because it's forbidden to use it in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people checked the find using various types of hardware and software and in early February it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have provided water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets, especially our own, originated, since comets crashed into the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor at the start of the year and last month signed a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry.
He called the rumors "political talk and bobbery".
It is speculated that he will run for the presidential elections in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims would reduce airline route distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It employs satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate data to pilots.
No additional transport will be implemented and trains will not stop at Wembley.
Due to concerns about the lack of transportation, the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors, without the team's fans, was considered.
On Thursday, the magazine Science published a study reporting the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Experts at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, because of breeding between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and a migrating cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take all kinds of shapes and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it can also be stretched to a very fine wire that can twist and braid.
It can be made very thin and adhered to another metal, so thin that it can be achieved that it was used to decorate the hand-made illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make a pH indicator using cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the analyzed chemical determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of stripping a proton of its electron.
Shake both dry powders together and, after doing so, with your hands clean and wet, squeeze them to form a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in your hands and their outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, which were connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems have been found.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, public baths had toilets, and some were shared by men and women.
When you communicate with someone who is thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space, because light from Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision we have.
It takes a giant rocket, over 100 feet high, to take a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways, and the most important thing it's done for us is to give us a much simpler and faster mode of transportation.
It has enabled us to travel by rail, by car, and many other means of transport.
Below, there are more moderate-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including independent domestic cats) that feed on smaller species that exist in much larger numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of cats and spend their lives in large groups called herds.
Herds are made up of one to three adult males from the same family group, joined by up to 30 females and their young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds have the same behavior as wolves or dogs, with whom they bear a striking similarity (unlike other big cats) both in their behavior and in being highly lethal to their prey.
An all-around athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not too well), swim, make long jumps, and pull five times as hard as a sturdy person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These are the only four cats capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar is not a fully sounding one like the lion's, but rather a sentence of words uttered to growls and cries.
Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures, and when possible they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and most of their prey will be much smaller than their own size.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find food animals (prey) through smell, smelling the soil they've passed through.
They have excellent night vision and are also very nimble in their movements, and they hunt their prey by mimicking their surroundings and then leaping over them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) moves away from the main one from which they came (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily go back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they used to be accustomed to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations from those it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still needs the same adaptations as in the past.
Over time, as the nascent population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will be impossible to classify them as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and it is an inevitable and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (discharge).
The food plants generate from the sun's energy, thanks to photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build our homes out of plants, and we also make clothes out of them. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it feared nothing but others of its own species.
Its long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth embedded like knives, plus an additional group in the palate, which meant that anything that passed in front of it had no escape.
We don't know for sure, but he could have had the viperin, and his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he could even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a dinosaur as large as the T. Rex was a threat to it.
While most of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate certain unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and even a type of rodent, the liron.
Another difference was that the humble people and women ate sitting on a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and sitting aside while eating.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods as their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to meet the needs of those by holding ceremonies and festivals.
Temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that was only open to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the midst of the hot Middle Eastern climate, home was not of the utmost importance.
Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan had few large forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey further west, discovered the island and gave it his name.
Even so, despite their discovery, Eskimo tribes already inhabited the area by then.
While each country was Scandinavian, there were marked differences in people, monarchs, customs, and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might believe that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
While the back of the document contains some writing, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has the phrase Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776 written on its back.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that as soon as it was made, the huge parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added as a mere label.
Although the D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, the southern side still remained.
Their government was in the hands of the French of Vichy, who were a group who, in 1940, had made peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, Operation Dragon was launched, with the Allies invading southern France.
Within just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture that is made up of a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related both to the word civis, of the same language, which means citizen, and to civitas, which means city or city state and which, moreover, determines in some way the size of society.
The city-states are the precursors of nations.A culture of civilization entails a prolonged generation-to-generation transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy and a homogeneous spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and fail to be recognized as civilizations properly so called.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed, at first, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the congress was its only component.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since it had a national executive or judicial branch, the task lay with state authorities, who often did not cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
Nor was he empowered to overturn tax laws or interstate tariffs.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were usually absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the Germany national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, skating and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago on earth.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands it contains, Japan is usually referred to as an  archipelago, from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing through the area recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, that is, beautiful island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labor to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared the latter as a province dependent on the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War, (1894-1895), the Qing government adhered to the Shimonoseki Treaty, through which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the ends of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can visualize how they originally looked.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and work continues today.
For example, the most common global still image photography format is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size towards the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, its dimensional relationship has moved into the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, since its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, the dimension ratio of this format (divide by twelve to calculate the simplest ratio of integers) is said to be 3:2.
Many typical formats (verbigracia, the APS group of formats) are the same or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been constantly mocked and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that generates dynamism while allowing images to be ordered.
It indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed between the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had amassed wealth and power, was called into question.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had managed to unite European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone from the monarch to the common people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds be set aside for that specific function.
The central headquarters of the church had remained in Rome for over a millennium and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, such a measure violated generally recognized international law and was contemplated in various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain has drawn international waters in entire stretches of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
Having received a reduced response against this tactic, Germany expected to encounter a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920's, the attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems and a note of recommendation made by Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting different time periods. Each stage or family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which developed over 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles vying for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history was the Three Kingdoms period, when thousands died in a struggle to take the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Also, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
The same is true of the military, for instead of basing the army's ranks on classes, they now base them on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people of the repressed working class in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as Hira on the mountain of Noor (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which endured through time, illustrates in a very realistic way the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
On the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, lies a cave completely abstracted from the rest of the planet.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence.
Nothing is seen but the marvelous clear sky and the numerous mountains around it. From inside this cave, you can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the third century B.C., is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built to venerate the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Necropolis of Giza, in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many other similar, smaller tombs and temples were erected in honor of his wives and relatives.
The upward arc mark resembles a V and the downward arc mark is similar to a staple or square without its lower edge.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull this.
The upward movement of the bow produces a softer sound, while a descending one is louder and more cutting.
Feel free to make your own markings with pencil, but remember that the marks on the bow instruments were printed there for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced the terrified monarch Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, her two young children (Marie-Thérèse, eleven years old, and Louis-Charles, four) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob that shouted and threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a royal guard executed at Versailles in front of the queen, who was in a panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime for the purpose of paying off most of the expenses and interest on the bonds that floated on behalf of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
From now on, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The European historical period in which these events take place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between 1000 and 1300 A.D.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic that drives the destiny of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development itself unfolds in a way independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has effects on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one might argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily derives from the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a reduced volume of cars, so new manufacturing techniques are being devised to reduce the costs of owning a vehicle.
The massive use of cars also generates a higher incidence of traffic accidents, leading to the development of new techniques in the health field to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars such as Goether, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography developed that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered as such in feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and extended to around 1100 AD.
During the 12th century their status declined, mainly because, on their return, the crusaders brought gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of capital of fashion was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The height of the Gothic style took place in the period between the X-XI and the XIV centuries.
At first, the way of dressing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slowness of communication channels, Western styles could be delayed by about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began using buttons to tie their clothes.
Subsistence farming is defined as farming which aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family group.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic practice that combines the use of stored seeds originating from the ecological region with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, much of the main activity of farmers has been subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by social standards and give them the possibility to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of its members.
The traits that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographic, or be related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of their belonging to it by resorting to distinctive and symbolic use of style, such as fashions, gestures and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms for charting the importance of socialization is to analyze the few and regrettable cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced traumatic situations or severe child abuse before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals and some to have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, it exhibits behaviors (within its physical possibilities) almost in a whole equal to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique; rather, it is an assistance that provides support to those going through a new experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual formats; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but so is the little animated paper holder in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment without love, care and education; but it does happen.
We can sense that the foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving guardians, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The aim of family care is to cover all needs that were not met in the household from which you were previously taken.
The Internet combines and mixes components of mass and interpersonal communication.
The different features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal participation" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through video recording, important findings have been made in interpreting micorepressions, which are facial movements of only a few milliseconds duration.
In particular, it is claimed that by properly reading their microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can, nevertheless, accurately evaluate sincerity.
It even suggests that the abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century it has been shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination blur the variation between one generation and another generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plant resources available.
Moreover, failure to do so leads to serious problems - growth retardation, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
The proteins in leaves and legumes would have been the most easily accessible source of plant resources, but they are not easily digestible by primates like us, unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
In short, it should not surprise us if our own predecessors solved their "protein problems" in the same way as savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the intentional awakening during the normal sleep period and falling asleep after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be accomplished with a more or less gentle alarm clock that brings him back to a conscious state, though without waking him completely.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process.In some countries, you will need to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that rely on the biological rhythm are to drink plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, known to be a diuretic) before bed, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force we have, and each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all reach enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they were spread by the Mahayana path of love and numerous yoga techniques of India.
In general terms, secularism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the all-embracing path of love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment) is activated with yoga poses, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation is centered on Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels can be unblocked, chakras can be activated, and enlightenment consciousness can be developed.
Cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, clashes of system, process and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would spread over the next 40 years and be fought for real, through surrogate militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Because by 17 September 1939 the Polish defense was already broken, their only hope was to retreat and reorganize themselves in the extension of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, as more than 800,000 Soviet Union Red Army fighters entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's function has always been to ensure that its country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this.
At the same time, the German navy, using primarily submarines, was trying to cancel this circulation.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany might have seized power in Britain, as it did in other European countries.
It appears that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
In order to easily obtain their milk, hair, meat and leather, ancient peoples and tribes began to settle with them.
Domesticated goats were usually gathered in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd.
In England, railways had already been installed by the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the chariots were made of simple parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling on them to achieve greater speed and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat more rugged roads of the day.
The addition of sleepers to hold the rails in place was quite early, but gradually it was realized that rails would be more efficient if they were coated with iron on top.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused further wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 solid iron rails began to be used.
The first known form of transport was walking, which began in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While traces of bipedalism have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start to live a more planet-friendly life, join environmental movements, or even become activists and fight to lessen, in some measure, future suffering.
It's, in many cases, like asymptomatic treatment, but if you're not just looking for a temporary situation, you should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
Clearly, the world has undergone great changes as a result of mankind's technological and scientific advances, and problems have been intensified by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, which are now known as the Dunlap copies.
It was John Nixon who first read the document and did so in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his army in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 Dunlap photographs, which are known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document preserved.
A lot of paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Many people don't picture them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many features in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly, clawed limbs, lay eggs, and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Today, almost all computers operate on the basis of data manipulation encoded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be an open bottle of medicines or toxic chemical cleaning products.
Read the label for specific information on the first aid relevant to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with bedbugs, a species highly developed to parasitize humans.
Killer bed bugs and bed bugs are nesting bugs; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The number of registered cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States is about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, which links the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, is the target of multiple sclerosis.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may conclude that raising a baby would not be in their best interests or for the child.
These couples might choose to plan for a baby adoption.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
It is not, however, an experiment, it is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was on the classical works; especially, on the Latin version of the Bible text.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the dominance of the Greek language declined, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots in both philosophy and science.
Many rhythms in physiological processes and behaviour are often decisively dependent on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate self-sustaining and have a period of free cyclic operation, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of genetic-type material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They did two experiments where they marked the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether germ cells are involved, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, whereas those that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, which includes wildlife, animals and plants.
Some examples of possible activities at the site are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, taking pictures, and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and often run into others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Scientists now argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to human evolution for the past two million years.
They are all part of society and use the transport system; and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason for such complaints about transport systems and why do they fail every day?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and of the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study traffic flow, as it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, drivers tend to maintain relatively consistent behaviour, which allows traffic flows to have logical consistency and to be represented mathematically.
In order to more clearly chart the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Such relationships facilitate both the planning and design and the operations of road-side devices.
The first species to take flight were insects, which helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward, gluing them to the sides of their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Today, anise and ephemero are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite - that the solar system orbited the earth, including the sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since you don't feel it moving on Earth, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second largest river on the planet, containing eight times as much water as the next largest river.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, at some points reaching up to six miles in width.
Of the total water from the world's rivers that flows into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they were never surpassed by those at Giza, neither in size nor in the sublimity of the technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time dated back more than a millennium.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Italian is used in Vatican City, both for drafting its regulations and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language spoken daily by most of those working within the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City adheres to the Roman Catholic religion.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known since ancient times, since they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more similar to the states of matter (with identical order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, only at the same time, he had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
Alloys may also be present with small amounts of elements, such as carbon, that are not metals.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the end point of this sentence could contain billions of them.
So when the pencil was invented, it made a lot of friends.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods have been introduced, pencil is less used and has lost its status.
Today, people type messages on their computer screens. They don't even need to get close to a punchline.
One wonders what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when you drive a heavy wagon up a hill, and by splitting the core again, you release some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, meaning they tend to decay with minimal or almost no thrust.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more seas on the near side because their crust is thinner, which made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what attracts or likes people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment compel them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior that can occur when managers start leading their former peers.
Managers in this category have difficulty making decisions that displease employees, imposing disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities and demanding accountability from staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into an unrecognizable person who feels the need to modify everything the group has been doing so far and do it their way.
After all, the ultimate responsible for the success and failure of the team is the leader.
This behavior often ends up distancing the leaders from the other team members.
The same standards of excellence that conventional equipment handles apply to virtual ones, although there are slight differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their nearest physical group.
They generally have greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, thanks to the fact that their teams can meet in accordance with different time zones which, for example, may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The 'invisible team' is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports.
What reason could an organisation have for undergoing the complainant's process of establishing a learning organisation?One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organisational learning is to drive innovation.
When all available resources are appropriately used in the operational departments of an organization, there is room for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it is possible that the process of an organisation working as a team to overcome a difficulty may be replaced by a new innovative process in order to meet the needs of customers.
For an organisation to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as must shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumor affect behavior and cause changes in mental function.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we have the ability to see and investigate structures and processes that occur in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for developing simulation models, which further our understanding of mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a highly relevant specialty within computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behaviour.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and inquiries from clients, as well as facial, written, and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military sectors, as it was incorporated into various video game software applications and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of any classroom, and it is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from technology, through virtual tours, where students can observe objects on display in a museum, visit an aquarium, or contemplate beautiful artworks while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a webpage about their trip to the state capital and every year the page is updated, but the previous versions are kept online in the form of a memoir album.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills.Although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes when an audience is present.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger begins to work on improving his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also requires students to be more understanding of the world around them.The need to stimulate the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through active response to internet content, they can define their positions in the context of others' writings, as well as establish their perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivating bilingual capital and boasts a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the country's history and present.
Niagara Falls lies further south and the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and the expanse that follows.
All these aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian to foreigners.
Larger areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To make a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadians.
The location of the islands of East Africa is off the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was imposed, to a large extent, on the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial peak of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route linking Cape Europe with India.
The region borders the Sahel in the north, and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is advised that all female visitors state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (just make sure it does not look too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it's not uncommon for them to be followed, taken by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand up for your position (whether there are cultural differences or not, that's not right!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were Berber fishermen during the 10th century B.C. and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese under the name Casa Branca, but in 1755 it was abandoned after an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan under the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who established their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in all of Morocco to go shopping.
In the vicinity of the ancient Medina, there are many places where traditional Moroccan items are sold, such as clay pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trifles, although everything is prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist spot in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is fairly safe, any visit abroad should be considered in order to take note of the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its mountain gorilla sightseeing tours are among the cheapest in Africa.
To get to Goma, you can choose to take a mototaxi (wedding-wedding).
This, combined with the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given Tombuktu an image of an exotic and distant land.
Although Timbuktu is a poor city today, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, a product of the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the highlights of Henry Louis Gates's special Wonders of the African World on PBS.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (PNK) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which develops a different wildlife.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African nature reserves, there are daily fees for conservation and park access.
It may also be convenient to purchase a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after the homonymous island, which is the destination most tourists consider the main attraction.
The deployment of buildings that delimit the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a luminous bar graph evidenced by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbor.
The best way to enjoy the sights of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head for the Kowloon shore, located opposite.
It is in the reclaimed land of the northern coast of Hong Kong where its urban development is concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own, so if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, this is a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest chain of coastal mangroves, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans as a World Heritage Site.
Nevertheless, the forests are not just mangroves, but they have some of the last remaining trees of the towering jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans comprises an area of 3850 km2 and about one third of its extent is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those traveling east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 h.
Because buses between districts are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and comfortable way to get around to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, a Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m in width.
There is a 15 metre free space under the bridge and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The area that now constitutes the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in the region and lived as semi-nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chacaña region was home to other Aboriginal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered, and fished for a livelihood.
Paraguay, formerly known as The giant province of the Indies, was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the colonization stage, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its indigenous identity and idiosyncrasy.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and lower-level matches may also be played at other times of the year.
On the Argentine Polo Association website you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed at par with the British pound (GBP).
There's only one bank on the islands where you can change your money, it's across from the FIC West store in Stanley.
Pounds are usually accepted anywhere within the islands.In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the outlying islands, but you may be able to use British or American money.
It is virtually impossible to change money from the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, so make sure you do so before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30°C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive: While temperatures below freezing are very rare, wind and moisture interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific rainy or dry seasons; the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, so it should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, it should be kept at least 100 yards/metre away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/metre away from other wildlife.
No matter how meek they may appear, the truth is that bison, wapati, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they do not keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially wild; so respect their space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid or cook foods that release a lot of aroma and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the ships except one British cruiser, killing about 200 American and German individuals.
During the war for independence that faced the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, because Auckland has two ports.
In the North Harbour district on the Pacific Ocean, are the North Shore beaches, which stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are almost all sandy with safe swimming spots and mostly have pohutukawa trees that offer shade spots.
The port of Waitemataas is home to the Tamaki Drive beaches, in the extravagant neighbourhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the thing.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia might be considered better for transport.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
Australians consider the notion of flat white coffee foreign. A small black coffee is called espresso, cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not drunk with milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Numerous trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare there.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay particular attention to safety alerts.
The cubfish are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770, and occasionally outside this time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people, and most of them would be afraid of them and swim away.
The ocean is not the place where saltwater crocodiles actively reside.
Booking accommodation in advance gives you the peace of mind that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although other types of accommodation, such as camping areas, can also be booked through them.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even combined flights and accommodation packages.
They can also save the reservation for you in case you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly through the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees of musical events decide to camp out on the spot and most spectators consider it a crucial aspect of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, then you'll need to get to camp early to get a spot near the musical events.
It should be noted that while the musical performances may have ended, in other areas of the festival they could continue until late in the morning.
Some festivals have special camping areas, intended for family groups with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in wintertime, check where the cabin is, since crossing the ice creates a very annoying noise for those most affected.
During the cruises around St. Petersburg, time is also spent in the city.
Usually, casinos make great efforts to maximize the time and money their customers spend. There are usually no windows or clocks and exits can be difficult to find.
They often offer special food, drink and entertainment promotions to keep guests in good spirits and within the facility.
Some establishments serve free spirits, although drunkenness affects judgment and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or on mountain passes should anticipate the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On roads with ice or snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as you do on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, a large amount of snow can fall that will trap you in a very short time.
In addition, visibility may be reduced by snowfall or by condensation or ice forming in the car's windows.
On the other hand, in many countries the ice and snow conditions are normal and traffic flows almost without any interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable part for many visitors.
Popular usage of the term safari refers to land trips to see Africa's amazing wildlife, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are more likely to approach vehicles, and standard equipment will allow for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards may be shy at times, so you will have more opportunity to observe them using binoculars.
The excursion known as a walking safari (also called a bushwalk, hiking safari, or walking tour) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between 24 August and 5 September 2021. A number of events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Host of the 1964 sporting event, Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, complications may arise.
There are different types of travel cancellation policies, but since late March, coverage for much of these policies based on the coronavirus does not extend until July 2020, which is when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between JPY 2500 and JPY 130 000 and common tickets are expected to cost JPY 7000.
Ironing clothes while they are still wet can help to dry them out. Many hotels have ironing and a plank to lend to travelers, even if you are not in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not want to wear ironing stockings, you can try a hair dryer, if available.
Try not to let the fabric overheat, as it may shrink or, in extreme cases, burn.
Different methods are known for purifying water, some more effectively targeting specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, in others, several more are needed.
Not all filters are as effective, and if this concerns you, you should consider buying bottled water with a certified company's seal.
Travellers may encounter pests from animals not known in the regions from which they come.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in more serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, alone, or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill individuals by the use of their force, are not usually included in the pest category.
The duty-free purchase offers an opportunity to acquire, in certain places, duty-free and excise-free products.
Travellers visiting countries with a high tax burden can sometimes save a significant amount of money, particularly on goods such as spirits and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh freeway, the section between Point Marion and Fairmont is one of the most challenging driving conditions and often runs along secluded, lonely terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be on your guard: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes and closed corners.
The speed limits are notoriously lower than on the preceding and following sections, usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to them is even more important than on any other section.
Interestingly, though, cell phone signals are much better here than in many other sections of the highway like the Pennsylvania Wilds.

The stirrups are the footrests for riders that hang on either side of the saddle.
While they provide greater stability to the rider, they can present safety problems, as your feet may get stuck in them.
If a rider is dismissed from the horse but has one foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the animal runs away.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a straight and fairly narrow sole.
In addition, there are mountings, especially English ones, with safety bars that allow the leather of the stirrup to detach from its structure if a rider who is dismissed pulls back.

The idea of skiing is very old, as there are cave paintings depicting skiers and dating back to around 5000 BC.
As a sport, alpine skiing dates back to no later than the 17th century.
Skiing backpackers: also known as cross-country skiing, cross-country skiing or ski hiking.
Although they are linked, in general it does not involve practicing cross-country skiing or alpine-style mountaineering, developed on steep slopes and with much more rigid skis and footwear.
Imagine the ski run as a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, it will be able to cover somewhat longer distances than if it walked, but it will very rarely reach cross-country skiing speed without a good-weight backpack on conditioned slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to handle visa applications and passport checks several times.
However, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this respect.
Usually, whenever you move within this region, you will be able to cross the borders without going through a passport checkpoint again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you do not need to manage permits for each of the Schengen area's member countries separately, which will save you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion for determining when a manufactured good can be considered an antique.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit might be more narrow in places like North America than in Europe.
It may be that handicraft products are classified as antiques, even though they are newer than goods of similar characteristics produced in series.
Reindeer farming is a fundamental way of life among the Lapons and the culture related to this commercial activity is important for many engaged in other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Lapons have been engaged in reindeer breeding on a large scale, but have lived off fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using reindeer primarily as traction animals.
Today, many Lapps are employed in modern commercial activities.

When you return home from abroad, you will have adapted to that new culture and lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not foresee that tolerance and understanding are also necessary for returning travelers in their homes.

Finland is an excellent sailing destination: the 'land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't always need a yacht on the archipelago and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and the more tidal lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak provide a different experience.
Sailing is a national recreational activity in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but, apart from that, it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most exclusive cruises that are made across the Baltic Sea include a long-term stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.

The obvious way to travel first class or business class on an airplane is to spend a fortune on that privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for you).
But this comes at a price: generally speaking, you can pay up to four times the economy rate in business class and up to 11 times in class.
It's usually silly to look for discounts on first-class or business-class seats on direct flights.
The airlines are well aware that there is a basic group of travellers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to a place quickly and comfortably, and charging accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. Its regional language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely spoken.
