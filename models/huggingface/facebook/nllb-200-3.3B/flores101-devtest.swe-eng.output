Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely held, but it also provides details that fossils often cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the upper side, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a spool, but other features of feathers - rays and bi-rays - the researchers concluded that the spool was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or display. The researchers suggested that the specimen shows an adult plumage and not a chicken skin, even though the tail is from a young dinosaur.
The researchers reasoned that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not young feathers.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a crumpled sheet of paper with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the voter's identity has been verified by officials, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.
French electoral legislation codifies the procedure rather strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the start of the voting and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted from the voters in question.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process, and at night, the votes are counted by volunteers who are under extensive monitoring, and who follow specific procedures.

The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services cut the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to hospital at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with murdering his son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be rendered meaningless because her image has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law operates differently and courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University observes that ""journalists are taking a dangerous line when they publish images etc. of suspects""".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has told journalists that no further comment will be made before prosecution.
According to the leaked document, the leak is about the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on those before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reported are the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel is asking for ten years of constant military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while the PA only agrees to leave such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the supplementary pest control trial would be closely monitored by park rangers, observing the trial and evaluating its effectiveness.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and culture at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received extensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is the fifth interim election for Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the former provisional electoral council be dissolved, as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, some of them violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been postponed since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (Meti) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
"METI announced last week that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called ""indiscriminate""".
"The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The office of the Northern Mariana Rescue Service reports that there are no reports of any casualties in the country.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later switched places with an elderly lady because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as a doctor of obstetrics and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up the fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first boss, and she died on the night of the two moons, pretty unique just like her, a strong woman.'"
"Dustin 'Goldust'" Runnels said in a comment that ""Luna was as big a freak as I am... maybe even bigger... love her and will miss her... hopefully she'll be better off where she is now. """
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic had risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view that Queen Elizabeth II will be Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme end of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three Commonwealth Games relay races, but due to his ailments, there have been doubts about his fitness.
He has been unable to take the medication necessary to overcome his pain as it is forbidden in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date, on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery with various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of Earth's water resources, along with organic material, which could form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with the earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the earth formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
"He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and trash".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean the plane could fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at ground level.
The fear of a lack of transportation opened the possibility of the match having to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer due to cross-breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory Española darwin, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes.
It can be pulled into thin threads that can be twisted and braided, it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
"It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called 'upplysta manuscripts.'"
This is called the pH value of a chemical, and you can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry powders together, then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women stayed together.
When you're calling someone hundreds of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet [30 m] to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing that the wheel has brought is giving us much simpler and faster ways of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including loose pet taxons) that eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret behind their success is the concept of a niche, a special job for each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all felines, living in large groups called flocks.
Flocks consist of one to three related adult males along with as many as thirty females and young.
The females are often closely related to each other; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Leobots act much like wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
An all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is part of the same group (the Panthera family) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's loud roar, but more like a meaning of murmur, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals that they hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the ocelot follows and finds animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing out the ground where it has been.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and also move very sneakyly. Ocelotters hunt their prey by blending into their environment and then throwing themselves over the prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they often end up in a different environment from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so to be a strong competitor the new population needs different functions or adaptations than they needed before.
The native population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species, speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce food by using sunlight through photosynthesis.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, and much of the food we eat is plant. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain in its day, so it had nothing to fear except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were occupied by more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, meaning that there was no chance of escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a tongue that was split open, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked everything that came down into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasting species, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a hasselmus.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could lie on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no cocoa, no potatoes, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which was considered to be the god's home.
People brought offerings to the gods, and priests tried to appease the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests had access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziqqurat, were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open dishes facing the street.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland as punishment for murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Whatever his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
"Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland".
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even if there is something on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words 'Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776.' The text appears on the bottom of the document, up and down".
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we know that the large parchment (measuring two feet [75 cm] by two feet [62 cm]) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it's likely that the text was just written there as a label.
The landings on D-Day and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was run by the Vichy French, who were French people who had made a deal with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and turned on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also defines the size of society in some way.
Cities are the forerunners of nations, and civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge between generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked all power to impose taxes, and, with no national executive or judicial body, it fell to the State governments, often uncooperative, to carry out all its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to repeal tax laws and customs between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be added, and the states attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often counted as an archipelago in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiates a conversion of the original production of grain and hires Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, which gave Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the periphery of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration is still going on today.
For example, the most common format for stills in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its image ratio is inherited from the format of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to produce the simplest whole-digit relationship) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format) correspond to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The much abused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It is claimed that the best position for the subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds meet vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound European states together despite their differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of Christianity's main tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are for that very purpose.
The central power of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle had been fulfilled.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, Britain instituted a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off needed military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it dangerous even for neutral ships.
Since this tactic had limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolationism among most of the inhabitants and countries.
After witnessing the horrors of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to begin working for the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his former job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods of time; each stage in China's history, or each family in power, was a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of division between the provinces, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms, which occurred between the 60 years between the Han and Jind dynasties.
During these periods, violent warfare often took place between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, when thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all men seeking them, allowing the most ambitious and successful to steal success.
The same was true of the military, as ranks in the army were now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to make revolutions.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He often visited a cave that became known as ""Hira"" on ""Noor"" (light) mountain to meditate".
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on one of the mountaintops north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find even if you know it's there, because inside the cave, it's totally isolated.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid of Cheops is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or ""Giza Necropolis"" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tomb monuments, several temples, and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The 'up-stroke' marker looks like a V and the 'down-stroke' marker looks like a clasp or a square with no bottom".
Up means you should start at the tip and push the stalk upward, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand is holding the stalk) and pull the stalk downward.
An upstroke usually generates a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more resolved.
You may draw your own markings, but keep in mind that the printed line markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a group of market women on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
On one occasion, a mob member waved the head of an imperial guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of the conquest of the Philippines by American imperialism were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest of bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the great gains derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the temple lords, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period of time in which these events took place is often called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history from the 11th to the 14th centuries.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from the idea that technology drives development or the technological imperative to the strict view that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic that is connected to the laws of nature and how they are manifested in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects"" on societies that are primitive, rather than socially conditioned".
For example, one might say that the motor car inevitably leads to the building of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher rate of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of determinism, with origins in writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geographies shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography, and these, which harmonized with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
Its influence declined during the 14th century primarily because of the fact that Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices valued higher than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its zenith between the 12th and 14th centuries.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, because of the slow communication routes, the styles in the West were lagging by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the major developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to attach clothes.
Self-sufficient farming is farming that is carried out for the production of sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often ecological, system that uses saved seeds originating in the ecoregion combined with alternative crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers were self-sufficient, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, manner, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
"Such children are called 'wild.' Some wild children have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a child with severe intellectual or physical disabilities".
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild all on their own.
When the feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to that of the specific pet, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, tutoring goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support for individuals learning something new, for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but it is also the little gem-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software and is intended to question, guide and explain practices that may have been too challenging for the student to cope with on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring or educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our family home system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster homes are there to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home they came from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive character of the Internet leads to further dimensions in the theory of user experience.
"For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Both ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience responses on websites".
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial expressions that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can be identified as lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
"Oliver Sacks showed in his book 'The President's Speech' "how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage "can still judge sincerity correctly".
He even claims that we share such abilities in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination slides variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
On the savannah, a primate with a human-like digestive system finds it difficult to satisfy its need for amino acids from the plants available.
Moreover, lack of it has serious consequences; stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaf and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're properly prepared.
By comparison, animal foods ( ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also offer high-quality proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
"After all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their 'protein' problem in much the same way as chimpanzees do on the savannah today".
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and then falling back asleep shortly afterwards (1060 minutes).
This can be done simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you usually turn off your watch while you sleep, you can set it at the other end of the room so that you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which causes one to have to get up and pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates inversely with the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is present.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded with the path of love in Mahayana and many techniques in Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is the awakening of kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The God-Shyog is central to Tibetan meditation, where the visualization of different gods cleanses energy channels, activates chakras, and creates enlightened awareness.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, differences in systems, processes and culture led to the collapse of cooperation between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would go on for the next 40 years and would be fought physically by contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland and at the same time violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
By far the most efficient way of moving large quantities of people and goods across the seas is to use ships to transport goods.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to move troops and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes had them for milk, fur, meat and skin.
The domesticated sheep were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often herded by herders who were often children or youths, similar to the more famous sheep herder.
Chariot tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though wagonways consisted of only parallel wooden planks, the horses that pulled them allowed them to reach higher speeds and to carry greater loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
Sliders were introduced early to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a layer of iron on top.
This became the custom, but the iron tore more on the wagons' wooden wheels.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and the first all-iron cogs were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transportation was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) saw the light of day.
Their predecessor, australopithecus, was not used to walking upright.
Bipedal specialization has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases this is like symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been worsened by overpopulation and man's extravagant life-style.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
"Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 pages of the Dunlap Broadside that are known to exist today are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today, and we call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with fins and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits to use computer jargon.
Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to allow an immediate diagnosis.
The best sign of poisoning may be an open can of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term "bagger" is used in formal terms by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term comes from an ancient relationship with the wall-flying insects, which are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both beetles and louse are residents, adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their children, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to establish an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to find out how the world works by means of the scientific method, which in fact is the guiding principle of almost all research.
Experimenting, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely due to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not just responses to external periodic signals have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that repeats its cycle over a period of time even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to plant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They did two experiments that marked either the DNA of the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph and learn more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go to their jobs and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this massive colleculture has upset the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the behaviour of the industry cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
As well, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic tends to flow reasonably consistently and can be broadly represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between three main variables have been established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in the planning, design and operation of roadside establishments.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings along their bodies.
This gives them more small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the troll finches and the day finches.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, since the earth does not seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second longest river, with a flow more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, 9 kilometers wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the world's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main tributary, the Amazon, is 6,387 kilometers long, and it's fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and construction technique.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which at the time were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican City State is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City State are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical substances such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, when these can be discovered in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything was made up of one or more of four elements, earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had theories that they change into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals.
The elements calcium and potassium are considered metals, but there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a faithful companion for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have developed, the pencil has been downgraded in status and in use.
Today, people write messages on computer screens, and they never have to go near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to produce a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and then splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and it doesn't take much for them to break down.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the front side and 100 kilometers thick on the rear side.
It's thinner under the moonlight and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around figuring out what gets people going or what appeals to them.
Theories hold that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they want and what in their environment is making them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"In general, two behaviors may emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, the manager tries to remain 'one of the pack.'"
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you're transformed into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she has to change everything that the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams hold the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a contact point for the physical group.
They often have more say than conventional team members as different time zones can affect when their team can meet and this may not be understood by management locally.
"The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
"The 'invisible team' is the management team to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member".
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively in an organisation's functional departments, creativity and inventiveness can flourish.
Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a methodology used to support organisations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and therefore narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain diseases and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, diseases and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although strongly associated with science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that involves machine behavior, learning, and intelligence.
AI research is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and even handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now widely used in finance, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has been incorporated into several home computers and video game software applications.
Field studies are a big part of the teaching in every class, and often the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
Technology offers solutions with virtual study visits.Students can look at museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital; the website is updated each year, but previous versions may remain online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Students often begin their blogging experience with a poor grammar and spelling, and the presence of readers generally improves this.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
Blogging also 'forces students to become more aware of the world around them'.The requirement to cater for the interests of the readers stimulates students to be witty and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"The appropriate use of blogs ""can enable pupils to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online material, pupils can define their own positions in relation to what others have written, and articulate their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, and it offers a number of galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and in the north, the beautiful, unspoiled landscapes of the Muscocks.
All of this and more distinguishes Ontario as what outsiders consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas farther north are very sparsely populated, and some are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are part of France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the areas, which had a great impact in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope, thus finding the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is good to wear a ring too (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 11th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Meranids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find stalls selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of cream crunches, but all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the central parts.
Goma is relatively safe, but if you're visiting outside of Goma, you should check out the fighting in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest tracks of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote places".
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during the Henry Louis Gates PBS program Wonders of the African world.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities of the country, with an atmosphere that is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of some 7,500 square miles (19,500 sq km) and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which is home to a variety of wildlife.
It is one of the largest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been likened to a glittering stack diagram enhanced by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
The vast majority of the Hong Kong Island's settlements are clustered on the former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonists took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 50 miles [80 km] into Bangladesh and the Indian interior from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest that is on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remaining vestiges of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is wetlands.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 Axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the district's common bus station (above the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, run between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters, it is 1,900 feet [378 m] long and has two aisles that are 12 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are expected to be ready.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chacoregion was populated by other groups of native tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived as hunters, gatherers and fishermen.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the 'Giant Province of the Indies', was born as a result of the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and groups of the indigenous population".
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo courts in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets to polo matches, please contact Asociación Argentina de polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP) which is equal in value to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
GBP is generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and USD are often acceptable in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outlying islands, but British and American currency may be accepted; contact the owners in advance to determine what is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange your currency before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, temperatures over 30°C are common
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no special 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rain remains about the same throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wild animals!
However tame they may appear, buffalo, moose, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep adequate distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, bear in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a bitter stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the chief Tupua, Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because of Auckland's location between two harbours, there are many beaches, and the most popular are divided into three areas.
North Shore's beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and on most of them the Maori people offer shade.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-visited family beaches with a good range of shops located on the beach.
"The main local beer is 'Number One' which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines, but perhaps the New Zealand and Australian wines will be more suitable for the journey.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are worried.
"To Australians, the concept of flat white coffee is unknown. A "short black" is an "espresso", cappuccino has a lot of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are made to the reef year round, and damage from any of these causes on the reef is rare.
Still, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubmen occur near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The saltwater croc's main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they do not usually live in the sea.
Booking in advance gives the traveler security and assurance that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even flight-hotel combinations.
They can also reserve your booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests should go through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the overwhelming majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where things are happening, you'll have to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music performances on the main stage have stopped, parts of the festival may continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, because going through the ice causes really awful noise for those who are affected the most.
Cruise to Saint Petersburg includes time in the city, and cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually do everything they can to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and to keep them in the establishment.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know the importance of keeping sober.
Anyone driving on high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice and temperatures below freezing may occur.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you cannot drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time to cause you to get stuck.
The visibility may also be restricted by snowfall or snow drifts or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues to run almost continuously throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the largest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight of many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to trips across the country to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are better seen with binoculars.
"Walking safari (also called 'bush walk' and 'hiking safari') consists of hiking for either a few hours or for several days".
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, since it hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the launch was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies for the coronavirus look different, but by the end of March, most don't extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympics would have started.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a typical ticket price of around ¥7,000.
Knitting damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be borrowed, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not want to wear socks that are strung, you may want to try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the cloth get too hot (which may cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, to burn).
There are different sets of clean water, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are unsure, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travellers may encounter pests unfamiliar to them from their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst cases, allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with violence, are not usually classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods without paying taxes or other surcharges in certain places.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through isolated forested ridges.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, drive sensibly: steep inclines, narrow lanes and sharp curves are common.
The speed limits set are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections - usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and their compliance is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely, cell phone coverage is much better here than along many other routes, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, similar to those of its neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked in pastries all year round, and cherries and plums in the summer.
Many German pastries also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and popular cookies often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but powerful pastry, you can try the one that is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either ""dry"" or ""wet"" depending on the amount of liquid".
In the northern Indian and inland regions of Pakistan, yoghurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a catchall term that encompasses a wide variety of regional dishes scattered around the country.
However, when used without a proper noun, the term tends to refer to food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cooking, now available throughout the country, offers a range of simple spicy dishes, with the flavorings used by the Javanese most often being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The footrests are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may pose a safety risk as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but is stuck with one foot in the stirrup, he can be released if the horse runs away.
First, most riders wear heeled boots with a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that ensure that a saddle member will detach from the saddle if it is pulled backward by a rider who falls off.
The Cochamó Valley, Chile's premier climbing destination, is known as the Yosemite of South America, and it has a number of large granite cliffs and walls.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes through the endless mountain walls.
Cross-country skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport in which a person slides down a snow-covered landscape with skis or a snowboard strapped to his feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski lovers", who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular area.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Outdoor skiing has been a sport since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first Norse-owned ski club was opened in Australia.
Skiing: this activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski walking.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountain climbing, the latter being performed on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover a little more distance than walking  but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries.In normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would require you to pass visa applications and passport controls on several occasions.
The Schengen area, however, acts more or less like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport checks again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what makes a product an antique, and some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where age limits may be shorter in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass-produced goods.
Cleaning is an important source of income for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many other professions.
Historically, however, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived from fishing, hunting and the like and used the reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern industries, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
"Although frequently used, especially among non-Roma, the term 'gypsy' is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma people".
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel restriction, your travel medical insurance or cancellation protection may be affected.
You may also wish to consult other governments than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be in a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advice is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The picture presented is often rapid, general and oversimplified compared with the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different variations of them, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and wildfires are types and consequences of extreme weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hailstorms and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include heavy snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting their area, as it may affect itineraries.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
"A search on the Internet for 'hostile environmental training' will probably give the address of a local business".
A course usually covers all the issues mentioned here but in much more detail, usually with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts between 2-5 days and includes role-playing, much first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are plenty of books on how to survive in the wilderness, while books on war zones are rare.
Travellers planning to undergo a sex-rectification operation abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a gender (X) or documents that are updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
Foreign governments' willingness to accept these documents varies just as much.
Security searches have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Trans people who have not undergone surgery should not expect to pass through the x-rays with integrity and dignity.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that break off at the shore, often at a reef or similar.
The underwater topology causes the backflow to be concentrated to a few deeper parts, and strong currents leading to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after attempting to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, it's no more difficult than it normally is to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't get stuck again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, wait to be rescued.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (there is not as much of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to new cultures sometimes have a hard time adjusting back to their original culture.
On returning from living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country must adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors, and the story of sound and light is just like a fairy tale.
The background is the Sphinx, which tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries, and they have the most bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the community of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth's land is the region south of the peninsula, and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains fuse with the plateau and then recede to form the 360-mile-long Ellsworth Range, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with a peak of 4,892 m (15,580 ft) in Mount Vinson.
In remote places without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone does not generally replace a mobile phone, since you must be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used by vessels, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditionaries in need of remote data and voice communications.
Your local telecommunications operator should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
Travel and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
This is particularly popular with recent graduates, allowing them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a sabbatical abroad can actually increase your chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
Usually, a fee is charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a very boat-friendly country, and the land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands in the lakes and archipelagos.
In the archipelago and the lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While the archipelago and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any pleasure hunting, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seventh or eighth person.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specific Baltic cruises include a longer stop in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore on boat excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in their brochures, but as you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and aversions of other things that very many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight may help some to overcome a fear of discomfort or of being out of control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly, and often time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for smaller companies there was a problem.
If they've sent things by air freight, on some routes it may have taken days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it to you faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first- or business-class is to fork out a whole lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, let your company do it for you).
However, this does not come at a cheap price: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point even looking for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay well for the privilege of traveling anywhere quickly and comfortably, and they also charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is commonly spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failures of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Historically known as Smyrna, today it is a modern, developed city and a bustling commercial center situated on a huge harbor surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 17th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble statues of doves over part of the tombs.
It's worth a half hour's wandering around this captivating village.
Within reach to the north is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, made famous by a glimpse of its grandeur by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, visit the magnificent Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a site world-famous for Marian apparitions.
Remember that you are, in effect, visiting a mass grave site and a site of almost unfathomable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women still alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones murdered or worked to death here; Jews as well as non-Jews.
Please use this website with the great dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves, and do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by painting or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish, with about half preferring to speak Catalan, the overwhelming majority understanding it, and almost everyone speaking Spanish.
Most signs, however, are only in Catalan, which is by law the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also used in many public transportation and other institutions.
Regular messages in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disturbances are notified by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, impudent, and arrogant.
"Although this is often just a false stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave in the best way and behave like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-bred).
The cocky exterior of the Parisians will quickly fade if you show yourself from your polite side.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is thickly forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a strikingly high arthriticity, due to the extent of the microclimate, different soil types and varying elevation differences.
The area is also home to an extremely diverse array of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the badger, the wild cat, and the tiger are found there, along with many more common species
When visiting the monastery, women must wear a skirt that covers the knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries give scarves to women who have not prepared in advance, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
By the same logic, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the store in the lobby but the garments are not washed after each person so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan food, like that of similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional accessories available such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including Sie for the pronoun you, are capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
Some say it makes it easier to read, but the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is in the noun form makes the writing somewhat more complicated.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies based on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means wagon.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, you can benefit from reading this basic grammar book to learn much about Persian grammar and to understand sentences better.
Of course, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you already know a Romance language.
But people who know a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is sufficiently similar that it need not be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and are preserved as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in its heyday was not the kind of problem that it is today, it is usually found in cities or university campuses, more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or the viewing of cherry blossoms, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where they used plum blossoms.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to remove just one specimen.
"If you visit a landscaped garden, and you pick a 'specimen' it will also get you kicked out, without discussion".
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after arrival.
"But with its location in the ""high tropics"" just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often)".
There are also a small number of buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're thinking of taking goes to Hebron, not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good starting point for a holiday.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a boat trip to interesting towns on the Danube or a tour along the Erie Canal.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christendom, celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian lands and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold a Sunday night Easter mass on the Saturday night of the Easter holiday, and at midnight the congregation breaks up to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by either swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not take over, and so the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since man's arrival in the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic wintertime, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, since the sky is dark more or less 24 hours a day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is thus often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be accustomed to.
Costume is the normal business language, and colleagues address each other by last name or by job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, where the emphasis is on collective efforts rather than on individual achievements.
Often, employees must obtain the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without hesitation.
