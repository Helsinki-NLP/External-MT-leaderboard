Martelly was sworn in as a member of the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
The government had earlier proposed a presidential decree for the country ahead of new elections as part of the CEPA's reform package.
The rally was a response to the massive protests against the regime that had begun in Martelly's first village.
Occasionally violent protests have occurred, with some elections being held since 2011.

Gold can be cut into any shape by grinding, and it can be cut into any shape by grinding.
It can be pulled and made into a fine cloth, which can also be woven and embroidered. It can be knitted and made into a piece of cloth.
It can be made very thin, and crushed onto another metal.[citation needed] It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to polish hand-drawn figures called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make a marker using red water.
Sand water changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline it is chemically.
The pH level is expressed in terms of the amount of Hydrogen ions (H of pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons, from which electrons are cut (the sum of hydrogen atoms consists of a proton and an electron).

In ancient Egypt, Iran and China, the toilet sometimes included a section of the headrest open to the public for both men and women.
When you talk to someone who is thousands of miles away from you, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the search data in the sky and then sends it down almost at the same angle.
Scientists use the telescope in the sky because Earth's atmosphere is a fragment of light and distorts our vision.
To launch the telescope from space, a large rocket with a length of more than 100 feet is needed.
The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is that it has made transportation much easier and faster.

The piling bears, along with the leopard and jaguar, are in the same group (Genus Panthera).
The piling sound is not the same as the sound of a honeycomb, but rather the sound of a spoken goat.
Ocelots love to eat small insects, and will catch snails, walruses, cucumbers, and walruses if they can.
Scientists think that oselots can see food on the surface of the earth by sniffing their food.
They are very good at seeing at night in the dark, and are very dim. Ocelot fuse their neural glands to their surroundings to gain insight into the neural glands.
When a small group of Indians (a small number of inhabitants) are cut off from the core society from which they originate (e.g. when they cross a river or move to an island from which it is not easy to return), they will often find themselves in a different and alien environment, unlike the previous one.
This new environment has different color sources and competitions, which in turn attract new residents or new settlements, so that they can be more powerful in the competition.
The population of the resen has never changed, still hearing the old censuses.
Some say that as the new population begins to learn about its new condition, it will begin to appear as a smaller population than others.
It is possible that after thousands or perhaps millions of years the two populations would appear distinct, no longer being considered the same species.
We call this process, in the sense of the formation of a new species, diversity, an inevitable outcome of the whole and one of its most important parts.
Gea, which produces oxygen, which people breathe, and carbon dioxide, which they breathe (i.e. smell).
The bees produce their food from the sun by photosynthesizing it, and they also feed on it.

Mosasaurus was a fierce defender of its own nature, so it feared nothing but mosasaurs.
Their cheeks with 70 sharp, beard-like teeth, with an extra head on their mouths, meant that no escape was possible.
We do not know for sure, but he may have had a foreign language, including Kushan, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may have been a good-looking man.
He also attacked anything he could get into the water; a large dinosaur like T. rex would not be able to outrun him.
While most of their dishes are familiar to us, the true Romans included the cuckoo, the tavistock, the devil, and a variety of cockroaches called the bondage mouse, who also had strange and unusual feasting ingredients.
Another difference was that while poor men and women sat on chairs and ate, rich men liked to eat in the seating area next to them.
The cuisine of Ancient Rome did not include dishes that were introduced in the Americas and Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no ginger, no cloves, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Roman had ever made an oak.
The Babylonians built a temple to their god, known as the Temple of the Divine.
The people will be able to meet the needs of the gods according to the biennial and the rabbi with ceremonies and excesses

Thus, the sign may have been implemented as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France but the south was not yet free.
Vichy" was led by the French, who in 1940 had negotiated with the Germans and worked together rather than fighting the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was referred to as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and French forces liberated southern Free France and surrendered to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture that is shared by a community that is a large group of people who live and work together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis meaning citizenship, and civitas meaning city or city-state, which in turn defines the size of the community.
Before nations, there were city-states.Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge between several generations, a long process of cultural evolution and diffusion of knowledge.
Minor civilizations, sometimes, disappear without leaving any evidence of a connection to the past and are not recognized as desert civilizations.
At the time of the War of Independence, the first thirteen states had a central government under the Articles of Confederation, and there was only one Congress.
The Congress was not the sole authority for taxation and, as there was no national administration or court, it often relied on the incoherent state legislators to carry out all its actions.
Otherwise, it had no jurisdiction to issue a ruling against the laws of taxes and customs between states.
To effect the amendment, the constitution of all states was divided into units of states and the central government states were reduced to a few with few representatives.
The Italian national team is the second most successful team in the world after the German national team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Winter sports are most popular in the Nordic regions, with Italians competing in the indoor and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to Japanese groupings, Japan is often referred to in geography as the "Island Region".
Taiwan originates from the place where European navigators in the 15th century recorded the name of the island as Formosa Island or Delal Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company had established a settlement in southwestern Taiwan, started the conversion of coal products, and employed Chinese laborers in rice and sugar plantations.
In the 1683s, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) gained control of the western and northern shores of Tōyán, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonosaki Agreement, which would allow the island to remain under Taiwanese sovereignty until 1945.
Machu Picchu, is composed of three sacred buildings, the Intuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber/Chapel of the Three Chapels.
Many of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give the public a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, Machu Picchu was 100% restored and restoration continues today.
For example, the most widely used image-capture format in the world is 35mm, which was the primary size of film during the era of analog film recording.
It will be shot today, but more importantly, the surroundings of the picture were captured through the digital camera image format.
The 35mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm long, with a tapered blade.
It is also said that the ratio of width to length of this format (for the simplest exact number of parking spaces) is 3:2.
Several of the most commonly used formats (e.g. the APS family format) are similar or close to this latitude and longitude alignment.
The third, most frequently abused, method is a rule, which activates and at the same time establishes a standard according to the specification.
This shows that the most effective location for the subject is in the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines of the image are three pieces (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has been intertwined with the linguistic and cultural differences of European states.
Her power overcame everything, from the king to the people.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should be spent to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that money is specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the world has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and in one place the balance of power and money has thus raised the question of whether many people actually practice this belief.
After a moment of unease, the UK sailed around Germany.
It was a successful strategy that cut off critical military and civilian resources, while violating international law, which has been ratified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain, in order to prevent any ship from entering any part of the oceans, has placed explosives in international waters that have become a danger to neutral ships.
As the tactic was limited, Germany hoped to respond with a free-flowing submarine strike.
In the 1920s, the dominant attitude of most citizens and nationalities was pacifism and isolationism.

Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He made his name with four US cents, a book of poems, and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the inventor of his work before him) who is Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing the different lands; each dynasty or ruling house of China had a different house.
There was also an unknown age of subdivisions within each dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period within the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During this time, fierce fighting broke out among many landowners who wanted to get out on the text.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods of ancient China, with thousands of people killed in battle for the highest seat in the Xi'an dynasty.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the impracticality of republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state is not a ruler but a dictator.
Even after the revolution, the entire path of the scales was open to the gentle applicants, who could win the most observant and successful.
The same is true for the military in general, as the pay is no longer determined by class but by skill.
The French Revolution also inspired the Chinese and other rebellious groups caught up in the tyranny of other countries to start their own revolutions".
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond the worldly life. He often fell into a cave called "Hira" in the middle of the mountain "Nur", to meditate on these subjects.
He saw his own voice, he immersed himself in the cave, giving a very vivid picture of Muhammad's mental tendencies.
She wakes up on a mountain north of Mecca, cut off from the rest of the world.
There is one true genius, and it is not easy to discern him; once he is in the cave, he can escape completely.
Above nothing is visible except the many mountains surrounding the clear sky. Very little of this world can be seen and heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of seven pyramids still standing today.
The Great Pyramid of Giza built in the 3rd century BC in Egypt, is one of the largest pyramid buildings built in honor of the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Nebula contains several pyramids (the largest of the Great Pyramids), several smaller islands, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The unusual pyramid was built in honor of Khufu-Firewn, and many smaller pyramids, shrines and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family.

The upper beating is usually softer, while the lower beating is more powerful and more melodious.
Don't forget to do your own signs with the hammer, but remember that the printed sheep's signs are there for a musical reason, so often you have to protest.
King Louis XVI the Unknown, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister Madame Elizabeth were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a gang of market women on 6 October 1789.
In a fit of rage, they retreated to Paris, where they were met by a mob of people opposing the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of the carriage fully open.
In a shootout, a gang member shot dead a royal prosecutor in Versailles.
The war of the DY imperialist occupation of the Philippines was waged by Filipino people.
They were forced to pay the costs of the colonial regime in the United States, so that they could cover most of the costs themselves, and their interest flowed to the Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
However, the futile gains of the long-term frustration of the Filipino people have made the basic gains of the DY imperialism.
To understand the Perestinger, one must understand a connection to the making of the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, which is the period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (PM 1000-1300).
The High Stage was preceded by the Near Middle Stage, which was completed in 1500, followed by the Middle Stage of sound on the head of the unborn child.
Technological determinism is a concept that in practice encompasses ideas ranging from technological implementation, technological inevitability, and the inherent nature of the laws of science to their appearance in technology and their operation in a strictly logical to an absolute logic.
The conventions of technological determinism generally share two overarching ideas: the development of technology is largely driven by cultural and political influences, and technology has more "effects" on societies than social conditions.
For example, one might say that motorized tires have improved road safety.
Although a nationwide network of roads is not economically viable for these few small turtles, new ways of production are being explored to reduce the cost of turtle ownership.
The presence of mass transit vehicles on roads has also led to major accidents; this has led to the discovery of new techniques for mass transit services.
Romanticism was an element of cultural determinism borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the case of romanticism, geography has shaped people and within the world there have emerged customs and cultures on that geography that, given the location of society, are more consistent than the laws of the watchtower.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was accepted as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its heyday as a luxury resort began in the 400s and lasted until 1100s.
His status in the 12th century was on the decline, largely due to the cross-border trade in gifts such as cotton and spices, which were valued more than foreign markets.
It was at this time that the name of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, dress, in the east, was much under the influence of Byzantine culture.
Because of the slow channels of negotiation, the styles in the West were 25 to 30 years behind.
Europe began to adopt this style after the Middle Ages, and as a result of the Khmer Rouge invasion, one of the greatest advances of the time was the use of knives to shape clothing.
Debar agriculture, which is cultivated solely to meet the needs of the farmer and his family, is the product of a farmer.
Sustainable farming is a simple and often organic system, using either seedlings determined by seed rotation or other simple methods to achieve maximum randomisation.
On the dark side, many farmers struggle with agriculture, and this is still in the family in the developing societies.
Jêrkultur brings together like-minded individuals who feel isolated by societal norms and allows them to build an identity.
Subcultures can be discriminated against based on age, race, class, location and/or gender.
The ways in which a subculture is differentiated are linguistic, ethnic, religious, political, gender, geographic, or influential.
Members of a subculture often define their membership by fashion, behavior, and the use of symbolic and distinctive forms that are arguable.
One of the most commonly used methods to describe socialization is to investigate some of the most tragic cases of children who have been left out of the community due to neglect, neglect or knowing abuse.
Some children are placed in foster care by humans (usually their own family); in some cases this was because the parents did not accept the future of their child's brain and body.
Children who are abused or neglected before they are born or are abused.
Others are alleged to have been raised by grandparents; some are said to live in seclusion on their own.
When the puppy is fully raised by non-human intruders, he almost completely (within physical limits) displays behaviors similar to some intruders, such as his fear of humans and his disregard for them.
Learning about each project, making learning easier and more interesting, is a step further than scaffolding.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a tool that supports students who are entering a new stage of learning such as starting a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both fictional and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold; but in Microsoft Office the little man is also a clipboard.
The imaginary scaffolds are composed of writing, examination, and translation of the procedures that students have to undergo in the classroom.
Children are often placed in foster care for various reasons, including abuse, abuse, and even abuse.
You don't have to be a child to grow up in a nurturing, nurturing, uneducating environment, but they do.
We see the Protective Care System as a safe zone for these children.
Our patient care system must rely on safe housing, good care, balanced education and health care.
The nurses should provide you with all the necessities that were missing from the room you came from.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal.
Some features of the Internet, in terms of usability and near-completeness, reach difficult levels.
For example, "learning" and "learning" are defined as important factors for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal identity" and "persistent connections" as elements of new interest when reporting on online crowdfunding.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the dissemination of micro-defense, i.e. news reports that have been going on for several years.
In particular, it is claimed that, through the interpretation of the utterances of the mind, one can detect whether a moron is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks in his paper The President's Speech argued that people who have speech deficits due to cerebral palsy can still correctly view birth.
He even suggests that such deeply human-movement art is being shared by such giants as cat-dogs.
A twentieth-century study revealed that there are two genetic varieties of cockroaches: the hidden and the explicit.
Mutation induces a new genetic variant and selection kills it from the previously described variant.
In each generation there is a variation in the breeding variety between the two breeds.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its need for amino acids from existing plant sources.
Moreover, there are serious consequences of not doing so: growth failure, infertility and premature or delayed death.
The easiest to digest are the seeds, which will be in the leaves and stems, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are drunk.
In contrast, digestible foods (pumpkin, termite, eggs) by themselves cannot be easily digested, while all proteins with high amounts of amino acids contain amino acids.
When all is said and done, we should not be surprised how our ancestors solved their "protein queries" as chimps do today in the wild.
Sleep deprivation is the process of gradually awakening from normal sleep and returning to sleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
When an hour is slightly slower than the others, it is easy to do, you take a little bit of stress on your mind but it doesn't seem to be noticeable.
If you find yourself holding the clock at the moment of the break, turn the clock to the other side of the top/top and force yourself to go and stop it and escape from the worlds.
Other options on the biorhythm include the addition of a pre-resting silavyan (a drink of water or tea known as diuretics) when one wakes up for a light destava.
The amount of inner peace that one has with a person, contrary to the amount of soul and body distress, is one.
The present life force is positive, however small. Everyone has the potential for a moment of clear calm and contentment.
Everyone can reach the light. The only thing standing against us is our ignorance and our delusion.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddhist teachings, but has been expanded with various techniques such as the love path of mahayana and Hindu Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing path.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (light energy) is awakened through yoga pauses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of the meditative practice is Deity Yoga. Through the observation of various beings, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated and ronal awareness is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and was the cause of the USSR and the WEU's alliance.
After the end of the war, two years later, the old allies were no longer together and the Cold War began.
It would continue for the next 40 years, fighting on behalf of proxies from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939 the Polish leadership was in disarray and the only hope was for a withdrawal from the whole of the Romanian bloc and a renewed self-government.
However, these plans were virtually unworkable when, after overnight deployments of more than 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army violated the Riga Peace Accord, the Soviet-Polish Invasion, and after the eastern Polish territories were invaded and Ukrainian fronts were created, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and international agreements both failed and failed.
The use of cargo ships is by far the most efficient way to transport a large number of people and equipment within the oceans.
The work of the sea-going seamen has largely been to undermine the permanence of your art of transporting people and equipment, while also to interfere with your art of disregarding people and equipment.
One of the most notable examples of this end was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans sought to transport men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
The German naval force, which is mostly made up of U-boats, has also stopped the attack.
If the Allies were to fail, Germany would invade Great Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
The first bizines appear to have been made in the Zagros Mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and ethnicities have made themselves available for the easy delivery of milk, wool, meat and leather.
The shepherding business was mainly carried out by 'laborers in heavy or other areas of cultivation, mostly owned by children or teenagers known as shepherds.
Wagonways were developed in England in the early 16th century.
Even though several wagon tracks were made of only wooden beams, the horses were able to pull out at higher speeds and pull more weight compared to the worse ground tracks.
Crossties were introduced very early for parking in the parking lot, and it was thus understood that if there was a railway overpass in the upper level, the pieces would be more expensive.
This was a public act, but the railroad was increasingly the reason for the landing on the wagons.
Later, wooden railways were replaced by iron railways. In 1767, the first complete railways were put on the market.
The first known migration was evolution, with humans, two million years ago, beginning with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning the true human).
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, could not walk alone.
Two-legged features have been found in the remains of Ausralopithecus between 4.2-3.9 million years ago, however Sahelantrhopus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start a green life, we can join environmental organizations and we can become activists to reduce the impact of climate change in a given context.
This is in many cases equivalent to symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution we should find the clogs and cut them off from our ears and ears.
It is clear that the world has changed dramatically with technological and scientific advances, with a large population and an unprecedented humanity.
After it was passed by congress on 4 July, a draft was signed by congressional premier John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson and sent to John Dunlap's printing press containing several blocks of it.

Some have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior is largely dependent on the presence of internal cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Temporary veins, which include not only response to temporary external signals, but also bacterial, fungal, grain and algae, have been documented for most species.
Biological clocks are oscillators that, in the absence of external servers, continue their water cycle and function with a constant frequency.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a virus to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments, each showing either DNA in phase with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in phase with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material involved and the absence of hot cell networks can have many different mutational effects.
Only mutations in the cell line can be passed on to children, but mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism attracts people who visit natural areas, who want to take a break in the wilderness, in the midst of the deep life of trees and trees.

Why do replacement systems put curves on such scales, why do they always fail? Are replacement engineers useless? Or is there something fundamental underneath?
Flow is a work on the movement of different objects and objects within two worlds and their interaction with each other.
It is difficult to study traffic flow because one cannot say the behavior of drivers 100% correctly.
It is good to have a direction of motion in a reasonable medium; thus, the direction of flow back and forth has its own reasonable stability and velocity is represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow back and forth, interactions were made within three chemical properties: (1) flow, (2) flow rate, and (3) velocity.
These connections help to scale, design and manage the regular buildings.

Chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to man since ancient times, as they can all be found in their original state and their extraction by non-ferrous tools is relatively easy.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything consists of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma; however, according to his theory, these can be replaced by the new matter we see.

This behavior often causes doubts among the leaders and the rest of the collective.
Online teams share the same standards of perfection as traditional teams, but there are minor differences.
Members of fictional teams often serve as a point of connection for nearby physical groups.
Because their teams can be assembled in an unintelligible manner despite different hours of operation by local authorities, they are often more self-contained than members of the 'ad hoc' group.
The existence of a bear "fantastic team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109), is also an unusual piece of a fictional team.
The secretariat is the executive committee, which reports to each member.
Why would an organization want to engage in the trivial process of building a demanding organization?
When all available resources are effectively used across the active parts of an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative process of working with a particular organization's challenges can lead to a new process that creates a service that meets customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must build a culture of innovation and implement shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), describes continuity as a method by which companies can achieve a high level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical view of the study of communication, and therefore the field of study is narrow and very open.
The relationship between neurology and behavior supports scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumor can affect human behavior and cause altered mental focus.
The rise of new technologies is bringing us to the brain structures and processes we never saw before.
This provides a wealth of knowledge or material for performing simulation models that we can use to study our mental processes.
While artificial intelligence (AI) often refers to imaginative science, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the movement, learning, and manipulation of machines.
His research in AI includes automating tasks with the help of automated machine-driven movements.
The samples include checking, calibration, land accounting, identification of customers and answering their questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face identification.

Field trips are a big part of every classroom, and often a teacher wants to give his students a place where there is no option to take a bus.
The technology offers solutions through intensive field trips, where students can sit in their classrooms and visit museums, visit an aquarium, or watch fine art.
The event is a way to spread the word about the tour and experiences with the next class.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, the website is redesigned every year, but the old version for the album is registered online.
Blogs can help students develop writing.While students often start their blogging experiences with rules and unconventional writing, having a group can change this dramatically.
Since readers are often the most critical audience, the blog author struggles to stay ahead of the criticism.
Blogging also "ensures students learn more about the world around them". The need to draw public attention, encourages students to be alert and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration among students and gives them the courage to continue the learning process after the day's training.
In particular, the use of blogs may "encourage readers to be more analytical and critical; through active response to online material, students can position themselves on other people's writings and comment on their own in the most sensitive contexts (Oravec, 2002).
