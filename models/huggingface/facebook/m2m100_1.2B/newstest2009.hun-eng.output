The Prague Stock Exchange went down at the end of the trade
The Prague stock exchange corrected its losses after the early morning crash.
Transactions with the shares of the Czech Energy Enterprise (ČEZ) accounted for almost half of the usual daily trading.
The Prague stock market continued its fall on Monday after the start of trading on Tuesday, when it fell by six percent.
This time, the fall of Wall Street stocks is behind the fall.
This is also reflected in the market reaction to the result of a vote by the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to support the financial sector’s stabilization plan.
Shares in Asia
Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, although the indicators eventually canceled some of the losses during the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng stock index dropped four percent during trading, but later canceled some of the losses and reduced the drop to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while the markets in Shanghai closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange fell 3.6 percent according to the Taiwan Stock Exchange Index.
“The timing of the U.S. rescue operation is uncertain and will affect the global financial markets,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it determines its monetary policy independently of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said U.S. lawmakers should immediately resume negotiations and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Other countries are threatened to suffer the consequences.
The Bloodshed of American Shares
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a bill to support the financial system, which would have cost $700 billion (nearly $12 trillion).
Thus, lawmakers ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
Bush said the bill would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloodshed and leading stock indices recorded the biggest drop in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell 7 percent, the last time it experienced a similar drop was in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal was not accepted in the House of Representatives, the index began to drop.
Congress Resigns: U.S. Government Could Pump $700 Billion into Banks
The top leaders of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on the broader form of the agreement and on financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
This will be voted at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in negotiations to approve a bailout plan in the form of a $700 billion ($12 trillion) financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
There is no victory yet.
Congress must complete some details of the agreement before it can publish the final form of the law and its vote.
The draft budget will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was announced by Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee on Financial Organizations.
Senate sources say they are likely to vote on the bill as early as Wednesday.
Economists say there should be an announcement of the approval of the bailout plan, which is the first important psychological factor in the recovery of the financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, there is a "outbreak" thereafter.
The plan must be effective.
“We have taken a big step.
We have resolved our divergent views on what the package should be like to stabilize the market," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
The final vote may take place on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Saturday night to give a final form to the government fund.
This would involve the purchase of non-selling mortgage assets from financial companies, which would cause financial firms to suffer severe losses and jeopardize the stability of the entire system.
“We are close to a final agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
The repair plan still needs to continue, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Signal to Asian Trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, said lawmakers are seeking a deal in Congress on Sunday.
This is intended to reassure investors before trading begins in Asian financial markets, where the time zone could be the first to influence Monday’s Congressional decision.
It is unclear when the two houses of the U.S. Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether the trial will be stopped at the last minute due to a problem.
Legislators hope that the law will be passed in the coming days.
However, the law is undergoing a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts.
According to President George W. Bush, the first $350 billion should be made available as soon as possible.
However, Congress may block the issue of the remaining amount, which was set to be another $100 billion and subsequently $350 billion, if it feels that the program is not performing its function.
Bush assesses progress in negotiations
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may override its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained, which was the acquisition of assets for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that lost their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay off their mortgages.
“We have prepared everything.
The law should be able to be voted by the House of Representatives on Sunday and by the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President Bush is pleased with the progress made.
Bush spokesman Tony Fratto said the president was pleased with Saturday’s progress and appreciated “the bilateral efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of end-of-life compensation
Christopher Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who led the negotiations, said lawmakers had agreed on the responsibility for the financial program, on protecting taxpayers from losses, on closing the discounts, and on timing the funding draft.
The new law also limits the so-called bounty compensation of directors participating in the program and establishes a supervisory committee for the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and have made great progress towards a deal that will work and benefit all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts on helping homeowners who have trouble with repayment.
The government should negotiate new payments for the mortgages it purchases, with the aim of reducing the monthly payments of debtors and enabling them to keep their homes.
Spiritual aid
According to David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"All this is because it is not possible to know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will determine how the financial sector and government will distribute the losses,” Marek told the iHNed.cz website this week.
Marek said it is not so important whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week.
“More importantly, Congress will decide this week whether they will support the plan and give their blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual importance of agreeing that the plan will be approved is the most important thing at this moment," Marek said.
MP3 players versus mobile phones.
We help you choose
While almost all mobile phones can play MP3 files, you can’t make phone calls with any MP3 player.
It seems clear that it is better to just buy a phone.
There are many reasons why you should buy an MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the future owner.
You will probably find it difficult to get a high-quality, expensive record player for your home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulence record.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on bakelite discs, but there is no objective reason for this in terms of quality.
However, if your shelves are filled with art rock, jazz or blues bakelets, you’re probably dreaming of such a record player.
This is similar to travel, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
It may be unacceptable for some to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan will probably find it difficult to accept a 20 crowns market earphone.
There are two extremes between which everyone has enough space.
The choice is wide.
The lifetime of the elements also matters.
Some top-notch music players can do much more than just playing music, but also what most mobile phones don’t even happen to.
No device is as universal as a phone.
In addition to the primary features, calling and texting, you can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera in it, and even navigate.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a little wonder, as no refrigerator can grill and no TV can take pictures.
Many mobile phones also have disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more times the display will send it to the charger.
Music is one of the greatest energy sources.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, mostly much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobile phones, therefore, expect that they will not play for you for more than a few hours.
If you’re still calling here and there, bring an additional charger to your workplace for safety reasons – this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have such a problem, even the worst will withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one charge.
The next problem arises when uploading music to your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without specialized software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but few card readers can cope with miniature memory cards used in mobile phones without an adapter.
With a few exceptions (iPod) players do not need any special software.
It is enough to charge the device from the computer with music via USB.
Most mobile phones and players already create a music library ordered based on the artist, the album, the genre name, or, for example, the user's evaluation.
Some devices only display a wooden structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with an operating system).
Players are easier to manage, mobile phones know more
When choosing a particular device, you should first consider the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output, and, of course, the convenience of handling.
If your music is primarily used as a background and you only listen to it for a short period of time every day, for example on the radio, any MP3 player is suitable for you.
Any mobile phone can do this.
You do not even have to pay special attention to what music formats your mobile or player can.
With MP3, everyone will cope, and the vast majority of the music that reaches you will be in this format.
MP3 is one of the most widely used formats, and the vast majority of devices also handle WMA music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) is less common.
Better mobile phones also allow for online music purchases, for example.
It is enough to visit the relevant pages of the provider (or other provider) via the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service itself can be a strong argument for purchasing mobile music.
Unfortunately, the offer of providers is vague and is generally limited to one-year radio loads only.
Prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, the Internet or the wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their cell phones with them all the time.
Whenever he wants to listen to something, he holds his cell phone in his pocket while the forgotten MP3 player lies at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry your earphones or at least your loudspeakers.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost every mobile, but only a few MP3 players have.
For many, the biggest advantage of mobile phones will probably be the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand kroner.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can already get a pretty decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you are limited by the lack of a traditional earphone output.
The best and most technically equipped phones can cost up to fifteen thousand crowns with conventional 3.5mm hole earphones.
The main advantage of these devices is, among other things, the ease of handling.
The easiest - not necessarily the cheapest players (see our selection) are really everybody can cope with.
Minimum functionality, comparable to previously conventional cassette magneto or gramofon handling is obvious.
There is no threat of collapse in the form of accidentally connected mobile internet, nor in the case of the subsequent huge bill for data transmission.
What Equipment to Choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
You can also purchase the right card for a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
Basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive can start with up to 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and even want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not need to spend more than 1,100 SEK.
If you belong to the more demanding students, prefer to choose specialized mobile walkers (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, which makes it convenient to access your MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson is the leader in the industry, with its Walkman series phones having the same user interface as MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the above-mentioned brands can offer the same service in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The Czech mobile market is relatively developed and our providers offer practically the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, something is missing here for us - a virtual provider that forces classic providers to significantly reduce prices.
Maybe it won’t be that long anymore.
On the Mobil.cz website we have written many times that the Czech providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the ČTÚ, which pointed to the fact that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in other EU countries.
Following the recent step of the European Commission to regulate roaming charges, this may lead to a controversial situation - SMS sent from abroad to some customers of Czech mobile operators will be cheaper than domestic ones.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple: there is no real competition.
This may sound controversial as we also have three mobile networks and our penetration is high above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are pleased to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority, has repeatedly stated that there is no place for a new provider in the Czech Republic.
Per it’s true that a classic provider with its own network probably won’t have a lot of chances (although it would probably be difficult to find a frequency).
But there is another option - the virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market that brought a significant price drop, to which classical providers had to react.
In the meantime, even before the big fish markets, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in the UK, heard sounds similar to ours.
However, it has been proven that such providers have a place and can really be successful.
However, we do not need to go too far for an example.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
This service provider managed to gain more than 100,000 customers in just six months and became the fifth largest provider there.
In the meantime, behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is the ability to focus on a much smaller target group.
In order to operate efficiently, it requires far fewer customers than a traditional provider.
It does not involve relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual providers in the world thus tend to appear as low-cost – they offer cheap calls and text messages, which, however, are often offset by fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers at least 50 percent cheaper text messages than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good move to bet on a target group.
This service is specifically aimed at men.
“Real men choose Mobilking – who they like, who they can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual provider.
It’s hard to say if a similar idea can also work in Poland.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone spokesman, doubts about this: “The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory in terms of service offerings.”
In the Czech Republic, mobile operators claim to be unlikely
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about a successful expansion of this project, but the talks in the Czech Republic do not seem to be too hopeful.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region,” said Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for Penta Financial Group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It indirectly demonstrated that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not excessively sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do their utmost to prevent any potential competition.
The GTS Novera Group has not hidden its interest in the launch of the virtual service provider for a while, which thus aims to take another step in making Telefonica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in offering our customers not only wireless, but also mobile telecommunications services.
The sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile providers.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, the group’s spokesman.
Maybe better times are coming.
From unofficial information, it seems that we may be lucky with the first virtual provider by the end of the year.
However, his birth is surrounded by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At this point, we do not think that a full-value virtual provider would have a place in the Czech market.
The Czech market is very special, unlike other markets.
Until now, we have not been called by a single entity offering a complex and serious project in this area,” said Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefónica 02.
Other service providers also refer to the special situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, T-Mobile spokeswoman, exceptionally agrees with O2 and adds: “So far we have not recorded any viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects that could be further based on.”
And he added: “It is unlikely that any virtual provider will appear on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, there should be a concrete agreement on our table so that we can think in such a short term."
Vodafone is focusing on fulfilling its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, primarily in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider to be the most profitable for customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find partners to build shared networks for high-speed mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - in line with service providers
The behavior of mobile operators is easily understood, the entry of another operator would increase competition, lead to price decreases and thus their profits decrease.
So why facilitate entering such a competition?
When the service providers are able to collaborate on something important, there is also a whirlwind around the birth of U:fon.
The biggest pressure on ČTÚ was probably around the birth of T-Mobile’s U:phone.
This is evidenced by the publicly available information on the website.
But now it is U:fon that comes as a good argument for why we do not allow the entrance of the virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová added: “The competitive environment in the mobile market has recently been affected by the fourth mobile operator’s access to the market.
Given the nature of the Czech mobile market, it is clear that the entry of a new player into the market and its services would pose high demands.”
However, given this attitude of mobile operators, the Czech regulatory authorities are completely uninterested.
Meanwhile, it is not just about the ČTÚ’s attitude, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic – unlike the UK and other developed countries – has no right to interfere in economic competition.
Only the competition authority has the right to do so.
But the office is characteristic of the whole problem.
“The entry of a virtual provider into the mobile market would only be possible after a contract between the mobile provider and the virtual provider for the rental of the necessary infrastructure was concluded.
So far, no such agreement has been concluded, as the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting to traditional providers,” said Kristián Chlapua, of the Department of External Relations of the Competition Office.
A statement from representatives of service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the agency, which should represent the interests of consumers and ensure that no one abuses its market position, this is more than strange.
Especially, if Kristián Chalupa adds, "In foreign countries, where virtual providers generally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the decline in the price of mobile phone services."
However, it is likely that the UOHS is not in the interests of pressure to ensure the proper functioning of the market environment and to lower prices.
In this case, it is really shocking to see the reaction of the three mobile providers.
The question of whether this is just a coincidence is obvious.
As with gas stations, the exact same gasoline prices are just the work of chance and fierce competition.
“The Office has not detected any signs of anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the providers have a leading position, i.e. they have no proportionate responsibility for their market activities.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual providers are likely to be lacking in the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said.
The presentation of the market leadership position is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, based on which telecommunications is the only market in terms of economic competition.
After that, of course, there is no Czech service provider in a leading position.
However, some legal experts also offer a different approach - the establishment of a virtual provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - relatively logically - has a monopoly on its own network.
So in a certain segment it is necessarily dominant.
But even if this argument is not accepted, it should be a minimum warning for ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting remarkably similarly.
Meanwhile, complaints from a number of stakeholders (including the already mentioned GTS Novera company) show that they face very similar obstacles in negotiating with all providers.
The imposition of responsibility on ČTÚ is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which the ÚOHS takes its hands off the whole case.
We have already encountered it in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, the extension of the ČTÚ’s powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications was not implemented, although many experts hoped that this would improve the situation.
This should be well understood by the representatives of the UOHS, but they probably have other interests.
It works when no one is watching.
Meanwhile, the operation of some kind of fake virtual service providers remains unnoticed, many of which are already operating on Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile phone services, which, however, are only partially public.
It is a multilevel marketing company.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Pricing lists of these companies usually only reach the selected ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts against the provider as a classic corporate customer ordering large amounts of SIM cards.
As a preferred customer, you will receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial terms of all Czech mobile providers prohibit similar pre-sales.
"If there were cases you are talking about, it could be a breach of contract terms that we would deal with and that could lead to the termination of our cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this issue.
But it is unlikely that the news of such activity would not have reached the responsible people of the mobile providers.
These three companies have thousands of customers.
At the same time, no provider protects against such a procedure.
In fact, these companies have no negligible profits from their activities and at the same time, unlike real virtual providers, they are not threatened with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not on their name, so they can’t have it as fully as general customers of mobile operators.”
At least that’s what I should be curious about.
In addition, another question arises for the OOHS.
If mobile operators shut their eyes on a similar procedure, why are they preventing the birth of a virtual provider?
It should be added that the UOHS has a relatively strong authority to disclose such activity, and if it does not wish, it does not have to be content with explaining to the providers that they did not suspect such a thing and that their commercial terms prohibit it.
When you are the most expensive
As has already been mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market has resulted in a noticeable decline in the price of services.
Meanwhile, in virtually every country where virtual providers have been established, traditional providers have tried to prevent their establishment more or less.
The arguments they used were virtually the same - too small, possibly too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was at these moments that regulatory authorities intervened, which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Then, either through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual provider, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies give the whole matter to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competencies are good for them in these cases.
But don’t give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual provider with us really appears soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one provider would allow the establishment of a virtual mobile provider, it would be difficult for the ÚOHS to remain indifferent to rejecting (discriminating) further interested parties.
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may no longer be going to call more expensive.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four edits of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On the National Day of the Czech Republic, Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek presented the new recordings of the national anthem of the Czech Republic.
The anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solos, with a singing arm or instrumentally.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The authors of the modification of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the website you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He told the Czech Radio earlier that he has deliberately chosen young singers with representative voices that are expressive and popular to sing the vocal variations.
“From the very beginning, I have been working with both of them, and later with the band, to ensure clear diction, clear text and consistency,” he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song “Where is my homeland?” was first performed in the Rendi Theater in 1834 in Josef Kajetán’s play “Tyl Fidlovačka”, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously regarded it as their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
Even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state symbols.
The “New” Hymn
The Prague transport company will deliver with a chip card for the first time on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the Prague Transportation Company entered its history as the first passenger to board metro, trams and buses with an electronic voucher in their pocket instead of a paper line ticket.
Currently, the coupon is available to approximately 100,000 people who have an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (valid from 1 January 2009) and save it on their chip cards at the Transportation Company’s information centers and offices at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons can be purchased online from yesterday via the Transportation Company’s website www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers in the afternoon.
Those who are beginning to use online trading may forever forget about the subway stations where they had to go through long rows for line tickets.
The voucher can be purchased via the Internet and saved on an Opencard card in one of the thirteen accounts of the City Library.
“In these locations, passengers have a desk with trained servers to help those interested in online shopping and save their purchased coupons on their cards,” said Martin Opatrný, a spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons can also be saved to OpenCard in the self-service machines installed in some halls.
How do these machines look?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket managers and passengers may have already noticed them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Budějovická, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eight," Opatrný added.
Controls the driver instead of the driver.
Managing machines that start operating tomorrow is easy.
Just insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid voucher will be saved on its own.
Electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings from tomorrow.
So by trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499 which are used primarily by residents of the Central Czech routes to travel to the capital.
“On the integrated transport trains in Prague, guides were equipped with card readers, which can also be used to determine the validity of the coupons in the zone,” explained Filip Drápal from Ropid, the organization that compiles the schedule of public transport in Prague.
In buses around the city, card readers are integrated with the driver at the box office.
At boarding, the driver must not only show the chip card, but also place the Opencard in a specified place on the side of the box.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"If a passenger, for example, needs to check the validity of coupons, the easiest way is to ask the driver to do so," he added with Drápal.
Passengers who travel in non-city buses and will not remember when their coupon expires can go back to self-service machines that save their coupons to cards.
Information about the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the equipment.
Sudans want U.S. referendum
In 1945, the Sudet Germans demanded the annexation of Šumava to the United States.
This is revealed in the letter, which is in the collection of the Scientific Library of the South of the Czech Republic.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
This was supposedly the request of a group of Sudanese Germans to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also revealed in a surviving letter from a private archive, which is now stored in the collection of the Scientific Library in the South of the Czech Republic.
The Germans of Česky Krumlov in the letter ask the U.S. President not to allow the return of the "Shumava County" to the Czech Republic, which was still occupied by Hitler under the Munich Treaty.
"We have interpreted the situation correctly and we really want to be sure in the words that American troops will come to German territories in no way as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it is written in the letter, signing with the words "People who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts."
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia is supposed to give the Sudet Germans - in addition to the knowledge of the Czech national character - only hope for brutality, relentlessness, non-understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the US president to take over Šumava's protectorate "now and forever".
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million people, this territory would be judged to us as a foreign country that oppresses and exaggerates the minority, and would contribute almost nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors were unable to sign was allegedly the fear of the revenge of the “Czech oppressors.”
So if the president of the United States allegedly doubts the opinion of the Germans in Shumava, it would be enough to hold a referendum in Shumava County on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the United States and want to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem a little naive in addition to the current knowledge of post-war history, some historians say it adequately depicts the expectations of the Sudet Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had a minimum guess that they would be deported from the country, only a few of them acknowledged this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to agree on some sort of autonomy for the Sudans.
Others were hoping to stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in České Budějovic.
Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German in Budějovice during the war.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and thrown into the Holštynsk prison camp, dozens of other Czech Germans came to teach them Czech.
“They were confident that when they returned home, they would enjoy the Czech language,” Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be expelled from the country on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don’t think – you pay.
Emotional campaigns attack leaders
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
This is also the case with the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport plans to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček from this campaign hopes to deter leaders from dangerous behavior behind the government.
The 150-million-dollar campaign will be featured on television, radio, movies, the internet, but will also appear on brochures.
Drivers should be warned of speeding and alcohol.
And you should also remind them to put their seat belts on before they leave.
It is aimed primarily at the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, not least, professional drivers.
What appears in the advertisements?
Emotional attacks are primarily human stories.
This is evidenced by the slogan of the entire campaign:
You don’t think – you pay.
The phrase "do not think" is written in large letters on the registration number.
And in the blood vessel there is the word “pay”.
This should symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of inattention with his life.
Advertising spots will scare viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where dramatic images of victims of accidents are regularly viewed.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising spots were produced by the Euro RSCG agency.
Leave it to the drivers.
Drivers are subject to the ‘drain, drop’ system.
For them, the ‘cut it off’ is when they cross the red, for example, saving time.
The ‘drain’ is the danger of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why there is a need for an information campaign in the press, primarily a negative campaign, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the drivers' attention to the danger signs are less effective.
"If the danger warning sign is installed, it will probably quickly fuse with the environment and drivers will not deal with it," Kořán warned.
Olmert wants to return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmer, the president of the Israeli interim government, talked about returning virtually all of the territories occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview published by Jedi Achronot Daily on Monday.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we have to return almost all, if not all, of the territory,” Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we must give the Palestinians a similar percentage of Israeli territory, because without it there will be no peace," he said.
He acknowledged that the possible return would include East Jerusalem.
“Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, that tractors and bulldozers don’t go through his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, must give up a portion of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to the attacks on two cities in July, in which a few people were killed and dozens were wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a “special solution for the Temple Mount, holy and historical sites” in the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he stressed.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also stated that the withdrawal of Israelis from the Golan Heights is a prerequisite for a peace deal with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose a peace with Syria based solely on the withdrawal from the Golan," he said.
“The Syrians know what they have to give up to get the Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they must give up their systematic support for terrorism in Iraq by Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (the Holy War).
Questions after an accident: Are passengers in buses illegal?
The law does not recognize them, they are not allowed to walk in long-distance buses
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near Padova, Italy, the question arose whether accompanying passengers and passengers are allowed to travel in the bus while traveling.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activities of the passenger escort will be contrary to the Law on Transport Activity," said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The death of a 22-year-old passenger last week was probably caused by a truck driver crossing the bus route.
To her unhappiness, she was sitting next to the driver at the moment, in the least safe seat in the bus, even though there were two more seats reserved for her.
The bus may collide or brake suddenly even when the passenger serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
It is important to know if the bus has a parking space according to the traffic permit.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses have no parking spaces; which has been confirmed to Aktuálně.cz by Radim Jančura, the company’s director.
"We tried to find a solution with this ministry and initially passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this was withdrawn, and we have come to the conclusion that passengers can go to the toilet while on the way, provided they have their own seats," he said.
The law does not recognize the passenger.
"There is no clear legal regulation on the role of a passenger escort - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing the services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a vehicle accompanyer; it does not define his rights and duties," adds less clearly spokeswoman Hanzelka.
Josef Pokorný, director of the Department of Road Vehicle Operations of the Ministry of Transport, on the contrary, believes that the law addresses the problem properly.
"It depends on whether there is a parking spot on the bus traffic permit.
And that ends,” he says.
By their distinction, buses can be urban, where there are stops and the maximum speed is limited, as well as with inter-city stops and permitted higher speeds, and long-distance buses with no stops and maximum permitted speed, seats with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
Jaroslav Hořín, a traffic safety expert at BESIP, sees no fundamental problem in the movement of passengers on board the bus.
"There are not many dangers in the course of continuous progress, the situation can be compared to service on the plane.
It’s not sure when there’s turbulence and the crew can beat your head.”
“But if the bus brakes suddenly, of course, its physical laws apply.
Same as in city buses or trams.
The safety of the passengers must be solved by the carrier through internal rules," he says and also believes that the problem is not solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to shut down services
Student Agency offers passenger escort services as the only bus carrier.
It employs 200 passengers.
The manager does not consider their job to be risky after the accident.
“But as soon as I get the impression that the occupation of passenger escorts is risky, I will quit.
Coffee and newspapers are available at boarding.
It would also be a cost savings,” he says.
In his vehicles, the lack of passenger escorts was justified by safety concerns by Alexej Litvin, the director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of flights compared to the Student Agency.
“We don’t have passengers, we’ve been against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some sort of fatal injury," he told Týden.cz just a year ago.
An incredible tragedy
A young passenger from Plzeň, who worked for the company for two years, died during a scheduled flight in Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned out of the stop lane without using a direction signal and stopped the bus.
The driver of the bus attempted to escape, but the right front of the bus struck him.
That two reserved seats for the rest of the passengers were also sold, Jančura rejects.
"These seats cannot be booked on long-haul flights, they are blocked."
The company wants to prosecute the truck driver.
By compensating the girl’s family, the agency does not wait for the court’s judgment, but also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Amendment of law?
In the distant future
To clarify the movement of passengers on board the bus could mean the law amendment, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year.
However, the group has not achieved any concrete results.
The buses are not so much, but rather the point system deals with the maximum allowed speed on the highway and mobile use while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of passenger escorts to be something that would fundamentally threaten the safety of passengers," said Hanzelka, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Transport, concluding that the control of the safety of buses is the responsibility of the police and labor authorities.
Dusseldorf hopes for Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB Board of Directors to the staff of the bank does not shrink in the big words.
The merger of the divisions of the Düsseldorf financial institution and the Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank could form "the central capital market organization of the savings fund group", the letter said.
WestLB would incorporate a permanently profitable “competence block” into such a business.
Such a link could provide a decisive impetus for further concentrations in the provincial banking sector.
This is the reading of when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
The uncertain WestLB bank continues to be under great pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Supervision Authority, which recently informed the North Rhine-Westphalia province government that it is tightening the deadline to find a lasting solution.
For customers of savings funds, however, between Deka-Bank and WestLB, which is famous for its investment funds, there has been a relationship for a long time - also from the Frankfurt side.
Franz Waas, the head of Deka-Bank, already at the end of August, when presenting the semi-annual data, said that he saw no sense in the merger of the bank on Mainzer Landstraße and a provincial bank such as Helaba or WestLB.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of Deka, one half of which is made up of representatives of provincial banks and the other half of savings associations, has commissioned the Board of Directors to conduct negotiations with WestLB on joint business activities.
This may involve the capital market business or certain parts thereof.
But the negotiations, according to financial circles, have only just begun.
With 3,000 employees, the name of Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial sector, is not the first to emerge in connection with the consolidation of the savings fund sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that Deka-Bank merged with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
Nevertheless, nothing came from this three-party alliance.
The plans were barely disclosed, and the Hessen provincial government spoke against Helaba’s interest.
The other two banks did not find each other.
Instead, the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was transferred to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of the relationship between Deka-Bank and provincial banks has been raised over and over again.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, spoke against plans for mergers with his bank.
However, it is recognized that there is a need for the convergence of different banks in the public sector.
Now, after the Bavarian provincial assembly elections, the first relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, it may slowly run out of potential partners.
In southern Germany, it could only be a younger business partner, although it has experienced the financial crisis far better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was ruled out by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which owns an 85% stake in Helaba, at the beginning of the year.
The NordLB is better off.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank match each other.
Merl stated in June that the German Savings and Fat Association has not yet answered the crucial question of what business model should be used to secure the future of provincial banks.
Eventually, the WestLB may be split, which they obviously do not want there.
Therefore, the letter from the board also states that they are definitely seeking a “complete solution.”
How this can be combined with the merger of the individual units with Deka-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian weekend"
This is the first time for Elena and the third or fourth time for Lucy.
Now, however, Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is quite different, Luca says.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser five-liter barrel, stands a man with a strong beard and tells about 200 people traveling to the Oktoberfest how deep sounds he can sound out of his throat.
Elena first touches Luca’s face, then kisses her.
He arrived in Verona from Bologna.
From here, four buses depart from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova Station at 23:45 p.m. with the destination "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", with arrivals expected at 6:30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly for Italians, the fourth is for Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans were already singing alongside their flags, beginning the celebration during the night.
And so loud that it’s not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long instrumental coat and wide silver-stringed glasses.
He has been traveling to the Oktoberfest for five years, only this year he has organized three trips.
Back home at the Oktoberfest at 22.30 p.m.
Accommodation would only be an unnecessary expense, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, this includes a welcome Kaiser beer cooked in accordance with the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, accident insurance and a German-language tour guide - Marco took a German language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses go into the night on the highway in the direction of "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
The bus is quiet and the passengers are asleep.
This is fine, you will still need your strength.
They take a break in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many Italian buses on Highway 8 also take a short break before Munich.
When Marco’s group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese as planned at half a.m., there are already 50 other buses coming from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering together, while Marco is holding a final briefing, outlining the war plan.
Everyone should wear the yellow hat.
On the left is the inscription "Oktoberfest" with fractural letters, along with the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, “When the doors of the brewery open, run,” Marco cries in the morning.
Running and occupying places in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, for we are stuck, and let not all the yellow hatters sit at the same benches, but let us be scattered in the tent!"
The one-litre pot costs 8.25 euros, Marco shouts.
Do not forget about drinking.
"Show the security guards that you have behaved well.
When you leave your places, they will be occupied.”
Thirdly, “Today at half ten o’clock, be here again!”
We are headed to Wiesn.
On the way, one of the men binds yellow hats to trees, signs, and even an election poster of one of the major Bavarian people’s parties.
You must be prepared for withdrawal.
This is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest, which is known as the "Italian Weekend".
There are no exact figures; 50,000 people are being talked about crossing the Alps in beer bars, with ten percent of all weekend visitors allegedly coming from Italy.
Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrol police officers, with Italian volunteers assisted by the Bavarian Red Cross, which in its national statistics, with about 200 medical services, occupies the first place for the Italians, ahead of the Austrians (approximately 80) and the lowest ranked British (approximately 60).
In Italy, the Hofbräu beer is popular.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Borrowers
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
Fortunately, the politician used the word “relatively” and even insisted that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
Daxon’s Munich-listed real estate financing company Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan subsidies would reach 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate will only have to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes partly from private and partly from public banks.
In the background are the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
Depfa, a government funding firm, has borrowed money for long-term projects and refinanced itself for extremely short-term, which is no longer possible because of the distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the share of equity fell moderately from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Current revenue and net revenue from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, while revenue from credit for claims and certain securities and the liquidation of credit transaction targets fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only due to higher revenues from reimbursement of the ex-Depfa Group’s reimbursement costs, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the tax regulation and transactions made to the companies belonging to the group, a revenue deficit of around 16% was relatively moderate.
After privatization in 1990, the former government funder first speculated on corporate real estate loans, which were later segregated in Aeral Bank.
Because classical government funding could make little, Depfa increased its involvement in infrastructure projects and private-public-partnership (PPP) projects and expanded its activities internationally.
On the value of its subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate now has to carry out descriptions that will have a “significant impact” on the group’s earnings reporting — it was quite generally.
There was no payment of dividends.
The dividend was reduced to a third by 2007.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has become a major government and infrastructure financier.
It relies more on interbank market refinancing than other financial institutions because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending between banks fell as banks kept their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets each year to refinance part of Depfa’s loan portfolio – about €50 billion.
Hypo Real Estate said in a statement that the group’s financing needs were covered by the loan for the foreseeable time and the company was protected “from the influence of currently largely dysfunctional international financial markets.”
According to other sources, refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE, on the other hand, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to resort to the financial markets in the foreseeable time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Supervision Authority (BaFin) believe that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This gives hope to the bank’s shareholders and lenders.
But due to the dynamics and inestimability of the crisis, certain people cannot be sure of it.
It is not unthinkable that the funding should not be fully utilized.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
Since late Saturday evening news that the bank was still on the brink of bankruptcy, even its temporary bailout was unable to calm the moods.
The share price dropped by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bond rates are holding themselves quite well.
While the top-ranked debt rates have rarely changed, the exchange rates for lower-ordered bonds have dropped significantly.
The crisis has affected the bonds of the former subsidiary, Hypo Württemberg, and, in a reasonable way, the maturity periods beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds previously seemed to be a speculative investment alternative, their stamina now depends on the stability of the international financial system due to the exacerbation of the banking crisis and the financial institution’s-to-home crisis with the acquisition of Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are ready to support the system, you can start by paying rent on time.
Or something that almost no one can expect to overcome the financial crisis in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports of partial nationalization, the probability bordering on certainty has now been deprived of legitimate hope.
Long-term lenders may experience sleepless nights when deciding whether to quit their investment.
Short-term investors can, however, use the sale to make a reserve for taxes to be paid on exchange rate gains in the coming years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to show up at Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls start to whisper: The German girl is totally “kavaí”!
What does this mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the mangas - in the new exchange students blog she tells about Japan.
My first day in Japan.
I was very nervous.
I was already on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo, headed to Kavasaki, and I take 40 minutes by train to the Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn’t go wrong.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachiban is not taken as seriously as it is at home in Lower Saxony.
Students start climbing from eight o’clock until 8:40 a.m. a brief conversation with the teacher begins, the “home room”.
But before I started teaching, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have my school uniform yet, I picked up my hostess’s old sweater, a blouse, a blue knee shirt and black leather shoes.
So in this dress I stood in front of the cathedral and tried to say everything correctly: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana ..." - they're called Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and in a week I'll have my birthday.
At this point, I was very happy that I started learning the language for about two years now.
All 31 of the girls were shouting, whispering and whispering, and I heard the word “kavaí” all the time.
I know this from my mango.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls and means “sweet, sweet.”
Then I quickly stood in my place.
The girl sitting next to me smiled widely, feeling honoured to be placed next to the exchange students.
The rest of the clock was quite quiet, but when the bell sounded, they regularly knocked.
Everyone was talking and laughing, and they were drilling a hole in my stomach with their questions – and it was quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
After the break, everyone packed their bags.
My host also prepared such a lunch for me - it's completely different from the boring German ten-hour sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, small sausages, a salad made of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of tofu-roasted meat.
I have no idea what I eat in Japan.
The food looks strange and has a completely new taste.
In fact, everything is very delicious.
Well yes, maybe except for the salty plumber, brrrr!
In Japanese schools, bento is not just lunch.
It happens that a girl gives a boy a hand-made bent, which she assembles especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about this in my manga.
I wonder if I can see this here.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always answered:
“Because it simply fascinates me.”
I have been reading manga for years.
And to better understand the comic books and the culture described in them, I began to learn Japanese at some point.
It was very clear to me that I would have to go here someday.
I am fascinated by traditions and customs.
They are highly valued here.
Japan, on the one hand, is a country of the latest techniques and trends - and on the other hand, it is rigorous, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Even rats have emotions.
A rat or a mole escapes in the event of danger. Does this mean that he feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals also have emotions.
But how can we examine whether they feel the same when they behave like us?
In the online journal "Edge" for years, famous scientists have published their articles.
SPIEGEL ONLINE examines the answers to the question “What do you think is real without being able to prove it?” in one of its series.
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
However, as we examine other species and examine the issues of perception or consciousness in general, we come to a difficult terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some researchers conclude comparable subjective experiences.
However, I do not believe this.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals.
Circuits associated with human consciousness, on the one hand, almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and execution/control functions).
This wide area is more advanced in man than in other primates, and seems to be completely absent in other living beings.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as the awareness of who we are, or the ability to plan and make decisions, it is reasonable to assume that humans are even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since a significant part of human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals are excluded.
However, even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would be influenced by language, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is likely to be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness can be in the case of other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and if it cannot be analyzed by our own experience because of the special hardware, then its research puts us in serious trouble.
Most of my explanations relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is probably more accessible to science.
The conscious processes of animals could be studied regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in the case of experiments on primate short-term memory, especially in the example of visualization.
However, in this hypothesis, which was also examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely on neural connections of consciousness rather than causal mechanisms: Both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this assumption also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the formation of visualization.
What happens to these feelings?
I lead this back to the fact that an emotional system, like fear, is activated in the brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defensive system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies the working memory.
Thus, emotions are closely linked to the areas of the cerebral cortex that are characteristic of primates and especially humans.
In addition to the linguistic nature, perception is divided into subtle degrees, because with the help of words and grammar we are able to distinguish and categorize states so that we can describe them to others in addition to ourselves.
In contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio is of the opinion that emotions originate from the simpler activities of the body-perception areas of the cerebral cortex and brain strain, just like Jaak Pankseep, who, however, is more focused on the brain strain.
Since this network hasn’t changed much over the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in the emotions that encompass the species.
I cannot deny this in theory, but I find it unproven.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fearful in rats and humans is likely to be felt in both cases: How can we check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach is running away in the event of danger, does he also feel fear?
In my opinion, similar behavior alone is not yet evidence of the same experience.
Although neuronal comparisons can help further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, but cockroaches do not have a brain.
But is the brain responsible for emotions?
And even if this could be proven in respect of humans, how could we prove this in respect of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, and maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
I do not know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are suspiciously fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I’m researching rats’ emotional behavior rather than their emotional emotions.
In any case, there is progress in this area at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
As with rats, I don’t study language and consciousness, nor feelings, because I don’t know if they exist.
For others, this may seem like a short-sighted attitude, but I prefer to move forward rather than collide with a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President: Time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunik said the preparations will soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government sees the UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux as a testament to Ukraine’s confidence and a testament to their belief that Ukraine and Poland can organize the European Championship together,” Vaszjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are lagging behind.
It is possible to reduce the number of EB stadiums from eight to six.
“We can’t waste more time.
We need to work at a peak speed now,” said Grigorij Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Federation.
“UEFA will keep an eye on us.”
In Poland, a radical move has been taken.
After several scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN alliance, which was replaced by Independent Supervisory Commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The meeting was held on the initiative of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious danger that PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
“In a letter, we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that this will not negatively affect the preparations for the 2012 European Commission.”
Only in the last season several first-league teams had to be placed in the lower class due to manipulation, and eventually the league was postponed.
Dennis Quaid is back.
The actress wanted to advertise a new film, she spoke about her private life in the interview - and now she had trouble with her ex-husband. Meg Ryan, a Hollywood star, called her ex-husband, Dennis Quaid, an abuser.
Those who rejoice and go back
The War of Delayed Roses for Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid with ex-married couple: The two Hollywood actors fight a ugly battle with each other seven years after their divorce - in public.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan first stated about the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing a lot of pain."
It was only after his divorce that he discovered how many women Dennis had cheated on.
The spiritual striptease took place due to Ryan’s press work on his new film, “The Women,” which tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid, 54, told The New York Daily News: “It’s terrible that Meg is repeating and translating the story of our relationship.”
In addition, it’s also “unfortunate” that 16-year-old common boys, Jacket, are repeatedly “publicly reminded of the much pain and change that a divorce causes a child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since his divorce, Quaid has married again and has recently become a father of twins.
Therefore, his answer ends with the following page cut: "My life will continue anyway.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family where everything is fine.”
Reduced prices for air tickets and hotel rooms
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany have become no less than 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and hotel room prices have again risen, according to a study by American Express, a travel and financial provider.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and saw a significant loss in earnings in the second quarter following price increases in the first quarter.
After years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation has become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices increased by an average of 6.9% in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed compared to 2007.
In the period from April to June, however, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is seen by American Express in the low exchange rate of the dollar, which has led to “a declining desire for American tourists to travel.”
The decline in hotel room prices affects financial centers such as Frankfurt or London more than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
The 26.3% rise in hotel prices in the Norwegian city is a European record.
The price of air tickets also increased in the first quarter.
Passengers in the tourist class paid an average of 7.1% more than in 2007, and long-haul flights with high fuel consumption cost 29.2%.
Between April and June, the average price of tourist class flights dropped by 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first class prices showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices increased by 11.9 percent and decreased by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
The price of domestic flights in Germany has dropped by half.
The reason for the fall in prices is, on the one hand, the slowing economic growth, the company says.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has weakened.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalizes air travel between the U.S. and Europe, increases the pressure of competition.
The tense situation is attested by airlines cancelling their losses flights and a number of airlines bankruptcy in the first half of 2008, with 24 airlines affected in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach by 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV came to the top of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning team.
Kristoffer Klein extension Deep flight for national team Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player came into play only late, and his lift was kicked back from the gate.
His message clearly came out of his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
“We need a second goal,” said Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break was over, and most were sitting in their places again.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for HSV for three decades, enjoying greater authority than some former gamers.
His request was heard in the appropriate place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and agreed to point his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg coach Martin Jol.
His command could be the same: Come with the second goal!
The order is missing.
“Today it wasn’t always beautiful,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt also “imagined” the matter.
The goal score of 1: 0 (1: 0) is due to the head of the hamburger Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that the very weak gladbachians could not cause pain to the weak hamburgers.
“It was a great victory,” said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
Spectators had already celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the projector, which presented their team as the first class of the championship.
It would be a birthday party.
“We know where to go,” Marcell Jansen said.
He understands that the intermediate evidence of the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of HSV.
Although the team is slowly reaching out thanks to its late dedicated pieces – Brazil’s Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric and FC Bayern’s Jansen – it’s not yet brilliant.
“We need more senses and action,” Jol said.
After the disappearance
Wall Street is scared.
Following the first news of the bankruptcy, the Dow Jones dropped 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss in one day in its history.
Later, the Dow increased slightly.
At 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer was down by more than 5 percent at 10,579 points.
Nasdaq, which trades technology securities, fell by more than seven percent to 1,458 points.
Dow’s biggest loser at the moment was American Express with a loss of 14 percent, followed by Bank of America with 12 percent.
None of the papers grew.
Goldman Sachs shares fell by 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, a major investor, Warren Buffett, bought a stake in the bank.
As part of the rescue operation, funds are planned to be made available for the purchase of so-called dubious mortgages.
However, the amount is not paid simultaneously, but gradually.
In exchange, the state would receive vouchers for the stock options of financial institutions, which would be redeemable if the exchange rates evolved appropriately, reducing the burden on the state treasury.
European and American stock markets
Billions of dollars of aid to European and American banks have not dissipated investor doubts.
The stock price of the major German bank Hypo Real Estate is falling, taking Dax with it.
The U.S. Dow Jones is falling despite the government’s plans to save the financial market.
Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have dropped the German equity index (Dax).
The value of the Munich real estate funding company’s shares fell by a quarter despite the federal government and private banks’ bailouts, and Commerzbank weakened by more than 20 percent.
The Dax dropped below the psychologically important 6000-point threshold and scored a minus 3.7 percent of 5839 points.
Stock markets around the world are on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors fear the US government’s $700 billion bailout plan will not be enough to boost financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trading, falling 3.3 percent to 10.809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives will vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate will vote on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges have only one direction known: in London, the FTSE index weakened by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent to 11.743.61 points after the initial boost.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slid down by 2.1% to 18.286.90 points.
The Indian Sensex index fell by 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75.
On the Mdax stock exchange, Arcandor shares weakened after the announcement of the capital increase.
The private bank Sal Oppenheimer has signed 23 million new shares.
The company also said it would not sell Thomas Cook shares.
Dark matter affects the flight of spacecraft
A mysterious phenomenon has caused disagreement among researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of the spacecraft during the so-called swing-by manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The "Ulysses" spacecraft has been in space for 18 years.
Fuel pipelines are in danger of freezing.
For years, scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon called the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by refers to the gravitational stroke of the spacecraft, during which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
Thus, the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens spacecraft, like the Ulysses, also used this physical trick.
What has surprised scientists for years, however, is that flying objects do not behave fully as expected under the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, disturbances occur in speed.
The probes unexpectedly accelerate or slow down.
Physicists have not yet found an explanation for this effect.
This phenomenon is called a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that not even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity can be completely correct, which perceives the attraction of matter as the curvature of space.
American physicist Stephen Adler, a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, continues to firmly believe that Einstein was not wrong and is trying to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter that astronauts have discovered in the universe.
"The anomaly may be caused by dark matter, which may even be near Earth," Adler writes.
Space scientists discovered the existence of dark matter only ten years ago.
Obviously, it exerts a gravitational force that can be observed to affect other celestial bodies.
However, the matter itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists estimate that about one-fifth of the mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Turists Abducted in Egypt
After ten days in captivity, Egyptian tourists have been released, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers demanded millions of euros in ransom.
In the shooting before the release of the hostages, six hostages were allegedly killed.
Five German citizens were abducted in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom are already ongoing.
Again and again, Germans are the target of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports the most important cases.
European tourists in the Sahara are free.
This was by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: “Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently investigating their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian citizen and eight Egyptian escorts are safe and safe, Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are allegedly already on their way to Cairo.
The cause of the shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: An Egyptian security official said the hostages had already shown a willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of them.
“The problem has been solved.
They accepted the ransom," the official said.
"It was only about taking the hostages at the trial," when suddenly the "surprise" occurred.
Sudanese troops on Sunday shot six kidnappers on the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two.
The hostages demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should have been handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The Al-Masri al-Jom newspaper, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, the hostages will release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men are detained until they find a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a stand on the report.
“Self-suicide” caused by violence
In court it was stated that a woman committed suicide because her father-in-law had raped her for years.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians County, Cornwall, has spent six years in prison after confessing to an eight-point attempt at violent sexual disclosure.
The Truro Criminal Court found out that she regularly bound her mother-in-law, Stephanie Randle, between the ages of five and seven.
In one of Trerise’s confessions, he wrote, “I feel responsible for his death.”
Randle committed suicide at the age of 34 in his home in the Mutley district of Plymouth on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise bound her eyes before having intercourse while her mother was working in a brewery.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and again chose Cornwall as his residence.
He moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it was revealed that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteering for the National Trust Monument Protection organization, was pursued by horrors of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, Attorney Ramsey Quaife told the court that Mrs. Randle, who previously loved surfing and cycling with a passion, was “emotionally dead” and “abandoned life” according to her friends.
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably drowned himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle had a quarrel with his daughter’s father-in-law, who concluded his testimony in a letter, saying, “I’ve always tied her and tied her eyes.
I was not sexually harassed.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, “You’re an extremely strange fetish, and you’re sure this was awful for your victim, especially if she was just seven years old.
This unpleasant family story ended with the victim committing suicide.
Even more remarkable, however, is the fact that if he did not do so, the case might never have been brought to court."
The judge added: “I’m drawing attention to how Stephanie’s parents say the crime you’ve committed has affected their daughter over the years.
If that didn’t happen, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman.”
Officer who lost important data has been charged
According to the BBC, a government official who forgot strictly classified documents on a train in June was charged with violating official secrecy.
The man was in a defense ministry mission when he left two strictly secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the slightest charge related to the violation of the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional commission.
Frank Gardner, a BBC defense correspondent, said the move surprised many at Whitehall.
"They believed the defense ministry and the government would treat the case as an internal matter," he said.
An employee who cannot be named has been charged under Section 8.1 of the Act.
The prosecutor’s office suggested that the indictment against the official be represented by the Metropolitan Police because of the man’s rather sensitive work with the Joint Intelligence Commission.
The documents he lost included secret surveys of al-Qaeda and the Iraqi military’s capabilities.
He was informed of the decision on Monday and then moved from his home to an unknown place.
Housing cooperatives pay the bill of B&amp;B
Britain's housing cooperatives can count on more than £80 million in bills after saving the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government spent £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million account holders placed at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of depositors, including 59 housing cooperatives.
Adrian Coles, chairman of the Association of Housing Cooperatives (BSA), said it’s “irritating” that companies and their members have to pay.
The $14 billion loan will eventually be repaid after Bradford & Bingley’s mortgages have been repaid.
However, the accumulated interest will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing cooperatives are also among them.
It is annoying that institutions that have acted cautiously ... must now pay bills to institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that each company must pay the proportion of the amount of deposit it holds.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of the loan will reach £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to set aside £81 million to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, the general director of the union of housing companies, told the BBC he considered the measure unfair.
“It’s disappointing that those institutions have to pay bills to much less cautious institutions that acted cautiously during the boom of the housing market.”
BSA says no company has collapsed since it started operations in 1945.
"We need to examine this matter in every aspect in the next few weeks to decide how we can protect housing companies and their members from the significant amount of bills," Cole added.
The interest payable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March of this year.
In 2010, you will have to pay an annual interest rate, which may be twice the current rate.
Since housing cooperatives are self-help organizations, without shareholders, members will eventually have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or lower interest rates received on their deposits.
The price of milk will rise by five pennies per liter.
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of milk by another five pennies per liter from Monday.
This is the second price hike this year since the two-penny hike in February and following a survey conducted by a consulting firm.
It is the resellers themselves who decide whether to forward the price increase to consumers.
Before the February rise, Jersey’s wholesale milk price last changed in 2002.
Former Bangladeshi MP Rejects Request for Release
A court in Bangladesh has rejected the former MP Sheikh Hasina’s request for his defence release, meaning he could be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer said the court had denied him the right to defend himself in prison on charges of blackmailing a businessman for $50 million ($729,700) while he was in parliament.
This is just one of many corruption charges against him.
Sheikh Hasina's former political opponent, Khaleda Ziad, was released this month on bail.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, is demanding that the country's military-backed interim government give him full freedom first.
According to reports, although he was conditionally released to receive medical treatment abroad, the conditions for his release do not clearly indicate whether he can retain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
“The Court of Appeal rejected Sheikh Hasina’s request for bail on the grounds that it was not necessary because he was already temporarily released and is undergoing medical treatment abroad,” we learned from lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
“We will appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal.”
His lawyers say he needs to be defended in order to return to the country and prepare for the elections in December.
A leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
He was arrested last year after the interim government, backed by the military, took power, but was released from prison in June to receive medical treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny any charges against them.
Polio vaccination program in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, 200,000 Afghan children are missing from the recent polio vaccination program due to violence linked to the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations organized vaccination campaigns in six provinces.
However, they said they could not reach children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said this was done despite the Taliban’s pledge that it would not attack or hinder the work of thousands of people working on the vaccine.
BSkyB’s appeal against ITV rejected
BskyB’s appeal against the Competition Commission’s decision ordering it to reduce its interest in the rival TV station, ITV, was rejected.
The Competition Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
Earlier, the committee found that BSkyB’s shareholding hampers competition and gives the company an unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB acquired its stake in 2006, effectively preventing NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority that the shares purchased by BSkyB from ITV threatened the independence of ITV, urging the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
Virgin CEO Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the oversight of Ofcom all opposed the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its ITV stake was meaningless and disproportionate compensation – given that BSkyB has stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. prosecutors
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the 2006 dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors.
The move followed a report prepared by the Chief Justice Inspector on the case that criticized the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former chief prosecutor Alberto González.
The investigation was ordered because it was fearful that prosecutors would be fired for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interrogated during the investigation attempted to hinder justice by lying.
"Serious allegations of a possible crime have not yet been investigated, nor have they been clarified," said inspector-general Glenn Fine.
One of his main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor who would have the power to force witnesses to testify.
In December 2006, the U.S. Justice Department removed nine prosecutors from office.
At the time, it was said that state prosecutors were fired because of their poor performance.
However, it was later revealed that the dismissed prosecutors received no worse ratings than many of their colleagues.
Some prosecutors participated in the prosecution of senior Republican congressional members, while others refused to participate in the investigation of allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors, on behalf of the government, conduct investigations and conduct court cases.
They may be removed from their positions at any time, but they may not be removed from their positions for political reasons.
The then chief of the judiciary, chief prosecutor Alberto Gonzales, became the target of attacks because of the redundancies and eventually resigned.
Several other officials in the judiciary also filed their resignations.
In his report, the chief inspector strongly criticized Gonzales' role in the case, saying that the chief prosecutor had "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, "resigned" from his leadership role, and "straightly pulled himself out" from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, a former assistant to senior Bush, have been criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf epoch receives recognition
Rock star Meat Loaf will be recognized at the Q Awards gala for her epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive his special Gold Prize at the ceremony in London next week, said he was honored to receive the award.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty-five seconds, was the title song for Meat Loaf’s 1977 album.
Coldplay received the most nominations for this year’s awards in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that transcend the boundaries of time or genres, and ‘Bat Out Of Hell’ is like that.”
The song earned by Jim Steinman required a very loud tone, and that sound was Meat Loafé.
The song began with a almost two-minute instrumental episode.
It appeared as a single in 1979 and reached the 15th place on the hit lists.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" has been on the charts for almost nine years, and has since sold more than 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - recently struggled with health problems. Among other things, in 2003 she underwent surgery for heart rhythm disorders after crashing on stage.
In 2007, he was forced to cancel several concerts due to severe laryngitis.
Later it turned out that a cyst was found on the voice thread.
An unknown metropolitan street that is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of boulevards, routes and other sideways. Some of them are famous, others perform purely practical functions.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-lived locals would find it difficult to tell where Extra Place is located, mostly because they have never heard of it before.
The small street is in East Village and runs north of First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Street.
It is approximately 9 m wide and 36 m long, and much more resembles a dusty street than a main transportation route.
There are no streets.
It is practically impossible to find it on a standard map.
There are fans on the street.
There is, for example, Avalon Bay, the builder of the recently built First Street luxury buildings.
You want to cover the Extra Place again, and you want to make sure you get to the shops and boutiques of the new buildings on a cleaner road.
Among the admirers of the street are the neighbors who have long lived here, who were caught in the streets that it was the only remnant of the neighborhood’s past before the renovations.
However, the street owner, the city’s building conservation and development department, has no interest in insisting on it.
This month, at a meeting of the district municipality’s land management committee, representatives from the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street to remain in the management of the city and has requested a new plan to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, district head of municipality number 3.
"There are very few areas already in the city's possession, and we want the Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," he said.
"There may be suggestions for the renovation and management that Avalon can do, but we also want to ensure it remains available to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to cover the small street again and provide seats. Some of these would be used by a cafe, whose builder is expected to rent a area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first announced at this month’s session.
A spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, Michele de Milly, said that while the company wants to use the street, it doesn’t insist on owning it.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renovate this ruined street and turn it into a pleasant public place," he said, adding that the city had suggested its purchase.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office for Building Conservation, said the city really wanted to sell the street, noting that the office’s job was to develop the buildings, not manage them.
Compared to its more colourful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has little historical significance.
Some say it was named "Nobody's Land" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's vast estate was divided among his countless children, and no one claimed the narrow strip of land.
The back exit of the 2006 punk-rock monument, the CBGB, opened to the Extra Place, and the street is the most famous for taking a photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a great location," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager who took the photo in November 1976.
“It was full of garbage, clothes, pieces of barrels and posters, and sheets and ropes.”
Some residents, including bloggers who write about how the middle class took possession of East Village, oppose the sale of the Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, no matter how modest, should remain in the possession of the community.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rarity, a piece of the city that has remained virtually unchanged and should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, author of the blog “The Disappearing New York of Jeremiah” (“The Book of Thrones: The Bitter Nostalgia of the City’s Disappearance”), posted on his blog part of the story of Extra Place, which appeared in The New Yorker’s “City Rumor” section in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote, “Extra Place is a narrow, small canyon that is dark even during the day, bordered by rust, iron warehouse doors and slated windows, and where weekly newspapers are carried by the wind through the channels.”
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran through the end of the street next to the back door that used to lead to the CBGB and now belongs to a higher-priced clothing store set up on its site.
There were graffiti on the walls, and an empty 0.75-litre beer bottle lay next to a dumped pile of fresh newspaper paper.
Some passers said that they rarely think of the Extra Place, but they think it would fit for renovation.
Fields said he believes some people underestimate the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
“I’ve spent the most beautiful years of my life in dark, dirty, and tasteless places,” she said.
Debate on Bilingual Education: Continuing Exposure to the English Language Environment
In this section of the Education Monitor, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates’ views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, who is an experienced researcher in California Studies at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research and senior director of educational research, is the co-author of the book “Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school choice.”
It’s not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are also included.
According to Obama’s campaign, “Afro-American and Spanish-speaking students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and that’s true.
In order to overcome such performance gaps, Obama’s educational plan specifically promotes, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English-language learners.
At the same time, for Obama, the question is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes non-English school teaching, outweighs his interest in overcoming large performance gaps.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep Contract Elementary School in the eastern part of Los Angeles County.
Most of the school’s students are Spanish-speaking and have low incomes.
More than one-third of our students, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
However, 100% of fourth-grade students achieved excellent results in the 2008 State Mathematics Examination.
Similarly impressive, 93% of fourth-grade students performed excellently in the English language and literature exam.
This incredible achievement was not achieved by the means that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street emphasizes repetition, practice, continuous assessment of skills, and rejection of excuses.
Additionally, and that’s what Obama should consider, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s educational principle is “full immersion” of students studying English in the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of English in the teaching of other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual teaching, said: “We’ve had an overwhelming success in the fact that if someone walked into a classroom, they’t realize who the student who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months ago was.”
“It works,” he said, “for us it works.”
Would Obama put schools like Sixth Street Prep as an example to be followed by other schools that teach a significant number of Spanish-speaking and English-learning students?
The school’s achievements should be a clear answer, but because of its own party’s education policy (National Educational Associations have long supported bilingual education), and because it itself is consistently in favor of bilingual education, we can’t be sure of Obama’s reaction.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama has recently disregarded the issue when he said people shouldn’t worry so much about the “exclusively English nature” of legislation.
Instead, he said, “They should get their children to speak Spanish.”
If Obama really wants to reduce the differences between results, he should seriously study the models that work, instead of neglecting and ignoring them.
Oil prices have fallen sharply due to economic concerns.
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that the U.S. financial market rescue plan will not be able to revive the economy.
Oil prices fell 7 percent to $99.80 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Prices have dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial turmoil on Wall Street and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel earlier this month before being affected again by immense uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, concerns regained the power of investors even after congressional leaders announced that they had reached an agreement over the economic bailout over the weekend, the largest ever.
The news has been shadowed by concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
As the latest event in the emerging crisis, Citigroup will acquire Wachovia Corporation’s banking business, the government announced on Monday.
Meanwhile, the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, as a result of the desperate negotiations over the weekend, “the bailout seems to have failed to revitalize the stock market sentiment.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, such as oil, is also expected to decline.
"The future of the stock market, interest rates and exchange rates around the world has become uncertain," a Deutsche Bank analyst wrote to investors.
“We believe that the commodity market will not be avoided by the ‘epidemic’.
The biggest question in terms of commodity markets is to what extent the “sickness” of the United States is infecting the whole world, especially China.”
As oil consumption declined due to a slowdown in economic growth, bank analysts cut their forecasts for next year by 20 percent, lowering their 2009 oil and gas prices forecasts.
In the second quarter, the team set a record.
After spending more time in the Jets than anyone else in the last eight seasons, Shaun Ellis in the defensive end position thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational match.
“I’ve never seen anything like that before,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals’ hard-to-play match was fully aligned with the dark clouds on the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback, gave Laveranues Coles a 12-yard touchdown pass. This became a perfect precursor for an afternoon during which their collaboration developed significantly further.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes in this quarter, including when two successive cornerbacks fell 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't regret the effort," Favre said of all the passes he gave to Coles.
“Pokoli is a good player.
So far we were able to communicate well with each other, regardless of what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing the ball, the defense stopped Cardinals manager Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, playing in the cornerback position, caught a bad throw and threw it back with 32 yards, which meant a touchdown.
Eric Smith, a safety player, went into another pass and won the ball.
David Bowens, the linebacker, managed to get the ball out of Warner’s hand.
This last turn could have been the most incredible moment in the game.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end and the Jets won it, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, setting a 34-0 score.
This was the best result the Jets have achieved in a quarter so far.
When asked by Jets coach Eric Mangini to characterize the disruptive nature of the game, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When he was told that both – in the third quarter the Cardinals scored 21 points without the Jets scored one – Mangini said: “I have to say that I the second quarter much more than the third.
We got a lot of points in a short time.”
Gebrselassie breaks its own world record
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why he is considered by many to be the best mid- and long-distance runner ever, when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday, making him the first to run the 42.2 km in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on a comfortable flat track at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds from his previous score at 2:04:26, which he achieved last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record of his career in such a wide range of fields that he won a world championship or set a world record in almost every run from 1500 meters to a marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon fearing—which, in retrospect, may have proved to be excessive caution—that air pollution could further aggravate her asthma problems.
He participated in the Berlin Marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - in sunny weather, initially at 9 °C and eventually at 13 °C - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, with an incredible speed of 2 minutes and 56 seconds per kilometer.
Since previously non-marathon runners such as Gebrselassie and Kenyan Paul Tergat have turned to longer distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the last decade since Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in 1998 in Berlin with a score of 2:06:05.
Following Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had his two legs crushed and was unable to train for two weeks.
Obviously, during the compulsory rest, he was refreshed and did not roast.
“I’m so happy,” Gebrselassie told reporters.
“Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had doubts, but eventually everything went well.”
He has received some criticism – especially from Kenya, Ethiopia’s Eastern African rival – that he uses too much assistive equipment in his races, generally avoids many world-renowned marathon runners, relies on his runners as if he ran on a track, and puts world records ahead of the spirit of competition.
However, this criticism hardly diminishes Gebrselassie’s greatness in long-distance runs.
Gebrselassie reached the half-point on Sunday with the help of four Kenyan runners at 1:02:04.
Two leading Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the runners were tired.
Not much more than 4.8 kilometers before the finish, Gebrselassie missed Kwambai with a final sprint, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his individual best by 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, who is now a German citizen, closed a remarkable year with her seventh fastest victory, 2:19:19.
The World Cup will be held by the British Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon with a score of 2:24:14.
He was not allowed to attend the Beijing Olympics because of his alleged back injury, but he quickly recovered and won the Berlin Marathon, where he improved his individual peak by five minutes.
He won the race with a clever calculation: first, he allowed a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain significant leadership, and then followed them after running about 30 km.
Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second with 2:21.31 while Kenyan Helena Kiprop finished third with 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and trials of the blacks
The Greater Orlando Experience Park, a few miles from everything that is shining, loud and huge, hides a quiet little town where the pride and complexity of the African American life experience is born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to integrate into the country, and which was the home of Zora Neale Hurston’s childhood, is now no longer as simple as she described in 1935: “a city of five lakes, three crochet tracks, 300 brown leather, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guayavas, and two schools without prison.”
Now it is a caveat.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have already attended the annual Zora Festival. The eatonville ceremony series is held in honour of Harlem Renaissance’s most famous female writer, Hurston.
Nevertheless, in many ways, the city he described and made a tourist attraction – which is also included in the Florida Guide published by the Project of Federal Writers of the Crisis – stands apart from its surroundings.
Just as independent, dignified, and closed as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that Florida’s city black people were often reluctant to share their true thoughts with white people who “know so little about us that they don’t know what they’re missing.”
Even in the year when the black presidential candidate, Barack Obama, encourages an open discussion on the racial issue, many here are distrustful of outsiders’ views.
"We are very careful about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, who has lived here all his life and is a member of the oldest church in the city.
“You have to tell it correctly.”
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historic model of black exhibition, but at the same time a community of 2,400 people, where poverty rates reach twice the national average.
It is partly a literary node, and partly an example of a southern, urban, black culture, sometimes despised, sometimes praised, which was created as a result of American slavery, flourishing in the shade of oak trees.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the residents here are both proud and defensive at the same time.
And the image of Eatonville has been important since Zora (everyone here calls it Hurston).
In books written in an honest, strong dialect — such as “Mules and Men” (1935) and “Their Eyes Were Watching God” (1937) — he presented his hometown to the world.
The five paragraphs of the Florida Guide have transformed the city, which lies next to Road 17. This road leads from the long-forgotten center of Florida to one of the sites of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was both brave in life and literature as well as drumming, introduced his readers to the business of Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then went into the more confidential spheres.
So he wrote: "Right of the road we find a modern public school, with a white edge on a brown foundation, carefullyined courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller takes care of, though he can barely write and read."
He mentioned Widow Dash’s new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn “sells all kinds of drinks and anything you might need in the temporary accommodation.”
Thus, in a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with autonomy, but also with illiteracy, re-marriage, and sex.
Obviously, Fodor's guide showed it differently.
This description did not really please everyone.
"Zora said things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls. Hurston made them immortal by quoting from the slick songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, “Some people don’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered here as the alien who frequently visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston entered the city, he usually arrived without notice in a whirling Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes and in long trousers to a city where people are still proud of their dignified dress.
He fascinated most people, said Franklin, but many were phytomized.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he shrugged his chair, adding, "He never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were no longer re-published.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with much of the world, had forgotten about it.
Although he was once a popular writer, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in a homeless tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he previously lived.
There were no major commemorations or large public lectures in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood how much it enriched the world or what it left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's Biography, published in 2003, entitled "Wrapped in the Rainbow."
The turning point came in 1980.
Officials in Orange County wanted to build a five-lane road through the city instead of the two-lane main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the life of the community.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the Interstate 4 motorway linking the states on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering after a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, among other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggles with racial mixing sparked hatred against the community.
"At that time, a group of white boys came over and threw people sitting on the side of the road with oranges and other things," Franklin said.
“There was a woman who died in this.
They threw a strawberry out of a car.”
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s decision to impose forced integration, stating about the decision, “Brown v. Board of Education,” that he would “offend rather than respect my race.”
Today, residents say that even though the school segregation has been positive in some ways, it has weakened the unity of the Eatonville people and undermined the self-confidence of young people.
“Black children are accustomed to being hugged – I remember this – man hugged his teacher in the morning and in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, executive director of the non-profit organization Save the Eatonville Community.
"It lasted as long as students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
"We didn't embrace our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there were cultural differences between us," Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped the rise of many other Zora Neale Hurston – black writers, actors, and artists who have surpassed prejudice, as she did, with such cheerful self-confidence and lines like, “How can anyone deprive himself of the enjoyment of my company!
This is incomprehensible to me.”
In 1975, Alice Walker pilgrimated to Hurston's homeless tomb and began to struggle to restore her reputation.
Five years later, a prestigious Hurston biography written by Robert E. Hemenway was placed on the shelves of bookstores, putting him once again among America’s best models.
The road construction project would have started just when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time Hurston’s old neighbors saw him as a savior.
In 1988, the community began organizing a Hurston Festival to show what would ruin the county with its main road.
Thousands of fans have attended the opening event two years later, and since then many have returned to the ceremony every January.
A few years later, the county abandoned its road construction proposal.
"Because of the five-lane upgrading of the main road, the community has been revived, connected at full speed, which is a real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said, “Zora saved Eatonville.”
The victory over the road construction project helped change the image of the city itself.
An increasing number of people outside the city appeared, such as lawyer Rachelle Munson, who started visiting the church here in 1993, and the locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the National Historical Register in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-story library (naturally named after Hurston) was opened on the refurbished and embellished Kennedy Street.
Eatonville still remains Florida’s cockroach egg: it’s not just ten kilometers from downtown Orlando, but sometimes it feels like it’s a suburban sidewalk during summer rains; it’s as small as when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
90% of the population is black.
They are still welcomed with caution by outsiders who come here in search of the story of Eatonville.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things—such as Eatonville’s oldest fresco painted by a white man and depicting black people working on the ground—are not allowed to be photographed.
In Eatonville, many people—including the confident Jones teacher who is attracted to the bright red—are afraid of being misunderstood by their separated community.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival grew, the pride of the hometown grew.
Especially young people are increasingly seeing Eatonville as Hurston saw his own race: wonderful, with its problems and with everything else, neither better nor worse, as proud, creative, diligent, foolish and confused as the other racial and ethnic groups in America.
An honest civil bond is silenced from the words of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after graduating from college to work for the local government or the police, which he believes needs help.
And it seems that even the younger ones have learned to properly characterize Eatonville, such as the 11-year-old twin couple in Winter Park: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
“Most of the people who just travel through here think this city is nothing compared to the rest,” Alondra Kenon recently said on a Sunday after the worship.
“But if you stop and take some time to learn about its history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
We all in New York speak the language of finance.
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If the tourists didn’t care about the newspapers and the huge TV shows on Times Square, they’t realize they’re in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with the glass-walled, bee-shaped offices over their heads, the bankers and venture capital managers who are in power over New York City are living the hardest days since 1929.
Couriers still roll their metal tea carts through the sidewalks, carrying dishes loaded with muffins for their morning meetings.
Men with Spanish lips are still whispering among the cluster houses, wearing fifty-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand, hanging on their shoulders.
Office workers are still in line for their breakfast sweets at the food trucks standing on the sidewalk, and it’s still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon.
I didn’t feel that there would be any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the alarming news, I decided to open a new bank account.
While I intentionally planned to do it in the afternoon at my local branch at JP Morgan Chase, there were about 20 people in front of me.
Not at the bank wallet window where money can be picked up or deposited, but at the customer service desk where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for guidance to the Macy's store and where new customers open bank accounts.
Many before me, I learned later from Starr, the bankier "committed to me," stood in line with the same intention as me.
However, unlike me, they have already withdrawn their money from smaller banks in their place of residence, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called savings banks (which are like housing cooperatives), credit cooperatives, and small-city savings funds that operate only in one state and are allegedly treating their customers as family members.
In the past year, 15 such banks have been quietly ruined.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $327 billion, has been under bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers went home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, has sought a bank rescue buyer with savings of $440 billion.
The office and store workers in front of me, afraid of another collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, to the bank that carried out most capital injections on Wall Street.
Simple people in New York City have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman in a local Chinese store spoke on the phone about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and its huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she was complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniform caretaker of my apartment block, was talking about it, and we were not talking about Brad and Angelina, or my food shipment, as usual.
He said to me after I went to the bank: “I invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I changed, I didn’t take any risks.”
Muslim tombs blasphemed while Austria leaned to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, from the right-wing Belgian Vlaams Belang Party, participated in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 in which the organization “Cities Against the Islamic Conquest” was presented.
They drove with traffic signs imitating mosques crossed by a red line.
Police say far-right extremists are responsible for blaspheming Muslim cemeteries in Austria that occurred on the same weekend when far-right parties advanced significantly in the country’s parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Traun Cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to police.
The perpetrators painted Jewish symbols, such as the David Star, on some of the tombs, but the investigators say they were trying to hide their extremist motives that stem from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is in any way linked to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" to hear of the grave defamation, which took place shortly before the end of the Muslim month of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting a conscientious poll following yesterday’s parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political balance slides to the right.
The two far-right parties, which won 30 percent of the vote, Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria campaigned for a strong anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were labeled xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 percent of the vote, has also expressed his opposition to headwashes and burkas, as well as disappointment with foods allegedly linked to Islam.
At the party’s final general assembly in Vienna, he spoke of a “European Brotherhood” that could help prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses conducted immediately after the elections brought the extreme right victory, show that the change was largely due to the young voter base, who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter banned from traveling abroad
Garry Glitter, who was convicted of raping children, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months after he notified the authorities that he intended to travel through France to Spain.
Kentucky police obtained a travel ban on Thursday after submitting evidence to the court of convictions against Glitter in connection with rape of children.
Glitter, whose real name was Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford Magistrates trial in Kentucky, but was represented by Corker Binning’s lawyers.
A court spokesman said: “On Thursday, September 25, the Kentucky police filed a petition with the Ashford Magistrates Court for blocking Paul Gadd’s planned trip to France and Spain on March 25.
“Paul Gadd did not appear in person.”
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because he is required to do so under the Sexual Offenders Register Act.
You must notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You must also notify the police at least seven days before your planned departure.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years.
Kentucky police said they did not want to talk about individual cases and possible locations within Glitter County.
A spokesman for the Kentucky police said: “The Kentucky police are doing everything they can to protect children in the country and abroad.
“We think it’s easier to control someone without leaving the UK because we have a comprehensive system here to manage potential risks more effectively.
“The Kentucky Police consider it the most important task to protect the population of Kent. Through close cooperation, we are continuously monitoring the behavior of persons registered with sexual offences and living in the county to minimize potential risks to the population.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10- and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to take a plane to London.
However, he claimed he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Indian authorities did not allow him to pass the passport check, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry into the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where police and immigration officials insisted he should return to Britain.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Court in West London, after a court order had been issued to include sexual offenders in the register, at the request of Scotland Yard.
Glitter previously spent four months in jail in the UK in 1999 for possession of photographs depicting child rape.
According to an interior ministry source, Interior Secretary Jacqui Smith welcomed with reassurance and pleasure that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't take pictures on stage because I want to present the artist from a personal side" Günther Bauer Photographer
There are no hairstyles, no dancing shoes.
The great masters of flamenco are close to the body, without the excitement of acting: to get to know the ordinary faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, ordinary people.
And these two sides cannot be separated except in the intimate, distant moments from the audience, when one can take a personal move, grasp the depth of a captured gaze, or grasp the beauty of the actless, yet expressive hand of the artist who is about to perform on stage.
In the German photographic series “Flamenco-people” by Günther Bauer, he combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with the less-known everyday side of the masters.
Through the photos, she shows the flamenco’s distinctive iconography from different perspectives.
The exhibition, which is part of the Month of Flamenco Photography, "reflects the growing international importance of flamenco from day to day," the creator believes, adding that the flamenco-people "should be the protagonist of anyone, since when viewing the images, the observer finds that these images do not represent artists in a typical way.
These people on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and captivate the audience.
However, stage photography is not suitable for capturing their personality.
Their personality and character dwell in the depths of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture the personality of the flamenco with the help of the camera.”
The Cante de las Minas festival inspired Bauer to embark on a long journey in 1997, during which he took portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers using a disc camera.
These portraits draw back to classical photography thanks to the camera and the choice of themes.
The application of various stylistic tools, however, breaks with traditional visual representation and suggests modernity.The following thought faithfully reflects Bauer's vision of flamenco: "It is a music with traditional roots, which, however, changes from day to day and is always impressive."
It is not the dance, not the singing or the music in itself, but rather the artist’s personality and character that enchants the audience.
These days, the guiding motif of the works that can be viewed in the El Fotómata gallery is the search for the encounter with the essence, the artistic magic, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and presentation.
The names of famous flamenco figures, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, symbolize this collection of photographs featuring sixty artists.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be covered by an album of portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauert’s passion for portraits prompted him to repeat the idea two years ago with the series “Portraits of Veterans Athletes” (“SportARTproject”).
Although the concept of the Flamenco-people is slightly different from this, the photographer adds: “I really like to photograph people, get to know them and get into their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult art of photography is portrait.
The fate brings you together with people you meet, with personalities you sometimes don’t even know, or who only spend a few minutes photographing.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
The flamenco-people exhibition, selected from portraits of contemporary flamenco, can be viewed at the El Fotómata Gallery at calle de la Mata 20 parallel to Alameda de Hércules until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he’s working on is “prepared audacity”
Mario Vargas Llosa is still working on writing a new novel, the protagonist of which is an Irish nationalist named Roger Caseman, who has lived in Congo for twenty years and travelled through the Amazon.
A Nobel Prize-winning writer at the Hay Festival Segovia yesterday admitted that his current work is "a complete bravery" and "all signs indicate that it should not be written" the novel.
"If I were smarter, I't do it, but I will do it and I hope that someday I will be able to finish it," he concluded his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, ideas and opinions, which has welcomed hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of visitors for four days in the city of Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the celebration of literature and also fulfilled the hopes placed on him.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival award voted by the participants, an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Common Friend".
Following the greeting of Félix Romeo, he was welcomed by a dedicated audience. The audience soon met the hour during which the Peruvian writer, with a wonderful memory and a great dose of humor, told how his vocation as a writer emerged from the special adventure of his passion for reading and the desire to live life; how he wiped inspiration through his disciplined method of writing, diligent documentation, many repairs and rewritings; how his vocation was influenced by writers Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and on what memorials his stories are based.
The Latin American novelist acknowledged that it was impossible to measure or demonstrate whether books change our lives, but added, “I don’t think that literature is merely a fun or a pure-life experience” because it affects people and drives them to think, so he asked writers not to succumb to the seduction of lightness and bear responsibility for their vocation.
Due to the harsh weather, the Pozoblanco farewell is shorter, and the horse-to-be races are also delayed
Traditionally held as the closing record of the Pozoblanco holidays, the horse-bowl was cancelled from the show yesterday morning after future horse torradores found the arena's terrain unsuitable for the competition.
As a result, the committee, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to discontinue the bull race.
Unfortunately, the weather disrupted the ceremony, as two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the second bowl was stopped due to the rain.
The future protagonists, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, would have fought with the Castilblanco bulls.
There was a bullfight on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who brought home three ears as a trophy. After a sophisticated and aesthetic battle, he was surrounded by an elevated shoulder.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante won several awards and trophies through his two bulls, but this was due more to the audience than to his own performance.
These, however, followed by El Juli, who contributed little to the aging reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable run with the second bull, most of the audience was able to get out of the wheel.
A truck carrying two tons of hashish tried to escape road control
It is four o’clock in the morning, fifty minutes.
The Basque Regional Police carries out traffic controls in the administrative area of Armiñón (Álava).
The authorities stop a van in which two passengers are travelling.
The shipment, more than two tons of hashish, at the same time, was not striking.
Investigators pursued the passengers, and one, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A.A.J., the Basque government’s Department of Home Affairs said.
The man is charged with drug trafficking and counterfeiting documents.
The incident occurred in the administrative district of Armiñón, where employees of the Álava Traffic Inspectorate carried out traffic checks on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas, and then left the place of inspection.
Investigators pursued him, then the vehicle stopped a few kilometers further on the stop lane, and his passengers fled from the highway to a forested area.
The Bask Regional Police finally captured one of them and, after searching the Iveco Daily truck, seized its shipment of 2,178 kilograms of hasis.
The balls filling the rear part of the vehicle were removed by the police to undergo further investigation and measure the drug.
In addition, during the inspection, it was proven that the fake registration sign of the vehicle did not match the data contained in the furgon's papers, so the arrested person is also being prosecuted for falsification of public documents.
The Bask Regional Police is continuing its investigation, aiming, on the one hand, to arrest the other suspect, who, as already mentioned, fled the highway, and, on the other hand, to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old accused, A. A. J., was transported to the police for the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours the judicial actions began.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested by police in Santa Barbara (California) this weekend for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness said he attempted strange manoeuvres to leave a parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Traffic Administration told People magazine.
A witness said Locklear "pressed the gas to the floor, pushed the engine, tried to leave the parking lot forward and back, and crossed his sunglasses several times in the back."
Not long after, an eyewitness, who at first probably did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also called the police because “he was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralyzed traffic on the highway.
“It seemed confusing,” so the patrols took him to a specialized center for drug and alcohol testing.
A police spokeswoman said the actress was collaborative and alcohol use was almost immediately ruled out. The spokeswoman also said that according to the first impression of the officers, they think she was under the influence of the drug Locklear.
Lockley was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified drug and was taken to the local prison around 7 p.m., where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of a sanatorium in Arizona two months ago, where he was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on IU (United Left) Andalusian Federation to act on Silva's case
Gaspar Llamazares, Secretary-General of the IU and Representative of the United Left, said today that the regional federation of the group will decide on the case of former Youth and Sports Advisor of the Seville Municipality, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after being accused of abusing his position to benefit his family members.
“In these matters, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this matter belongs to the competence of the Andalusian organization,” Llamazares pointed out the procedure that the party should apply to the former member of the Seville city council.
On the other hand, the president of the IU stressed that “transparency” should be kept in mind when detecting any irregularities that may be committed by Silva: “At IU has always been committed to ensuring that such cases are as transparent as possible.”
He added that the training is also part of “a strict code of ethics for civil servants.”
“May’s Blood”, an epic work by Garci
Benito Pérez Galdós's National Episodes was inspired by José Luis Garcia, who recalls the famous anti-French uprising of the Spanish in the May Blood, which, with a budget of 15 million euros, is the largest work of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director tried to illustrate the flow of people and social analysis he always admired in the work of the famous novelist. All this Garci told the crowd of actors today at the film show with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour May Blood will be shown in theaters on Friday, and will later be shown as a mini-series on Telemadrid for more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of the literature of Galdós, realized his childhood dream with this film. All this is due to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the Province of Madrid to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid on May 2. Garci accepted the invitation on the condition that the basis of the story could be given by the National Episodes.
The budget of 15 million euros was fully funded by the Autonomous Province of Madrid and represented a special opportunity for Garci: with an age-old decoration and costume, he featured “the confused Spaniards who mistakenly stood by the wrong leader, as the struggle for independence drove the country into a huge backdrop under the rule of Ferdinand VII,” he said.
However, the director regretted not being able to count on more than doubling the budget for the ghosts of Alatriste or Goya in May's Blood. For this reason, he was forced to miss a few scenes from the script, which, like many other occasions, was recorded with Horacio Valcárcel.
So the director of Re-Start applied to his usual way of working, recording the scenes with the actors with whom he had already begun the trials before shooting. Casting was not because Garci considers it "disgraceful" and because, as he said, "part of the craft of directing is going to the theatre and the cinema to find out what is going on in the industry in which we work."
Several actors of May's Blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not appear in front of his camera for the first time.
Garci, who boasts four Oscar nominations and one Oscar, believes that none of the nominees this year representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy, namely the May Blood, the Seven French Biliard Tables and the eventually selected Blind Sunrise, represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema, “where it should be presented,” he said.
Garci does not count on prizes with this film.
“In the beginning, you think you’re working for the afterlife, then you realize that wealth is the only thing that matters, and in the end you’re happy to have another movie done,” Garci says with 30 years of professional career behind him.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Seville flamenco dancer commemorates a Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in eastern dances.
During her busy life, she fought as a pioneer for women’s equality, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought against wearing a corset that inhibited the freedom of movement of women.
He exploded a dance and aesthetic revolution in war-torn Europe, his life fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she recommended me Tortola, whose personality really impressed me.”
The flamenco dancer said: “Our goal is not to tell your life story, but to capture your spirit.
I think of the flamenco style.
For example, from the "butterfly dance" to the guajira, or from the "serpent dance" to the tango.
“He danced sensibly and others said it was my style,” she says.
The performance is highlighted by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda now singing again after the Open Door at Isabel’s performance; and Matilde Coral, who in this case exceptionally wanted to work with a former student.
Matilde plays the elderly Tórtola, the mature woman.
I’m glad that he said yes to the invitation, and it’s a great honour that he plays in my play.”
In addition, the production includes music directors and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, singers Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the beat El Pájaro, the bracelet Rafa El Viola, and the actor Juanfra Juárez, who "play the constant character that constantly surrounds the real diva with his love."
The play also largely depicts the life of the woman, who lives in London, but also travels to Europe and even goes to distant landscapes at the time, including India, the United States or Italy.
“I wanted to remember him because his personality had a big impact on his age, but nowadays his work is no longer known and even less appreciated,” Bayón says.
The show will begin at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, "The Diary of a Newly Married Poet" will also be published.
The first illustrated edition of A Newly Married Poet's Diary will be presented at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation is part of a series of programs entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government on the occasion of the fiftyth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of both.
Thus, the final chord of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the re-release of the work mentioned, the International Congress held in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winning poet’s memorial house and the wandering exhibition “Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Bright Summer Tree.” The exhibition opened in May this year, passing through several Andalusian provinces and planned to visit New York during the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government has obtained a total of eight hundred copies of the Diary of a Newly Married Poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
America is not so attractive without Paul Newman
“God sometimes creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that.
The quote comes from actress Sally Field who worked with Newman in The Victims of Sensation and reflects the shock and helplessness caused by Newman’s death in the American film industry and across America.
How hard it was to get an Oscar.
He retired in 2007.
He was known to be sick.
Everyone was shocked by his death.
“Sometimes it is impossible to express our feelings, and I have now lost a good friend,” said Robert Redford, “his existence has made my life and this country better.”
No one was afraid that he might be ridiculous or exaggerated.
One of the heroes of cinema and home passed through a dark period shaded by terrorism and the fear of market conditions, the desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When such difficult times go by and many people easily lose their virtues and there are very few people left to look up to, you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, it embodied the Platonic concept of beauty and truth with reality.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and defender of lost and won cases, ranging from a drug foundation set up in memory of his first-born son who died from drug overdose to the creation of his home-made bio-food brand.
It was a real gift to a country that was struggling to go beyond its suicidal nutritional culture.
The overwhelming wave of admiration swept through Hollywood, regardless of nationality and origin.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, said he died with him, not a man, but an era.
Another English, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said his collaboration with Newman was clearly the culmination of his career.
Russell Crowe called the Australian bad boy Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He put the ladder very high for all of us," said George Clooney, who is probably one of the few who are trying to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle today: demanding honesty and serious privacy away from cameras.
It’s not always easy, if at all possible, in the middle of today’s media jungle.
There are people who try, and Paul Newman is an example.
He once divorced, but then lived in a faithful marriage for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, though he would have had many occasions to be unfaithful.
“Why eat hamburgers elsewhere when you’re waiting for baked meat at home?” he joked.
He can be proud in heaven that his daughters on earth are also fans, which is not very common in America.
"None of his characters was as proud as a loyal husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather, and a devout human-friendly."
The Olympics in Madrid
Indeed, many of us dream of having an Olympics in Madrid, and after the 2012 failed, it might be 2016.
But I ask, are we really prepared for it?
Because if we start out from yesterday’s race, I don’t think at all.
It was called a perfect race, but in my view it was the worst of many I’ve ever had.
It was characterized by a bunch of nonsense, and if it had to be evaluated once, and I would be the examiner, the result would clearly be a failure.
Let’s go ahead and start from the beginning.
The insults began with the receipt of the serial number, because therefore it had to come earlier.
This in itself is not a problem, but if you go sooner, at least get it all at once (including the chip, to avoid being in a later row).
Not that happened.
First, only the serial number was given (first nonsense, only to go there sooner) and (after standing in the usual row), how surprisingly, it was only a T-shirt (second nonsense, because I am just XL in size)!
In what world do we live?
Or because of the crisis, have you decided to save on the material and only buy cheaper, smaller shirts?
But no matter what, these things are still dull compared to what happened on the race day.
In addition to having to go there terribly early to pick up the chip, the line-up took 15 minutes from the arrival, and even the backpack had to be dropped.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started and we didn’t give up the backpack yet.When we finally got it, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the more pleasant of the more than 40-minute wait, which was stunned by popular uprisings and stand-off attempts.
I think that by tomorrow we’ll have about 500 people with certain pneumonia, and some, including myself, won’t get our place with our actual time.
If you asked me about the perfect running race, that’t happen to me.
So I think we can continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) reception
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence – not very intelligent – that can perform some basic tasks. For example, you can call a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a vehicle that travels within the company’s territory) based on the information you hear from a conversation.
This “receptor” uses a camera and a shape and face recognition system to recognize how many people are in the room, who they are—in fact, it also records what clothes they are wearing—and hears and understands the key words of their conversations.
You can also group the attendees based on the conversations.
In the presentation video, the receptionist identifies a third person, but knows that she is neither a member of the company with whom she talks nor an employee of the company.
He asks if he has visited someone and assures him that he will rush to help him soon.
All this without the big blue screen.
It is impressive.
This is the music of the future.
Currently, the company has more important tasks, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, a lot of people have rumored that Microsoft has changed its strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and will have fewer accessories.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers run only the necessary programs instead of the many commercial junkyards, the machines would be five times faster.
The Spanish wax was invented, given that Microsoft has added additional features and extras to Windows in every new version so far.
The change of direction returns.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is becoming more and more backward, and the software itself too.
When Google Chrome came out on the web, I joined the theory that Google was taking the first step to becoming a competitor to Windows.
Many people have rightly recognized that a browser is not part of an operating system.
The operating system will always be needed as it is an indispensable element for the dialogue between hardware and software.
You play the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother.
It is so.
It will never disappear, but it must be counted with the "death" of the operating system, not in an absolute, but in a relative sense.
Ballmer’s statement this week supports this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the web browser.
We turn on the computer only to open Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and we spend more time browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
What is the majority of the applications in the system?
Less is sometimes more.
Windows 7 is much smaller than Vista.
Less difficult, less loaded, less complicated.
Microsoft’s goal is to integrate its services on-line and ultimately be an alternative to Google.
This is very important and I’ll give you an example of why.
I took this photo earlier this month at a Microsoft employee salon in Redmond.
A poster on the refrigerator asks them to use the company’s browser. – “Your browser is our future.”
In 2006, an independent survey found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the internet.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of 2010.
Microsoft is likely to try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, mobile phones are increasingly functioning as computers.
But sliding, considering that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely ruin their business.
The Fabulous Marcel
It was worn by Pablo Picasso in the Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio in the Bloody Diamond of Edward Zwick, and Al Pacino in the Cross of Francis Ford Coppola, and it is also one of the basic clothes of the crazy gay shopping audience.
And if we are already on the list of the specialties, we can even recall the peaceful figure of the wanderly circus catch-up lifter.
But what are we talking about?Nothing more than a typically tight and fingerless men's cotton t-shirt.
That is, about the "tank", as the English are called, but with le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles no one of his rivals can compete.
First of all, because of its elegant name - although it is referred to only as "Marcel" among friends - which is due to the sport, it is said that it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel also stands out among its competitors because of its excellent cotton material, unisex style, unique logo and the small (nearly recognizable) Belgian flag.
But the Belgian company does not only manufacture tanks.
Sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere sandals, wool trousers, seafarers, baby clothes, mini-sorts – and we could even name them – are all among the products of the company.
And they all belong to the category of comfortable underwear,
It is also important to use them as underwear.
They are too good.
“I want to be a young mother, no matter who’s going to be my father.”
He is very similar to his brother, but at the same time managed to realize himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
Currently, the Cruz Sisters want to take on a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, being a model means much more than just giving some beautiful girls their name to something.
He was present at the promotion of the Mango company’s new Paris headquarters, as well as the delivery of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
It brings warmth and gentleness.
What are you doing in Paris?
We are presenting Mango’s new autumn-winter collection, which we designed with my brother Penélope. In addition, we will participate in the announcement of the second competition for the ‘Mango Fashion Awards’ and a gala dinner in honour of Valentino at the Opera.
A fairly dense day, it’s true, but very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango, where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the movies of the 50s and 60s; we’ve taken a lot of things from there.
And then, I often walk around the city and watch women dress, how they vary and choose their clothes – it’s one of my favourite spending time.
You also work as a dancer, actress and fashion designer. You are a versatile woman, right?
I think so, but these three things are connected because they have a lot in common.
As a child, I was interested in clothes, I was looking forward to going to my grandmother and swimming in my aunt’s wardrobe.
Well, it was in Canaan, almost matched with an amusement park.
As a dancer, I always tried to look after my clothes.
You know, we dancers love to come up with our own style for classes and tests so that we can have fun looking in the mirror.
And in the role of an actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is related to everything, and I have all my respect for the designers and their expertise.
Have you recently celebrated your 30th birthday?
No to No!
I feel better than ever, I love my 30s.
I think women are really worth it now, they are already experienced enough and make fewer mistakes in life.
My biological clock is not worried.
Since I was a child, I have been doing what I want to do, and it gives me great inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because I was born to be a woman, and I really want to be a young mother, and I don’t want to miss that.
As for the future father, it doesn’t matter who he is.
I want to raise my child in love and happiness.
Let’s say a few words about the cinema.You also made several films last year that have not yet been shown.
Yes, and I can’t wait to come out.
I, who started in the theater, am very impatient and anxious, I want everything right away, but of course I know it’s impossible.
I look forward to being introduced to The Last Hour and the search for the tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you say to them...
A few days ago, I met with Naomi Campbell.
No, this is not true...
I didn’t go on the road as a model.
I’ve known Naomi Campbell for a long time and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London, which she organized for her own organization, Women for a Better World. I chose two of her own Mango collections. The dresses presented were auctioned and the money raised was donated to Naomi’s NGO.
People don’t even know how kind Naomi is.
I know so much about it, and I can assure you that half of it is not true.
I always look at the good side of my work.
He asked me to go to the fashion show for a noble cause, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I would.
If the fate of women in the third world is at stake, I don’t know the impossible.
Recurring drunk drivers will be obliged to install the "Alcolock"
After three violations due to drunk driving, the Ministry of the Interior would order the driver to install a mechanism that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver is drunk or does not blow into the mechanism.
The proposal was submitted in June and is currently being dealt with by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, according to which the pilot project will last a year.
Since the project aims to re-enter traffic, the driver will also have to take a repetitive course on transport education.
In addition to the General Prosecutor’s Office for Traffic Safety, the General Directorate for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation for Automotive Safety Technology Institute (FITSA) are also involved in the experiment.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of drivers who have been arrested several times for drunk driving are back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock because the system connected to the vehicle determines the level of alcohol in the inhaled air. If it is higher than permitted, or if the driver has not inhaled the device at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of more than 1,000 euros would be borne by the infringer.
A 2007 U.S. study showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, this rule is estimated to save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure focuses on violations for two reasons: on the one hand, it makes it easier to prevent them from becoming a crime.
On the other hand, it is easier to implement because the implementation of the legal reform takes place as usual, while the necessary criminal reform would require an amendment to the basic law.
The device is not yet commercially available on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in some industrial and utility vehicles in a pilot mode.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party, which, on the French model, calls for the system to be installed in school buses.
In closed shoes
At 17:40 a.m., the Spanish air force’s Prince of Asturias aircraft landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was already sinking, but it was still so hot that we could only use our hands as an eye shutter to see the royal party coming out of the plane.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other prestigious personalities.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish prince couple was coming to the city for an official visit.
Well, well, there will be no airport transfers for a long time today...The woman is here or something like that...
“No, not sir, the lady is Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
Yes or so...
But the Mexican press knows everything about the Prince of Asturias and the significance of their visit.
Many are waiting on the red carpet of the airport hangar, a cordon of 27 marines who serve to protect the dignities.
The prince appears, smiling, dressed in the sea blue, and then the princess, with her long hair caught by the wind, dressed in restrained clothes, but not in the usual, finger-looking shoes—maybe they were warned that Mexico City was threatened by a storm.
They stop for a moment and smile to the cameras, then enter the room where the official reception will take place.
At the door of their hotel, one of the city’s four largest hotels, they are awaited by a spokesperson for the Mexican television.
The most valuable prize
The best place in the world to pass a fashion award is undoubtedly Paris, and one of the most sophisticated and cool fashion designers living today is undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second competition for the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to promote the international awareness of young talents in the fashion industry.
The prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first competition, saw her own design clothes in the Mango exhibition under Haussmann Boulevard in Paris, and shed tears from emotion.
By the way, it is the company’s second largest shop in Europe and recently opened on 1335 square meters.
The biggest store is in London.
In the midst of the great event and the thanks to Valentine for the chairmanship of the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most delightful Chagalok, the presidential table prepared by the gala dinner Mango was even more spectacular.
Nati, who came with a heavy heart and sadness due to her brother’s recent death, wore a piece of the Company and some of ELAH’s breathtaking ornaments. Handled with her son, Luis, almost two meters tall, she accompanied Valentine to the main dinner table arranged in his honor.
Andik, the owner and host of the Mango, entertained the guests. Together with Baron Rothchil, they were so knightly that they ended up without a suit as they both gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in her own designed pants and shirts, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. During her nightly visit to the opera, Gaya Toledo was so enthusiastic about her company in the ballet hall that, reminding of the old days, she sat down at one of the bars and improvised a grand plie.
Inés Sastre did not attend the palace visit, but before that he posted a few photos of his son on his mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy Oliver Martinez – he was also two meters tall and riding a motorcycle – and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental hotel in Paris.
Under the starry sky of Paris.
C’est la vie.

Another good news is that you can find them all in one book, which will arrive in bookstores on September 30th to bring your peace of mind with you.
It’s almost tormenting to ring the clock at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to think of how accelerated life is forced on a daily basis in today’s world.
The name of the office is tension and the name of the computer is back pain.
Stress is the disease of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two ways to overcome daily exhaustion and overcome workplace problems.
No, this number is exactly 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book so that everyone can find the solution that best suits them and can be tailored to their free moments.

In addition, it also offers other ideas that help you relax, such as tips on getting closer to nature or how to prepare 100% natural foods.
If your adrenaline levels are already too low to refresh your body and stress has become a central problem in your life, it’s time to sit back in your chair, relax and just focus on reading.
Those who talk in their dreams
Some children talk at night.
I don’t think of those who wake up and tell them what happened to them that day, but of those who talk while they are asleep.
The phenomenon may seem frightening at first, but in reality it is completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquism.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Some of them said they talked at night.
In terms of frequency, it can be completely rapsodic (for example, it occurs only once in a disease accompanied by a high fever) or more regular (once a day, once a week or once a month), and usually the next day the child remembers nothing.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single triggering cause.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nighttime waking, nighttime sleeping (enuresis nocturna) or sleeping, but this is not legal.
As mentioned above, it can be accompanied by a condition associated with high fever, or even a stressful situation or an increased state of excitement.
So far, it has been studied very little.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It can be quiet, calm, consist of unrelated words, murmuring, but contrary to all this, it can also occur in the form of screaming, crying, or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult a specialist.The examination can reveal whether there is a problem that causes great anxiety in the background and thus can offer a solution.
As mentioned above, it is a benign phenomenon and therefore cannot be cured unless it is accompanied by other treatable forms of sleep disorder (such as insomnia or a stressful situation).
However, there are a few things you can do, and here are some precautions:
Make sure the child remains calm before going to bed.
Choose reassuring toys and avoid watching scary or more aggressive TV shows or series.
Children who are prone to nervousness or have difficulty relaxing are taught some relaxation methods to help them find inner peace.
This will help the child to sleep more calmly.
When we start talking while we are asleep, we try to stay calm.
Remember, this is harmless for the child, and the next day they will not remember anything.
Useful Advice
Do not wake the child.
It would be unnecessary because the child is unconscious, but would get out of sleep.
Despite speaking, he actually continues to sleep and rest.
Remember, if the phenomenon is accompanied by severe anxiety several times, it is advisable to consult a specialist or find out what triggers a high degree of anxiety in the child.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarest case), don’t start asking questions to learn anything from him.
It would be unnecessary, because while sleeping, he is not conscious enough to gather his thoughts.
On the other hand, you only hear the speech, but you do not see the dreams associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what you hear and the possible conclusions.
Never tell your child that you can ask them about their secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
This caused great anxiety.
So the main thing is not to worry, as it’s just a few minutes of harmless episodes.
Finally to the Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, the Illhaeusern team finally took a new momentum and won again on the home track.
Although it was not a tough match, the yellow-black were put into a position several times, which they could eventually win by using one.
The pace of the match was not too tight because the attackers had difficulty finding the right rhythm.
The first shot to the gate was attempted by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the distant ball just touched the upper corner of the gateway. Then the Illhaeusern prevailed and the shots followed: Fonderflick attempted a distant shot, then Hirn's shot landed over the gate. Romain spiccel, and Diebold also attempted a distant attempt to shake Dannemarie's defense.
On the other side, the players gathered into a block to defend themselves in the midfield, and only the ever-moving Riahi was placed in the shooting position.
The beginning of the second half was decisive: first Riahi and Temporale were placed on the side of Dannemarie. Immediately afterwards the first goal was achieved: after Diebold's first shot, the ball was won by the Marais of Illhaeuserni with an excellent position and then delivered to the goal (53 minutes).
However, the Illhausern goalkeeper could not enjoy the glory for a long time: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the pitch, so his teammates had to continue the fight in disadvantage.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, could not take advantage: they did not cause much trouble to the home team, who just pulled back a little bit to strengthen their defense. Only the last seconds retained some excitement when, after a heavy hit, the ball came very close to the goal.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a look at Brittany.
On Monday, a demonstration held by fishermen paralyzed traffic in several Breton and Normandy ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with representatives of the protesters.
The latter promised to welcome the president in a "constructive spirit" and expressed hope that Sarkozy would come with "concrete proposals".
The presidential visit just coincides with the meeting of the “crisis committee” set up by Breton fishermen with the aim of initiating action against the rising price of gasoline as the price of oil exceeded the record average price of 1.14 euros per liter.
President David Martinon, a spokesman for the Republic, said the president "will discuss with the fishermen how to help companies regain competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers."
Fishermen are looking forward to the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning in Morbihan and Calvados counties, traffic-limiting demonstrations were held, causing 10 kilometers of congestion.
Traffic from the yacht port of Quiberon was also paralyzed, but roads to Belle-île were not closed.
Trails were placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, sailors testified to their determination.At dawn, tires and pallets were set on fire in front of fuel warehouses in the ports of Brest, while protests were held in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in the Atlantic coast and other ports of La Manche. In Sables d'Olonne, Vendée County, for example, fishermen did not board, while in Le Havre, about twenty ships obstructed the traffic of commercial vessels.
Fishermen from La Turballe and Le Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique County overnight lifted the blockade of the massive Total oil refinery operating in Donges.
The boulogne-sur-mer fishermen have decided to wait until the ministry’s meeting on Wednesday to decide on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is due to decide on the next step and its participation at a meeting scheduled in the French Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris on Tuesday.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Commission because the committee has not supported their efforts.
“The strike continues” because “fishermen do not give up on their demands” and “do not want to travel to Paris,” said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Commission.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently pay around 50 cents per liter, but they believe that operating a vessel would only become profitable if the price of diesel dropped below 0.30 euros per liter.
The Great Paul Newman
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid has died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have also paid tribute to actor Paul Newman who passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer does not change its 2008 shipment plans
Despite the global economic crisis, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, has planned to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, the company’s president.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturing company relies heavily on the Chinese market, especially with its 30-120-seat aircraft.
Embraer has delivered a total of 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG to sell more than 15% of its assets
American International Group, an insurance company recovered by U.S. financial authorities, plans to sell more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay its $85 billion in advance, the Dominican issue of the Financial Times.
In addition to its international life insurance and U.S. pension insurance operations, AIG would cut off most of its other, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the case.
According to the Times, AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday night to examine sales opportunities.
AIG did not confirm this information.
The assets AIG intends to sell include the company’s aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings, and its real estate portfolio and private capital investments, the Times adds.
However, a final decision on the sale has not yet been made.
AIG needs to quickly obtain liquid assets to repay the $85 billion loan approved by the U.S. government, taking the risk of losing up to 80% of its capital and equally losing shareholders.
Paris Historique Study of the Historic Morning Meeting Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic downturn on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson’s bank rescue plan.The Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (an unprecedented drop of 800 points) and the Nasdaq fell by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to close at 10.365.45.
The index’s largest ever decline (684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, when trading resumed after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
Based primarily on technology securities, the Nasdaq closed at 1,983,73 points with a decline of 199,61 points, while the Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index fell by 8,81% (or 106,85 points) to 1,106,55 points according to the official closing data.
The Wall Street stock market had already weakened at the opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected a bank rescue plan to restore market balance, it began to fly deeper.
MEPs voted 228 “no” to 205 “yes” to refuse to provide funds requested by Finance Minister Henry Paulson.
The plan was rejected by two-thirds of Republicans.
“From this, the market has filtered out bad signals as it seems that Congress is unable to approve a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza, an analyst at FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was expecting this plan," he added, and expressed concern that if such a plan were adopted a few days later, it would be "too late."
“If the plan is really deadly, then the Fed and other central banks will be in charge of dealing with the crisis and lending conditions will continue to be tightened,” said Brian Bethune, senior economist at Global Insight.
To further enhance the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: “Every day, more and more financial institutions go bankrupt” in the United States.
Following Friday’s bankruptcy of Washington Mutual, authorities have arranged for Wachovia’s banking business to be acquired by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, requiring emergency measures to rescue banks in the UK, the Benelux states, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market has developed "not only a crisis in the United States, but a global one," adds an analyst at FTN Financial.
The bond market has revived significantly.
The 10-year government bond yield fell from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday evening, while the 30-year-old fell from 4.357% to 4.161% on the previous day.
Obama wins first television duel
The first debate between the two U.S. presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would win the duel.
Not surprisingly, both Republican and Democrat campaign leaders claimed the victory in a television duel that was watched by a third of U.S. households.
Political analyst David Gergen said that although McCain’s action was respectable, it didn’t prove “impressive enough” to stop his decline in popularity, according to polls conducted five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate is better in the fight: the results of the poll published on Saturday show that Obama is five points ahead of McCain (44% and 49% respectively).
Among the most counting, yet indecisive voters, 39 percent say Obama will win, while 25 percent expect McCain to win, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his party partner Joseph Biden’s promising performance on Thursday.Biden is preparing for his first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned this weekend: “It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
You have good intuitions.”
McCain, in his 70s, never fails to put his own undeniably vast foreign policy experience at the forefront, but he emphasizes his opponent’s “naivety” in these issues, which were central to their first personal encounter.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” the attack was repeated.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary for the presidency,” McCain said.
This is the main attack interface, which has also been exploited by Republican TV ads running since yesterday.
Obama said he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he spoke clearly and accurately.
He stressed his ability to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still doesn’t understand, but Obama already does,” a Democratic advertisement broadcast over the weekend tells the Republican leader that he has not yet assessed the impact of the crisis on the American “street people.”
“Over the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama told 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina for the election.
Even the words “middle class” or “workers” did not come out of his mouth.The chaotic situation in the financial world is undoubtedly favorable to Obama, whom Americans consider to be the most suitable to save the economy on the brink of collapse.
"The next seven may prove to be a turning point," said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democrat Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton administration, said Obama had "excellent instincts in the field of economy" as Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is “the final verdict over the eight-year bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain.”
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that he will be able to reduce the tax burden of 95 percent of Americans despite stock market volatility, adding that his primary goals include achieving the country’s potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources and developing a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both presidential candidates, however, cautiously bypassed questions related to the $700 billion ($470 billion) bank rescue plan: the highly unpopular plan was passed by Congress last night.
Minsk: “Have you noticed that there was an election here?”
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday night in the Belarusian capital’s main square to reject the expected results of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday after the closure of polling stations, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in Minsk to protest against the falsification of election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, many young people have protested against President Alexander Lukashenko with the words: "Mr. Dictator, give up!"
Some admit that they haven’t even gone to vote: “Why should I go? so they do what they want with my vote!” says one young man.
Demonstrators do not believe that the regime, which has tried to show up in front of foreign observers in order to build ties with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic system change.
If the elections were deemed clean by observers, sanctions against the country could be lifted, refusing visas to 40 Belarusian leaders and freezing some bank accounts.
The opposition said the elections were not clear.
“We were kept away from the election committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count,” said Yuri Potyemkin, a spokesman for the highly heterogeneous United Democratic Forces coalition of the twelve parties.
"The changes were only nominal," said Alexander Milinkievich, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is who counts the votes, and in our case this is the executive power.
If opposition delegates enter parliament, it means that they have been appointed, not elected.
But getting into parliament allows them to get a seat on television, meet in the regions of the country and submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore take a stand in the political life, because "it is necessary to initiate a dialogue with the European Union."
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in a crisis and we are unable to regenerate, we risk falling under the control of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the election process, will accept the outcome of the vote as valid.
They stress that the participation rate seems too high, and the widespread organization of the preliminary vote (which in Minsk was attended by 26% of the voters) gave any possibility for manipulation.
“Have you noticed that an election was held here?” asks Social Democratic leader Aleksandr Kozulin, who was released in August this year as the second and last to be released from the prison where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one abstained in the polling stations.
There will be a maximum of five opposition members in the parliament, the ones that are most suitable for the leadership.
In the middle of the night, the silence of the night fell again.
And on television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Committee are delighted to succeed.
Blood is safe again.
President Dr. Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate because Héma-Québec has now become one of the safest and most effective blood donor companies in the world.
Most importantly, he managed to regain people’s confidence, which was severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserve managed by the Canadian Red Cross blood supply service was infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general uproar, in February 1994, the Government of Canada, led by Judge Horace Krever, launched an official investigation aimed at finding out the circumstances that led to the tragedy and making suggestions to avoid future similar cases.
While Judge Krever delayed in submitting his report, some provinces set up their own committees aimed at designing a new blood treatment system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
The Gélineau and Krever reports resulted in the establishment of two blood services in Canada: one for Héma-Québec, which serves Québec, and the other for all other provinces and territories.
“When Héma-Québec started operations in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in Québec’s blood supply system,” Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was desperate.
“But in the years that followed, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field, we were able to regain people’s confidence.” Decary is proud to declare that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Québec’s population had already trusted Héma-Québec.
Dr. Decary, however, does not forget that “confidence is an extremely fragile thing.”
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
During this period, a number of cases have been discovered in Europe where people have been infected by a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the doctor, who has been in charge of the company since its founding in 1998.
“We didn’t know if this disease spread through blood.
Therefore, we relyed on one of the most important recommendations in the Krever and Gélineau reports. According to this, if we are uncertain about this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, then we should apply exclusive measures. In this case, we were talking about the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes brain damage, so inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who have spent more than a month in the UK since 1980.
A few years ago, it was established without any doubt that the disease also spreads through blood.
This case convinced us that it makes sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that allows for a much more sensitive diagnosis of the HIV virus. This is a nucleic acid test (NAT), which can detect the virus itself directly in the blood of blood donors, rather than the antibodies formed against the virus, on which the previously used tests were built.
With the help of the NAT test, we were able to shorten the window period from the infection to the detection of the virus in the blood using our technical tools, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This significantly reduced the risk of blood donors infecting the blood supply unknowingly and that this could not be detected.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of getting blood from a person infected with HIV is 12 million per one.
In other words, this means we should distribute 12 million blood products until someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products every year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and someone to become infected with the HIV virus through a blood product.
I think that today anyone can readily accept or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health, says the number one leader of Héma-Québec.
“The challenge for the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
You can never know what new pathogens will enter the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, gets into the blood by insect bites.
Therefore, we must be constantly on the brink,” continued Dr. Décary, then stressing that in addition to the emergency reserves, Héma-Québec must provide sufficient permanent reserves.
With the ageing of the population, the demands also increase.
As anti-cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need replacement of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has an impact on the blood donor population, with only 3% of Québec’s population being eligible for blood donation on the net.
However, any healthy person, at least 18 years of age, who meets the fitness conditions can donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of candidates do not accept blood because they are infected with, for example, AIDS or malaria, and those who have been to a country where malaria is devastating are not eligible to donate blood for a year.
“With this 3% we have enough reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It is very rare to run out of stock.
The number of blood donors, on the other hand, must be increased as existing ones get older, because they can no longer donate blood after a while.
However, it is very difficult to persuade people to donate blood, but it is even harder to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
In today’s rushing world, one has barely an hour to go out to donate blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeball tissue and skin tissue, which is almost exclusively used for people with severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen and then placed at Héma-Québec, which also manages Québec’s only public stem cell bank.
Formerly treated only as medical waste, the umbilical cord can extract blood that is rich in stem cells, thus enabling the treatment of serious diseases (such as leukemia).
“A few weeks ago we celebrated the introduction of the thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood in our bank and we are planning to take more than a thousand new samples each year.
We’ll probably start offering them for organ transplants by the beginning of next year,” said Dr. Décary, who said the umbilical cord blood collection program is very popular today.
“Many mothers are saddened that they don’t have the opportunity to do so” – this is true because Héma-Québec is not able to make this complex and expensive program available in every hospital in Québec.
Football – The Impact
Montreal Impact yesterday defeated Seattle Sounder by 3:1 on the USL-1 draw and entered the final with a combined score of 4:3 this was the second and decisive match of the quarter-finals, which took place at Saputo Stadium.
The final goal was scored by Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half went without a goal, in the second half, the two midfielder of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, also found in the opponent's net.
Only Roger Levesque from the Sounders managed to bypass Matt Jordan.
Remember, in Friday’s first match, Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat from the Starfire Complex in Tukwil, Seattle’s suburb.
Impact will play with Vancouver Whitecaps in the final.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, which defeated Whitecaps 3:1 in the first match, won 4:3 but Whitecaps entered the final with a combined score of 5:4 .
The Impact are expected to meet with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches will be clarified today.
The winning goal of Kovalev
Canadiens' favorite trio is preparing for the next season.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led great attacks and eventually the Canadiens won against the Florida Panthers in a 3:2 ratio from penalty shots last night at Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the meeting, scored a goal. Plekanec scored two and Kovalev scored a goal-pass, which was the fourth victory of the team’s six preparatory matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian player warns.
“I need another game to get in good shape.”
“He tried to get too much out of himself in the first quarter,” said Guy Carbonneau.
“I think he was pleased with the outcome of the match.
He received a huge applause.”
Northern aspirations of Charest
The government does not rule out that the elections will begin this year.
Just as the Liberal Party assembly was over, Jean Charest had already traveled to Jean-Talon in Québec yesterday, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left) is fighting to win today’s interim elections.
“Cut back our last great northern border”: this ambitious long-term goal was outlined by Jean Charest at yesterday’s Liberal Party meeting in Levis, Québec. The speech was also enriched with visual elements, while the president sought to focus on the essence.
During his performance, a series of images like "Moulin à images" were projected behind him.
On the three giant projectors, impressive images followed each other: water-power barricades, mining, Quebec on Google Maps, maps...
These tools are used during election periods.
The prime minister, however, refused to guarantee at the press conference that the election would not begin this autumn, although he added that his timetable was very tight.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's "vision" for the future of Quebec, embodied in a "new economic area", which includes a labor agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and several agreements planned with Ontario.
Recently, opening up to the North (i.e. the northern area starting at 49° latitude) has been frequently included in the Prime Minister’s speeches, but he has never held a lecture on this subject.
The president, however, has only explained why he considers the North a “treasure mine full of tremendous potential”, but has not spoken about the time factor, the amount of investment, or the specific priority order for future projects.
It highlighted only a few development opportunities: water power plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further stimulated by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
There is nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds in the north,” Charest said.
This area, which is "two times the size of France", "is our territory, the territory of Quebec.
It is not only in us, it is in us,” the president repeated, stressing that he intended to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that the development of Quebec was largely determined by its relationship with the North: the gold fever in Abitibi, the design work in Quebec, the Bay of James...
“This is ours, our future!” he added after taking a stage break and staring at the huge map behind his back.
The north, which covers 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes part of the Labrador, which Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at a news conference.
“This is a historic resolution that has been ratified by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been reached for a long time, and if an opportunity arises, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, "in light of climate change, we must rethink our view on the North," he said, referring to the northwestern passage that opens every year due to the melting of Arctic ice.
In this new geopolitical environment, the occupation of the territory is an important task.
And what about the indigenous people of the area, the Indians and the Eskimo?
The prime minister said the Quebec government is paying special attention to them and that the plan will benefit them a lot, especially young people.
Two ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was a delegate from Parti Québécois in Ungava) have already started consultations with about thirty local communities.
An inter-ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister of Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role, has also started its work.
The prime minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit" where they "create a common vision".
The development of the North would be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, systematic and at the same time environmentally friendly,” he said.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as consistent with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from challenges.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend that began with a large cocktail party on Friday to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s election as party chairman.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes that the Beauharnois power plant be renamed Adélard-Godbout.
"The politicians of our party, including Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, Lesage, who implemented the Silent Revolution and the nationwide expansion of hydropower plants, or Bourassa, known as the father of the Bay of James, all knew how to forge the future," Charest said.
At the press conference, he also quoted another, true, conservative work, namely the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, the prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Regarding the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower barrier plan, President Charest stressed that the commissioning is planned for 2012.
“Let it stay between us, but I plan to be there,” he told his followers, receiving his statement with loud applause.
The prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
However, he stressed that the calendar is already full, as he has taken on tasks at the federal council meeting in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The party assembly held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to express nationalist resolutions, which were approved almost without thought.
They would also like Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members would have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, was skeptical of the main points of the Northern Plan.
The leader of the Coastal Québécois, Paulina Marois, resumed the North Québec development policy introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that came to power in 2003 rejected this policy.
If they had not done so, “we would have gone much further today,” said Marois, in agreement with Ms. Françoise Mercure, who was nominated for the vote in Jean-Talon today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government’s approval of the Northern Plan.
"But we want it not to be a mere play," said Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who has returned from his freedom today.
A Lost Country - A Lost Country
Vic Toews, the Harper Cabinet minister (by the way, “Justice” minister) last summer took the courage to call Louise Arbourt a “shame” for Canada.
To humiliate a woman who has fought unceasingly for truth and deserves all our admiration – that says a lot about the people around the prime minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
This is our government, which is the only Western country concerned that has not brought home its own citizens from the Guantanamo concentration camp.
This is the government that has absolutely ignored the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of the crimes he was accused of.
This is the only government that, despite Canada’s signing of the Geneva Convention, has refused its promise and has allowed a child soldier to ski under inhumane conditions.
The only government that makes a doll theater of justice while investigating the guilt of an accused.
Remember, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are also demanding Omar Khadr’s deportation to Canada in order to receive a fair trial in Canada.
And our government is blind to torture: it does not care that a young adult has already been spiritually destroyed, and that many years of torture have probably sealed his fate for a lifetime.
Although we are not yet aware of this, we are currently undergoing the crippling destruction of our rights, freedoms and democracy. "Democracy": Harper continues to pronounce this word, which sounds like an empty word from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: they can arbitrarily beat, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen according to the favour of a leader of a government that was so far a minority (and what will come after October 14...?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found in a party that glorifies virtue, law and order. They do not see that this government is undermining the values to which our country owes its reputation and dignity.
Dear Mr. Toews, the shame is rather this - do not look elsewhere.
Orwell's Speech by Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue of Le Devoir, a letter from Patrick J. Garver, deputy president and chief executive of the Barrick Gold mine in Canada, appeared.
Following Orwell’s explanation, Garver claims that the world’s largest gold producer has filed a $6 million defamatory lawsuit against three authors and a small money publishing company in order to initiate a so-called “public debate.”
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decisions – in defamatory cases – are not based on truth but on the law.
Not surprisingly, Garver was deeply silent about this fundamental difference.
For Barrick Gold, would it really be the best way for a public debate to destroy anyone whose views are contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada have to spend substantial sums of money defending and fighting in an unequal struggle where on the other side stands an army of lawyers supported by the almost inexhaustible resources of the mining industry.
In such an unequal struggle, by the way, they often use the tactic of destroying the defendant and making a friendly settlement, by which they not only silence the opposites, but even frighten those who would try to deal with the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views in front of the public.
While many other countries where Barrick Gold operates do this differently, in Canada, the parties to the dispute usually don’t hit each other with their sticks, but say their thoughts.
It would therefore have been enough for the mine to open its books and dossiers and prepare for a real debate in the press, in the media, in publications, paying for independent research teams to shed light on the issue.
But it seems that Barrick Gold has no confidence in the public opinion, and with one move it is shifting aside petitions and letters written to protect the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver explain how he could initiate a “public” debate while ignoring the opinion of this public?
In the vice president’s mind, this word probably only refers to the high-paying lawyers, not the total population of Canada: the meaning of the term is thus much narrowed.
In a democratic country, even those who despise others are entitled to freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, does not understand – or does not want to understand – that Noir Canada’s authors and publishers are mostly supported by the public because they condemn the mine’s rude behavior.
The public is willing to listen to Barrick and make a judgment, but it would do so on civilized grounds, rather than by a trial of silence for many. (In connection with the term "public debate," by the way, Barrick Gold has recently written to the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
Beyond Garver’s surreal arguments, the Barrick Gold Procedure is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of every democratic society.
As a whole, the procedure denies the right to cite credible sources, something to argue about the facts and their interpretation, which are the basis of intellectual activities.
If, in a country like Canada, it is only possible to study and discuss subjects under the burden of litigation that do not please the wealthy companies of today’s world, then who will take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, you could do so according to the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to answer.
In our university community, we have been able to deal with disputes, disagreements and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold’s reckless behavior shows that, contrary to what he claims, he is unwilling to conduct an open debate.
This is a loss for both the university world and the institution of Canadian public debate.It is time for governments to implement measures to limit legal proceedings initiated for such abuses.
Wall Street bailout: Republicans and Democrats agree
The Bush administration and Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress finally reached an agreement on the economic bailout, the largest such plan since the Great World Economic Crisis in the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan, aimed at curbing the Wall Street financial crisis, has yet to be approved by the two houses of Congress.
Key points of the plan are: greater control of implementation by the MEPs; new mechanisms to ensure reimbursement of allocated public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses seized due to non-payment; access to the salary of managers of companies receiving aid.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican MP Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes before midnight yesterday after the two-day marathon trial ended.
“We’ve made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets,” said Henry Paulson, a spokesman for the Bush administration.
"We have done everything to save the real economy and the American people from the current crisis that has hit Wall Street," he said.
"The most important aspect is that if we don't do this, there will be enormous shock, chaos and confusion in the everyday lives of Americans," said Republican MP Judd Gregg.
The negotiations have been accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have a detrimental impact on investors’ mood.
The deal was signed until the opening of the stock market this morning.
The two presidential candidates, who joined the negotiations late, expressed their willingness to reach an agreement, but expressed their disappointment that the situation has worsened until the end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama attributed to himself the expansion of the deal with elements such as provisions relating to preserving home ownership or paying executives of state-aided companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take some extraordinary steps because of the irresponsibility of others, it’s not very welcome.
But these steps are necessary,” he said in an American television show.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied, "I would like to know the details, but I hope it is."
“What I’ve read broadly shows that it’s something that we all have to digest and through which we can move forward.
The possibility of not doing anything is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan would use taxpayers’ money to buy suspicious claims from U.S. financial institutions, some of their risky, non-selling assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis triggered by the outbreak of the real estate boom, which first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgages), then spread to other (commercial) debt-creating securities, and eventually led to the freezing of liquid funds and the uproar of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was rejected by a group of Republican MPs last week.
We seem to have been able to get out of this impasse since the Democrats agreed that certain “toxic” assets in difficult companies should be secured by the government rather than purchased.
To ensure that all members of Congress are satisfied, the plan also included a provision that if the government had to bear losses under the program for five years, it could impose new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion fee would first be paid, followed by another $100 billion if the president considers it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion will have to be approved by Congress.
In exchange for the aid, Washington will acquire shares in the subsidized companies, which will allow it to receive dividends from the profits and sell them after the crisis has eased.
The federal government will have the option to delay the seizure of properties to cover the mortgages covered by the plan.
The bill is expected to be approved by the House of Representatives today and by the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still unlikely that the plan will be approved.
There have been repeated statements against the plan, both among Republicans and Democrats.
“It’s very clear that Washington won’t hear your voice,” said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House’s financial committee.
“We have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
There is no way to benefit taxpayers.”
Brad Sherman, a Democrat who leads a small congressional group called the “sceptical faction,” shows things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred outstanding economists, including three Nobel Prize-winning scientists, wrote to us asking Congress not to rush and consider carefully which path to take," Sherman said.
In Europe, at the same moment, it was again understood that this is a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalize part of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy its competitor on the verge of bankruptcy after losing €2.9 billion ($2.9 billion) as a result of the US secondary mortgage crisis.
With 85,000 employees, Fortis is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and one of the 10 largest insurance companies.
“This is not wasted money,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
In exchange, we get voting rights and influence in the bank.
That’s exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation is unpromising.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seems to be preparing to nationalize another bank, which has been crushed by the financial crisis.
According to the British media, the government would take over all of the ongoing loans to the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which real estate loans amounted to £41 billion ($75.5 billion).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will acquire the bank’s subsidiaries and customer base.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Goodbye to the Actor's Stage
His beautiful blue eyes were, according to some, his main hit card, while others said it was his main weakness.
Has an American actress ever got rid of a narcissistic mirror?
Yes, and not even.
Through his shamefulness, sensitivity and innate talent, he also stood away from the harp style, which is the creature of the true great monsters of the art world.
What an enormous path he has taken!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at the age of 83 in Connecticut on Friday, one of the last icons of the American cinema boom.
He was a less monumental individual than Brando, to whom he resembled, and who for a long time had been counted as his rival on the movie stage. In his roles he was more restrained and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also advocated freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
Often out of the mixture of blood comes extraordinary children.
Newman was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
The European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic figures of the American Dream.
He did not think too much about himself, which only increased his merits.
He was embodied in an ideal of “self-made man” and a country that admired the ideal of a warrior broken in the Pacific War. In the early 1950s, he studied drama at Yale University and then at the Actor’s Studios in New York, before he entered the world of theatre, television and shortly thereafter cinema.
In addition to being a civil rights champion, he took second place in the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979 as a racer, and was considered a sex symbol, although he had been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we can never know what the shadows of this mysterious, closed-down, dedicated actor’s life were, who hated the glamour of the show business.
He was an honest man in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked film fans: in his major roles we can only see on the black screen of memories.
Looking back at his life, it is the seventh American art that has been changing for more than fifty years.
Our memories are mixed between the muddy cowboy "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Puppy" (1969) and the young man cooled away from his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), whose role we saw in Tennessee Williams' adaptation of "The Cat on the Hot Roof" in 1958.
Recent Times (1990) reminds us of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who faces an old age when his marriage has failed to fulfill his hopes.
Paul Newman has seen many other faces in his films.
Robert Wise played an unforgettable role in his film "Somebody Up There" as the stormy criminal-boxer Rocky Graziano. This role originally intended for James Dean - and taken over after his death - began Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant film The Big Bang, which won the Oscar for best film in 1973.
In his genius film "The Scindler" (1961), Robert Rossen played an upset, avenging billiard player and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's film "The Color of Money" for which he won only one Oscar in 1987 out of nine nominations.
Changing times, but always the same face: it was him.
It has always been so.
The period of his career was marked by changes of ages.
The younger men are mostly known for George Roy Hill’s cult film “Ice Breakers” (1977), where he plays Reggie Dunlop, a hockey team coach who works with unconventional methods.
He appeared in "The Big Jump" by the Coen Brothers in 1994.
Sam Mendes made his last appearance as an Irish mafia leader in the 2003 film The Way of Judgment.
Unlike many of the movie legends who left the scene relatively soon, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its glamour, luxury, and hypocrisy.
French film director Bertrand Tavernier did not regard it as a "living refutation of sub-playing" without any humor: he thought his play was too powerful.
The profession, however, was not always gracious with the beautiful Paul Newman, whose long-time film roles just fell into his arms.
Nevertheless, less often he played young and successful characters: rather he played figures from the outskirts of society - nervous, alcoholic, malicious or hopeless - whose drift and rebellion he was able to reflect with perfect authenticity.
As a director, Newman showed a less well-known face: deep in his soul, his truly shy and sensitive man.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (which is an adaptation of the novel by Canadian writer Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, he drew a subtle portrait of a melancholy woman.
The 1984 film “Harry and his son” is a reminder of his son, Scott, who died from a drug overdose.
His close friend and old warrior, Robert Redford (with whom he played in "The Big Bad" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Puppy") said, "His presence has made my life and the world better.
Generosity and the joy of being: that was the secret to the vibrant personality of this great actor we have now lost.
Alongside his legendary career, his struggle for civil rights, the environment, independent film production and criticism of Hollywood’s dishonesty are obscured.
Many times we could see his picture smiling on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He did it with a pretty bad mouth taste, although at first he still thought it was funny.
However, the proceeds from such sales were always transferred to the foundation established for children with the disease.
Newman never sat down on his beads: he remained dedicated to his profession.
In a letter to his five daughters, he wrote: "Your father has always been incredibly grateful for his luck.
It was a privilege for me to be here.”
It is also a privilege for us to be able to follow the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What was produced at the Zuschlag & Tsai factory?
On October 8, the criminal proceedings against Zuschlag János and his colleagues will begin.
The politician and his colleagues are charged with fraud and other criminal offences, including falsification of documents, which have caused significant damage, in a criminal organization.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the money won was used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often proven by fake accounts.
The state and municipal funds – a total of approximately 65 million forints – partly went to the box office of the Young Left and partly to the pockets of some individuals.
The method also described by the investigative authority was that the awarded tender funds were collected on the basis of expenses behind which there was no real performance, and the associations never fulfilled their commitment.
According to the police, most of the accounts were fake.
For these purposes, the bills were purchased in the goods-town market, and the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalason.
And the name of which companies should be used for the production of bills was determined, among other things, on the Balaton upper region tour, to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that he had to look for pensions and restaurants.
He requested an invoice for his consumption there, on the basis of which the invoices to be submitted to the applications of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Social and Labour Office and the Metropolitan Municipality, among others, were prepared.
These were mostly recorded by István Lados with his colleague, Őri András, who, according to our information, mostly wrote the accounts needed to obtain the subsidies.
One of the “study trips” of Lados was a beer house.
According to two invoices issued by the Zuschlagék in 2003, the hostel provided meals for a group of 90 people of the Biztos Pont Association.
However, according to the company manager, they would not have entered the restaurant at the same time.
Similarly, the bill issued by the Foundation for a Better Future (later called Together for the Third Millennium) in the summer of 2002 was full of form and content errors.
In fact, one Badacsonytomay guesthouse had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it for one night, but the bill was about a hundred and thirty guests.
But the imaginative form fillers were exaggerated even when they named Pigal Kft., which is also engaged in hospitality, whose accounting – according to information provided to the prosecutor’s office – did not include the documents for Jobb Future and Hoppá’s name.
The head of the company, Farkas Győző, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and presented his invoices, he immediately knew that the documents were fake.
"Our company name and tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp."
He added that, in addition to formal reasons, it was also unlikely that, according to the bill, a hundred people were accommodated, since they had eleven rooms in which there was not so much space.
In addition, the bill also addressed meals, while their restaurant has not been working for a long time.
The enthusiastic billmakers did not follow the fact that the travel agency in Budapest they looked like organized only overseas trips, so they marked a trip to Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which was also inconsistent with the company’s billing practice.
In addition, as revealed during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, although travel activities to countries outside the European Union were exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was also erroneous in the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for Jobb Jövő, since the company's services are not charged with the indicated 25 percent VAT, but 15 percent, in addition, the hotel employees issued only a machine invoice, but the invoice produced was manual.
In addition, the “exhibitors” were also charged with the fact that in the case of a company, road freight was designated as an activity carried out – it was revealed through the prosecution procedure – which the company, which was originally based on investment advice, did not carry out.
Furthermore, due to formal differences – inappropriate account format, not real stamp – the accounts for the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, the XXI Century Cultural Association and the Trust Point were false.
As was the case with Ravenna Bt. or the Sporttábor in Kunfehertō, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices.
The counterfeiters did not pay attention, for example, to the fact that the HIB Kft. in Tirregyházi was under liquidation at the time (2001), when the Youth City Association group ate there, which is why the liquidator of the company, as we know, denied that he had issued the paper.
They were consciously
Another group of invoice issuers are those who were aware that they had to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Opportunity for Budapest Foundation, at the request of the Young Left – Young Socialists, issued an invoice to the Together Foundation for the Third Millennium for approximately four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the head of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the accused, Györfi Ludovic, to issue the fictitious invoice.
Also cooperated with Zuschlagek the currently under liquidation Biogate Kft., which in 2003 provided the Foundation for the Better Future, the Atlasz Association and the Vörösfenyő Association with accounts worth roughly five million forints, behind which there was no real economic activity.
There was no movement of money, because the prepared bills were subsequently removed, but the organizations had already forgotten to include this in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing the invoice includes those that can be linked to the accused.
Thus, Ivan Kubatov was the delivery agent of the Ukrainian executive of Delta Trió Kft., which deals with fuel and automotive trade, based in Budapest, although not located there.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for sales of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Kiskunhalasi Cash Investment Kft., which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The company was managed by a Romanian man to whom Ivan Kubatov had also handed over the company’s documents between 2002 and 2005.
We know that Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the KFT to Atlas, Hoppa and the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation.
Specifically at the request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian stone craftsmen founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies actually worked, which the accused said was the reason they did not get a job.
However, it benefited the by issuing invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations affiliated with Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation, at the request of his fellow accused, the lawyer Szente Zsolt, who also prepared the company’s founding papers.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the entities a total of 15 accounts worth 14.2 million forints.
The prosecutor believed that 10 percent of the amounts on the bills and VAT hit Kubatov mark.
The man even used Si-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, which were produced for the Biztos Point tender.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and the Alliance for Modern Hungary submitted a bid to the socialist party’s public welfare organization, the Mihály Táncsics Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 thousand forints, but the money was not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
To avoid this, five fictitious bills received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These accounts were found during a house search in the office of Kemecsei Árpád at his educational wallet.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as they did at the prosecutor’s office, will probably report on the course of the bill production.
It may be most interesting if the first-rate accused, János Zuschlag, himself decides to appeal to the veil for everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether this is in the interest of the Socialists, in order to compensate for the majority of the damage, fifty million forints, and Zusi will take the trouble.
Who, by the way, could even be offended today, because his requests to ease the circumstances of his detention, i.e. to be placed in house arrest, have continually been found to the deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes that cause far greater damage and do not compensate for it can walk freely, or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the proceedings against them, they do not have the opportunity to do so.
Psychology of overpricing: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overvaluing the goods.
The foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior have been explored by neuroscientists and economists at the University of New York.
According to their study in the journal Science, people don’t want to be inferior in a type of competition like auctioning on eBay, so they prefer to pay too high prices.
The research attempted to map the nervous system pattern of this "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers took a lottery, the other group took part in a gaming auction while examining the active brain areas of the subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, participants were able to win money, but during the auction game - in which an essential element is the exaggeration of the other party - the under-brain complex called striatum was activated when the game was lost.
This area of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in price can be explained by avoiding the acute reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this, three groups bid against one partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told how much the real value of the product was and they placed their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they won out of the game, they would receive another $15 as a reward.
The third group, on the other hand, received just $15 before the auction, but the members of the group lost that money in the event of a losing auction.
Therefore, the difference between the two groups was only that one of them emphasized the win and the other the loss.
However, proving the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the team playing "against loss" were willing to bet higher than the control and the "win" group.
"These findings cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
They have so far only explained the phenomena at auctions with the joy of victory and the avoidance of risks.
Only neurological imaging has helped solve the contradiction between these two theories so that we have now come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infections, and chronic liver disease is the leading cause of death in Hungary.
There are hundreds of thousands of people infected with hepatitis here, but only seven thousand are treated because patients often don’t know they’re infected.
The term hepatitis is the collective name of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, characteristic of hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases caused by them differ.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogen, spread in two main forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (spleen, vaginal secretions, saliva).
Travellers should be vaccinated against the A and B viruses and there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated food, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal complaints, nausea.
After these, yellowness on the skin and the white of the eyes develops, the stool becomes bright, the urine becomes dark, healing can take two to three weeks.
Every year, one million people worldwide die from the more severe form of the disease, hepatitis B-caused liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people receives medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can also lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, because the pathogen destroys the cells of the liver, in many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention and regular screening tests are very important.
There are three groups with a higher than average number of cases: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattooers.
There are currently 200 million people in the world infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus.
Since the disease can already be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is worth consulting a family doctor if any symptoms of unknown origin are detected.
If the disease is detected in time, it can be cured, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus eliminating the infectiousness and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first held in 2004 by organizations representing patients around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Do people who believe in God suffer less?
Recent research has shown that religious belief acts as a kind of pain reliever that may have already facilitated the deaths of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment to explore how belief in God affects people’s perceptions of pain, according to the British Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre investigation, 12 Catholics and an equal number of atheists were electro-shocked while all of them studied a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholics were able to rule out most of the pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, it was also revealed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brains that is responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first in a series of research studies involving academics, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
The test was carried out precisely by attaching a flashing device to the subject’s left hand, which provided the electric shock.
The researchers asked participants to look closely at two paintings, the painting of the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci's painting of the Lady with hermeline in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary would evoke a sort of religious state among the believers, while the Da Vinci image was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and was thought to have a soothing effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive sections while watching either the religious theme or the general picture.
Catholics that during the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe” as “careful” and “quiet, filled with peace.”
When viewing a religious-themed picture, they 12 percent less pain than when seeing Leonardo’s work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any image with a strong impact, even with atheists, only to find the right photo.
"We should find an image that they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the findings.
“Practicing faith should and will in many cases change our personality,” Wright added.
After the great results, the question remains, if Leonardo or a similar-caliber painter showed a picture of a Madonna to the believers, what effect would it have on their pain control?
Would the vision of the Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On your tenth birthday, you can tell Google: you can find at least as much in people’s pockets as the sky above their heads; you know where they’ve been on vacation, what special orders they’re going to and what they’re interested in.
This is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s top executives.
As for the sceptics who draw parallels to Orwell’s horror, they don’t see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s primary goal is to collect even more personal data about its users, which is necessary to keep up with Google’s founder’s original goal of “gathering all the information in the world.”
According to Google, after 10 years of global exploration, the company is only just beginning to manage all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt said he wanted Google to be able to answer questions such as “what should I do tomorrow?” or “what work would really suit me?” – but until then, software could not answer such simple questions because they didn’t know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware that when searching on the Internet, search words are recorded exactly, which IP address they searched for and which page they went to after searching.
Personalized Search, which was launched two years ago, will allow users to store their own browsing background history, recall what they were looking for, what they clicked on, and generate much more personalized results in the long run – the same logic will be used by Recommendations, which will recommend products and services to us based on our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What if they use my data against me if they look at what I’m dealing with? – ask users who are worried about seeing Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, the degree of potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not the guilt, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or even the rebellion against power provokes the counter-reactions on the Internet.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all the searches are not only recorded, but, if justified, can also be passed on to third parties, in such legal cases, the privacy rights of Internet users are not protected by anything.
Per the most recent example of this was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with identification information about pedophiles from its own Orkut social network.
Internet users who were concerned about privacy were able to rise in May, when the company, along with the e-rights advocacy organization EFF, successfully proved its truth in court against the FBI: according to them, Google can no longer be compelled by any paragraph of the constitution to disclose any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully fought around fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms that it has obtained with reference to the ratification of the Children’s Protection Act adopted years earlier, but it has not been able to obtain the search lists of individual users or obtain the full list of websites and keywords for two months.)
Therefore, Google’s judgment is quite controversial: those who are afraid to provide their personal data are beaten up because they feel that their intimate sphere and privacy are compromised by starting to use Google’s services and rebel against them with conservative-image multinationals.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its wild drive of enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users in many countries sees them as the next generation of big companies, the “cool corporation,” as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, which has been recorded as a world conqueror because of Windows, no matter how hard they both struggle for the same goal.
This may be because, unlike Microsoft, Google does not ask its users for an ID code, does not ask for money for its apps, the open, free, constantly updated source code and software package seems much more accessible, younger, cooler than the practice of the official software giant.
However, it may also be because geeks have a clear understanding of the very problematic relationship between privacy and the Internet, which has been attracted by one of the most widely used keywords in recent years, Web 2.0.
In fact, the web 2.0 is about collaboration, about deliberately leaving traces and taking advantage of the channels of communication available to us and while the extent of these varies from person to person, the essence is the same: we show ourselves.
A typical young person can have multiple social media profiles from Facebook to Shanghai, link them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm, which lists their music habits, and then link them all to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and maintain a blog that automatically displays their latest photo galleries, which are stored on Flickr or Picasa.
While you can read about a number of exemplary cases from which it comes to light: a girlfriend can easily find out by seeing the morning photo output of a common circle of friends that her cheating friend has spent the evening with, or she can fired a company employee just because she describes her honest opinion on top management on her blog: a sure, the concept of privacy has been completely revalued to date.
Online life consists of what you show yourself, which is the basic principle behind the behavior of today’s young people.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least avoid Google’s monopoly, can do so (beginning with Scroogle, for example, who uses Google’s search engine but does not intentionally leave a trace).
For example, the number of people who do not deliberately sign up to social networks in order to prevent them from being found can be replaced by alternative versions of Google’s online apps, from text editor to image manager and news reader, which are not bound to huge server parks and which do not make us the best profile we have ever had.
The public is not so secretly waiting for when Google will reveal the protein of your teeth.
With its current value of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms are threatening advertising agency revenue, and the increasing rate of service deployment is causing a headache not only for Microsoft, but also for many other software developers.
However, critical observers find that the top management completely rejected employees’ protests after it doubled the company’s kindergarten fees, found it too expensive for the company to give employees a daily meal, but it’s all overlooked by the fact that Google even in 2006 bowed his head to the Chinese government and, according to their agreement, the company filed out any hits that violate the good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company’s internal rules is not to announce a new service in advance until it’s already in use, but it’s certain that the prospective problems of the coming months and years could move the world at a new point: while some believe Google’s book and magazine scanning and archiving project is so large that the company will soon face the U.S. Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in which we can build a complete health profile with our previous findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can also provide a good basis for the next generation of science fiction writers, the popular novel of Cory Doctorow, Scroogled Point, describes with Orwell’s voice a future in which a person can only be approached alarmingly well from Google’s data.
Two young men helped the double murderer in the pursuit
Two youths were interrogated by the police in the case of the double murder in Odzd, the founded suspicion is that they helped to disappear the traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County Police Headquarters said on Tuesday.
The young men have acknowledged the offence and are currently being charged with complicity.
The two young men - two girls according to MTI information - are defending themselves on their legs.
The crime can be punished with imprisonment up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of committing a crime of assassination of several people.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old man owed more money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off his debt, so last week he betrayed his creditor to an orphanage site, where he was killed with him and then with the man's 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man was prepared in advance to commit the crime, a sign of this is that he committed the murder with a gunscreen locked on the spot.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are being investigated by the police with the participation of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers to Buy Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered 200 million euros (about 5 billion Czech crowns) for the purchase of a 100% stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded by the Czechs from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which plans to sell more than 60% of the shares within a few months.
The Czech Economic Daily E15 reports that the Polish offer represents the highest amount ever offered by interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far submitted an offer.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner and did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated by market experts to be between 5 and 10 billion crowns.
Under the agreement of the shareholders, approximately 90 percent of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent, followed by Ceská Sporitelna bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
On Tuesday, leading European newspapers, in comments devoted to the deepening international financial crisis, have already referred to "the second September 11th."
The global financial catastrophe is due to the President of the United States – accuses La Repubblica of Rome – the President has not even been able to rank his own party behind the broken bill aimed at redressing the desperate situation.
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about the second September 11th.
A portion of the media in Madrid also sees the crimes in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has put the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing, and then the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but the Congressional vote threatens Washington not to offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air – at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, according to the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Nowadays, some states can still provide a rescue tool for bankrupt financial institutions and save them from bankruptcy with the money of the taxpayers.
But if more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither the funds nor the improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Only on Monday, weakening financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros, according to the Viennese newspaper Der Standard, which said fears are becoming more and more realistic that European taxpayers, like Americans, will have to go deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis.
Until now, the EU has not taken the crisis seriously, which is sweeping through the old continent like a tsunami.
“Rescue workers” do not have to flag hundreds of billions of euros right away, but it would be good if they recorded: in which case it is reasonable to resort to taxpayers’ money to prevent greater damage.
Dungeon flight is imitated by smart car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid collisions if not by imitating obstacle sensors in the world of nature?
For example the bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, Dongo bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic starting point for how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C bio-oriented car robot control system, a robotic mini-car equipped with the properties of bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to develop a system that eliminates all collisions.
“While flying, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety cover,” explains Kazuhhiro Doi, technology PR and R&D brand director.
The complex eye of the uterus, which can see in all directions at a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role.
To replicate the function of the complex eye, the engineers turned to the idea of a laser telemetry.
This identifies obstacles within a distance of 2 meters in a 180-degree field before the BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an operation to avoid a collision.
In a fraction of a second, the obstacle is detected, and then the car robot imitates the movements of the uterus, immediately changing the direction of its wheels to the extent necessary to avoid the collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoidance maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If this were not the case, the car robot’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” says Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and car robot project.
You must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of the safety cover, a layer within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what one bee does in order to avoid other bees.
This process must take place at a glance.
But, unlike bees, the deviation may not be directed upwards, downwards, or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the reversibility of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to avoid other bees, only rotating movement and acceleration, as well as slowing, were used here as the option available to the car robot.
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer life than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, instinctive intelligent response is important, not the ability to process data, let alone the ability to store it.
This structure only needs to process and respond to a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need to save them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, so you constantly use only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
No gigabytes or even megabytes of memory are needed.
This is the first step in the development of instantaneous evasion technology, which Nissan estimates could be used in mass-production vehicles within ten years.
An additional application may be to combine the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to drive the car to the specified destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Name of the Poison Child
A written version of a multi-disclosure bank bailout package of $700 billion has been prepared to buy bad loans from banks.
In the first round, half of the amount is spent.
During further talks on the East Coast time from Saturday until midnight, congressional leaders have come to a debate over a $700 billion bailout plan that has been ongoing for days, Reuters.
“We have made serious progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying the deal had only to be put on paper.
The deal was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Speaking about the compromise, Finance Secretary Henry Paulson said the program would work and be effective, but further action is needed, according to Pelosi, not to save Wall Street, but to turn the wheel of the economy.
The written version of the package was released before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday night at 8pm (central European time) but did not cause a spectacular rise in the stock exchange.
The draft law, known as the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, will be voted first by the House of Representatives on Monday and then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress we have made overnight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our money markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program, by the way, differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal that the $700 billion would have been spent one by one on purchasing low-quality, credit-backed securities.
Now, in the first round, up to half of the $700 billion could be spent using $250 billion immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the matter on Monday, from which the Treasury Department will buy credit-based, poorly-rated securities, and the fate of another $100 billion will depend on the president's decision.
The program will be supervised by a special body with the president of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion will depend on a new congressional decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage transfer securities, as well as other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase can be made in the context of auctions and directly, the ministry said.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the financial wallet guarantees the assets that cause concern, for which the companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said the law would provide the tools needed to meet up to $700 billion in urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it be large-scale purchases of bad assets, their insurance, or avoiding the systemic risk of a major financial institution’s collapse.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed.
The bosses of banks in trouble and waiting for state aid, on the other hand, can expect their withdrawal money—which overseas slang simply calls a gold parachute—to be restricted by the government.
Wages are restricted only in certain cases, and the limits depend on the ways in which the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if you buy at auction by the ministry, you will be charged an extra tax on the gold parachute unless you retire the levyed banker.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that management money is not exaggerated.
The image adds that existing gold parachute contracts are unchanged, the restriction applies only to new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first time in U.S. history that legal restrictions will be imposed on the remuneration of CEOs, said Barney Frank, chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services.
In addition, the state acquires the right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can eventually win the transaction as the economy and with it the rescued bank recover.
The bill stipulates that over the next five years, the president will have to submit a proposal to Congress on how to reimburse the expected losses from the financial sector to taxpayers.
Both sides expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, that is, it does not protect taxpayer dollars, said Republican MP Darrell Issa of California.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, believed the measures were prompted by the same people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1% in August 2008 compared to the previous month and by 12.9% compared to August 2007.
Prices of industrial export sales were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008 and 3.9 percent lower than a year earlier.
As a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial producer prices were 0.7% higher than the previous month and 3.2% higher than the previous year.
Domestic sales prices of the industry increased only a minimum of 0.1% compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sectors also increased slightly, by 0.1% compared to July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was in the leather and footwear sectors (2,8 percent), mainly due to the monthly price increase of bags, stripes and footwear by 4.6 percent.
The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1,6 percent).
Prices dropped in oil processing (1,4 percent), electrical machinery, instrument manufacturing (0,9 percent) and, to a minimum extent, in wood processing (0,1 percent).
Prices for paper production, publishing and printing activities remained unchanged.
In other manufacturing sectors, prices increased between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supplies, which have a significant weight in domestic sales for the industry, prices increased by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the overlapping effect of the official gas price increases carried out from 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison – in terms of domestic sales in the manufacturing sectors – the most significantly increased prices were in the oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
Prices increased by 13.2% in the metal processing sector and 11% in the food, beverage and tobacco sectors.
Prices fell in the textile and textile manufacturing sectors (2.5 percent) and in the manufacturing of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 percent).
In the other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price growth ranged from 0.6 percent to 9.1 percent.
Prices in the manufacturing industry have increased by 10.2% over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supplies sectors were 18.7% higher than a year earlier.
In domestic sales, the sectors producing investment goods showed the highest monthly price increase in the target sectors in August (0.7%).
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 percent, while in the energy and reuse sectors prices remained unchanged compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, the highest price increase compared to the same month of the previous year was in the energy and reuse sectors (16.8 percent).
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 6.8 percent and in the investment goods sector, prices decreased by 1.4 percent.
The industry’s export sales prices in forints increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to 12 months.
Over the course of a month, our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro, by 7.1 per cent against the dollar, by 7.5 per cent against the euro and by 15.9 per cent against the dollar compared to August 2007.
Do you need a visa to travel to the United States next year?
Göncz Kinga sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into effect around January 12 – the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago, before local Hungarian leaders.
According to him, “almost everything now depends on the timely implementation of the electronic entry and control system overseas.”
The new system will not include a travel permit, but tourists will need to register before departure.
Foreign ministers are holding talks in Washington today.
He meets with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is awarded the Order of the Hungarian Republic of Merit with the Star, and holds talks with foreign policy advisors of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Obama and McCain also support the bank rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, assured the government of a $700 billion bailout package on Sunday, but there is a politician who is demanding the Treasury Secretary's resignation.
After days of marathon negotiations, Congress and the administration announced early Sunday that they had reached a principled agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package aimed at melting up the frozen credit market became central to the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain have said they are more likely than their competitors to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, by putting economic issues in the forefront, Obama has once again gained some advantage, melting out McCain’s advantage after the Republican convention, with Sarah Palin’s vice president nomination.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the $700 billion bill would be promptly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal includes the consumer passports he has also supported.
“We must act now with responsibility... your jobs, your savings, entire industries, the stability of the entire economy are in danger,” he said in front of the crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain’s economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “We will all have a hard time swallowing this... but doing nothing is simply not a way to go.”
The Republican senator said the proposal included the establishment of a supervisory committee for the Minister of Finance and restrictions on the dismissal of top executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the talks, but that he was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill on Monday.
The German Language Area
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp have voters become more self-conscious, so Der Spiegel analyses the weak presence of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider is ready to govern Austria in order to prevent the Red-Black Coalition.
by Der Spiegel (de)
In an online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter, in an article entitled The Bavarian Revolution Eats His Parents, analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades – and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of times is also a problem for the entire Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that was almost exactly probable ten years ago ended: an undisputed hegemony of a state party ceased.
In 1998, the CSU dropped to 47.7 percent for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so even in the Stoiber era.
This is due to the consistent modernization carried out by the CSU in the province, which consumes its parents.
Sociologists have predicted this for 40 years, but they have made a great mistake in the pace. However, secularization, educational achievements, and the settlement of East and Northern Germans into the developing regions of Bavaria could not have had consequences for the loyalty of the voters to the CSU.
Modernization is accompanied by increasing opportunities, and the political consequences of this are also visible.
The right-wing camp was intact, only within the camp the voters became more self-conscious, more critical, more self-confident.
It is also remarkable that, in recent weeks, it is the classical civic groups that have mostly moved away from the CSU: freelancers, industrialists, graduates and graduates.
The support of the CSU has already fallen below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper, in an article entitled “Who, with whom? the party leaders in the restrained coalition issues”, addresses the confusing internal political situation after the Austrian elections.
The SPO wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPP is prohibited from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens are not yet willing to negotiate a coalition.
The election has been made, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, party leaders barely allowed insight into their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann has confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible – in some provinces and in social partnership.
The question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer – with the current ÖVP president as vice-Chancellor – Faymann left open.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was rejected in any case.
Repetition in this direction is not a question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the cooperation will not be effective if Faymann attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is currently fully open in the party, issues must be discussed within the ÖVP.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider has repeatedly been open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility from the government,” Haider said.
The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken.
The European Summit on Gender Equality, which this year is hosted by the French Presidency of the European Union, began today in Paris.
Járóka Lívia, a member of the European People’s Party in Fidesz, as one of the main speakers of the professional council, in her message to the plenary addressed education segregation, because it is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and also the most serious obstacle to their implementation.
The high-level conference was opened on behalf of the French Presidency by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equality.
Representatives from governments, European social partners and leading European rights advocates and NGOs in the field of equal opportunities were invited to attend the meeting.
Járóka – according to the press office of the Fidesz EP group – warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are being excluded from the labour market mainly because of their low education.
“The overwhelming majority of Roma young people do not have a secondary education, and low-quality primary education leads to a small percentage of them getting a higher education.”
Járóka also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in upholding other human rights.
Investing in early childhood education for Roma children can strengthen the economies of the EU Member States.
It is necessary to raise awareness of these relationships as widely as possible, both among Roma and non-Roma.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more likely they are to become productive members of the labour market and contribute to the national budget through taxes on income and consumption.
“The right of Roma to quality education must be guaranteed by their EU citizenship and the elimination of low-quality and differentiated education must be guaranteed,” said Járóka Lívia.
According to the MEP, a goal-oriented and action-oriented union of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the processes of school segregation immediately, and it is essential to properly comply with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
“We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, give Roma children the opportunities given by the democratic space to contribute as full citizens to the future of Europe,” Járóka said.
The European Gender Summit, which has been held annually since the Berlin Summit last year, aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: grace for transitional time
It will be announced at the end of the year that the Huber-Beckstein duo will be released.
Despite the abominable election failure, heads have not yet fallen, the Bavarian CSU summits have so far postponed the discussion of personal issues.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and provincial prime minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in office, questioning how long the grace will last.
The fate of the Tandem, which suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 percent of the votes, will be decided by an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
The members of the highly criticized couple, in any case, felt: they do not stick with all their strength to their chair.
In doing so, they sought to calm the angry members of the faction and the base, who one day after the "Bajor tsunami" demanded personal consequences for losing the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career, the Christian Social Union gained 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it runs to only 43.4 percent of its strength.
For 46 years, the CSU has dominated Bavaria, accounting for 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the Conservatives continue to count highly in the key southern province for Hungary’s economy, they will be forced to form a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of a reorganization within the party, Huber’s potential successor, Vice President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture, will also be placed in the narrow intelligence team that is launching blatant negotiations with the liberal FDP and right-wing Free Electors on a possible coalition in Munich.
The strange feature of fate is that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited by the Huber-Beckstein couple as a coup d’état, came into the legislature on the list of Free Voters and was then ruthlessly treated by the ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now putting all their energy to somehow stabilize Becstein.
Stoiber, who has been actively involved in the transition, called September 28 the bitterest day in the political career of the former prime minister and former CSU president.
Huber made a few yellow remarks to the CDU on Monday, saying they deserved much more support from the brotherhood party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel as well.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel could not be chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the country’s success in 2005, was somehow restored by joint force.
Merkel, who has had difficulty disguising her disappointment over the fiasco, said the loss of ground by the CSU would not have a negative impact on the big coalition in Berlin.
What is, of course, relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to handle, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
The SPD recorded its weakest result in Bavaria since 1946 with 18.6 percent.
Lukasenko’s opposition: 110-0
None of the opposition members entered the Belarusian parliament following Sunday’s elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) by irregularities in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which has 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the legislature of the country of 10 million has been without the opposition for a decade, the opposition, joined together as the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections, was seriously hoping that following the constitutional amendment, Lukashenko, who renewed his presidency for the fourth time in the controversial elections in 2006, would "allow" some opposition members to appear in parliament.
The ODS also withdrew from the previously considered boycott.
The opposition’s expectations were that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia – which has taken credit to curb the continuously expensive Russian gas imports and contributed to the transfer of Beltransgaz, which has gas pipelines that pass through the country, into Russian hands – wanted to improve its relations with the EU, where Lukashenko and several senior politicians are denied entry due to the anti-democratic Belarusian political arrangement.
For relief, he pointed out that when evaluating the election campaign, the OSCE focused on positive moves rather than shortcomings, such as the ban on a third of opposition candidates from running.
However, the OSCE’s quick report on Monday already criticized the campaign – during which opposition candidates were essentially not allowed to appear in the press – and in particular that the opposition was not allowed to attend the vote count.
At the same time, according to the opposition, there is a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to have a minor confrontation with Moscow, continuing to refuse to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which have separated from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper - has regarded the two territories as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevitch told the newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this will remain, despite the fact that "the power is afraid of allowing even one opposition to enter the weak parliament."
The opposition is not planning to protest the results, but is trying to convey its message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
“Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, the local authorities are hindering the distribution, but I still see more and more people supporting change, even among the elderly,” Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security as its main achievement, is not adequate even by the most officially supported layer of pensioners.
Because of the country’s debt, the growth of the trade deficit, it is a matter of time to break down the social security, which recalls “the silence of the cemetery,” Milinkevich said.
Russian observers described the election as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People don't believe in words, but in deeds," so the absence of the opposition is nothing more than a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Breakfast only before working hours"
In a unique way in the history of Chigi Palace, rotating doors were installed to allow workers to enter and exit.
This new measure comes into effect today against prosecutors, to filter out those who block you and then go out to drink a coffee during working hours.
The anti-solar novelty was presented today by Minister of Administration Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Prime Minister's Office.
“Their gateways,” Brunetta said, “are for working better and more efficiently, reducing gaps and increasing services.”
“We are in a new, more responsible and transparent period.
This is the real reform,” Brunetta said.
With the Chigi Palace, the equipment of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers will be completed.
According to Masi, “the installation of the rotating gates is also symbolically important.”
We did not experience any resistance from the staff, the secretary-general confirmed: "The staff approved the measure, everyone cooperated."
In short, breakfast is over at work, no more coffee and breweries.
Brunetta smiles and advises: “A good little cappuccino at seven in the morning can do wonders.”
Rome College of Public Administration
During the meeting, the minister explained: “In three months, the number of public sector workers who are absent due to illness has decreased by 50 percent, which means that there are sixty thousand more people working in one year.”
He added that the government should be more efficient.
In the past eight to ten years, the wage dynamics of the private sector have been twice as high as that of the private sector and have also exceeded the inflation rate.”
At the same time, thousands of civil servants have gathered together to join a petition sponsored by the Italian Association of Environmental and Consumer Associations to protest the requirements of the Brunetta regulation.
“While the administration minister boasts data supporting the reduction of illness-related shortages, the number of ‘unfathomable daybags’ is growing,” the consumer protection association writes.
Thousands of honest and hard-working government officials across Italy have gathered to declare war on the illegal regulations of the decree."
The regional administrative court is challenged, inter alia, by the abolition of the supplementary allowance for illness due to occupational reasons, the extension of the period of stay at home of workers on sick leave, which means the period within which the patient visitor may appear, and several other criteria contained in the new provisions laid down by the Minister.
Workplace accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything else
Every day there are 2,500 workplace accidents in Italy, including 3 deaths and 27 permanent disabilities.
According to the workplace accident insurance company, 1,200 workplace deaths occurred in 2007.
The figures testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that still remains one of the most common causes of death today, with twice as many casualties as homicides.
Today, for the 58th time, Anmil organizes the Day of Victims of Occupational Accidents in all Italian counties, which is traditionally celebrated on the second Sunday of October, to draw the attention of institutions, social organizations and the mass media to this dramatic problem.
“The worrying figures by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, support the crucial role that prevention plays in workplace accidents,” said President Giorgio Napolitano in a message to Pietro Mercandelli, President of the National Association of Workplace Disabled Persons.
The head of state sincerely praised “the association’s enduring commitment to workplace prevention, the protection of workers who suffered accidents, the help of victims’ families and the sensitivity of the public.”
“These tragedies of this nature, which in their magnitude have attracted the interest of the media and the public, cause a natural and frankly shared indignation, but in reality we face dramatic cases which are repeated every day.”
Napolitano openly admits: "We are undoubtedly struggling with a shortage of resources, financing education and information is crucial.
Initiatives within schools aimed at direct education of young people on the verge of entering the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to maintain the interest in the phenomenon, not to let the attention of the social importance of the issue faint, and there is a need for more effective legislation that must be enforced.
Gianfranco Fini, the chairman of the House of Representatives, said: “The seriousness of work-related accidents that result in deaths is of a social importance that burdens the conscience of all of us, and the institutions are required to end it as soon as possible.”
"Data on workplace accidents shows slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this type is still surprisingly high," said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
“We don’t want this declining trend to be coupled with declining attention, because the greatest tragedies happen when the attention drops.”
"We believe that at the general level we still do not do everything to overcome this phenomenon, which could be solved through a complex programme of action.
We believe that stricter supervision and control would be needed, Mercandelli stressed, as well as greater intervention in the field of workforce training, starting from school education.”
"More efforts are needed to inform and sensitize the public," he added.
What we need most, however, is a more responsible employer’s environment in the face of a phenomenon that poses a social problem.”
Mercandelli then criticized "the gradual deterioration of the compensation protection net for victims of workplace accidents" and the "help trend towards which the system has shifted in recent years".
“The goal is, therefore, to restore the workers the security provided by insurance, because the fate of those who suffer an accident cannot depend on the arbitrary measures of the lawmakers and where the distribution.”
MP3 players can cause hearing loss
Permanent hearing loss may be caused by listening to portable devices for a long time and at high volume, such as MP3 devices.
This is stated in a report published in Brussels by the European Commission, citing the opinion published today by the EU Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
"The report shows that 5-10 percent of people who listen to their portable music player at high volume for more than an hour a day for five years can suffer from permanent hearing loss," the report said.
"It is worrying that young people who use high-volume portable music players and mobile phones massively and frequently are unaware that they can cause irreversible damage to their hearing," said Meglena Kuneva.
“Scientific studies indicate an undeniable risk to which we need to react urgently,” he said.
The main task is to inform consumers and to disseminate information on this subject.
In the light of that opinion, we should also review existing control systems to ensure that they are effective and keep up with the latest technologies.”
Brussels has asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in light of the prevalence of portable music players and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise they cause.
“The researchers confirm that we have reason to be concerned, and the European Commission is ready to work with Member States and stakeholders to examine possible measures to protect children and young people exposed to the noise of portable players and similar devices,” the committee concluded.
The current European safety standard sets the maximum noise level to be emitted by portable music players at 100 dB, but there is growing concern about hearing loss caused by overuse of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions, such as reducing the level and duration of noise damage, which can significantly reduce these hearing impairments.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee explains that users of portable players who listen to music at a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week exceed the current maximum level of noise exposure to workplace noise.
If you listen to music for a long time under similar conditions, there is a risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects approximately 5 to 10 percent of people using portable devices, which could amount to 2.5 to 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno establishes a committee responsible for the future of the capital
It starts today, lasts until March, and results are expected in June.
This timetable was set by the Metropolitan Municipality for the work of the committee "The future of the capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the baths of Caracalla.
During the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the Rome Directives.
After the final speech in March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the general assembly and the municipal committee in order to submit in June the capital strategic plan officially approved by the municipality and Mayor General Gianni Alemanno.
“It is a completely independent committee that represents all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas – Alemanno emphasizes – and its task is to develop proposals for Rome’s development visions, which can be relied upon by policy makers, i.e. the General Assembly and the Municipal Committee.
There is no conflict of jurisdiction, we just wanted a platform where great plans for Rome could be created.
In March, after he has completed his work, the committee will be dissolved because it has a mandate for a fixed time.
In June, we will submit a strategic plan based on the work of the committee "The future of the capital of Rome", the mayor said.
To those who consider the Commission’s work unnecessary, citing the fact that its expert opinion is not binding, Alemanno replies: “It all depends on the Commission’s work and the quality of the proposals it puts on the table.
If the standard proves appropriate, as was the case with the Attali Commission in France, which I am certain of in the case of Rome, its contribution will play an important role.
The power of policy is often fragmented in the handling of everyday affairs, as well as in dealing with urgent cases that arise from time to time.
On the other hand, we look further, we plan for the longer term, and we are committed to Rome’s development and future.”
The mayor of Rome wants to clarify that “this Commission cannot be regarded as a useless ‘waterhead’ because it is completely free, it will not cost a single euro to the citizens of Rome, instead it serves as a stimulation of thought and aims to engage the capital’s best minds.”
Alemanno said: “We need an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that will allow our city to make the standard leap it needs so much, thinking in a unified spirit about its future.”
On the future, which the mayor of Rome emphasizes, “it will not only be limited to the current framework of self-government, but will look much further,” we see in it not only the future metropolis and capital status, but also “the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean region.”
Obama is the first anti-American president.
A well-known American politician who declared himself independent wrote about it: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
He was the first Jimmy Carter to make decisions that ruined the American economy andined close ties (as he does today as a private person) with hostile Islam.”
As the election date approaches, the attacks on Obama intensify.
A Miami lady wrote on the internet: “This man is full of ambition.
Obama is blatantly believing that he can earn the highest public dignity of a nation whose two governors and five senators have been black.”
These attacks are actually nonsensical; they are of course racist, but they don’t answer the voters’ question of whether he will be a good president.
There are people who listen to their emotions, not their minds.
Inside the South, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in its lead article: We know well who the real American patriot is voting for in the polling station.
A side of American thinking appears here that has remained hidden until the last moment.
“Just talk what you want, and we’ll know where we’ll put it, Obama or McCain.”
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
Never before have such words been spoken until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
However, despite all these insights, the winning weapon of the Democrats is George Bush himself.
1500 people were asked what were the mistakes they made during Bush’s presidency? 89 percent answered Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and they were bowed to their backs so that they flew home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed and the Americans did not have to pack.
The majority of Americans believe that Iraq was Bush’s weak spot.
A huge task awaits him who will take the place of George W. Bush.
U.S.: The economic collapse is already felt by journalists, and the time has come for austerity in editorial offices.Many blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The Pew Research Institute asked five hundred journalists in the United States what they thought about the future status and intellectual power of their profession.
Nowadays, almost every journalist is pessimistic about their own future.
However, they did not clearly state that their concerns about credibility had diminished.
They don’t feel as isolated as before.
The problem with journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis was a failure of a weak economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions on the newsroom, i.e. the editorial agencies that produce the newspaper.
If we do not want traditional journalism, in the sense of what the general public understood, to shrink to a minimum, this problem must be solved, the journalists interviewed say.
Today, American journalism is characterized by clear and complex pessimism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior executives working in print media are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65 percent of journalists are in top management positions.
Printed versus electronic press.
It is not difficult for the media staff to see where the world’s internet is going.
The biggest publishers are breaking their way to the Internet, which many consider to be the “killer” of the printed press.
The “economic pressure” perceived by journalists rose to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists surveyed admitted to voting for technology in the hope that it might benefit journalism.
Today, in the American press industry, there is a gap between editorial managers, i.e. directors, and the correspondents who work for them.
At the national level, 56% of executives are confident that their reporters are sharing information with others, compared to only 23% at the local level.
Some people associate this with safe workplace.
47% of managers fear that they will lose their jobs within three years.
For journalists, this percentage is 30 percent.
In America, the issue of “safe work” at the team level (in the case of our editors, ed.) is constantly on the agenda.
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
With a huge nation like the 300-million-populated United States, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and Internet providers operate, employers tend to offer as much as they want, so the thing works on a “must or should not” basis.
Directors usually get high salaries, and editors can earn tens of thousands of dollars a month in addition to paying retirement and health insurance fees.
Freedom, on the other hand, works on a rather complicated principle: in the first year x days, in the third also, until after a certain period of time it reaches a maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, according to their own confession, are often “sick” during the year.
It all depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: THE COURT OF ROME: DANILO COPPOLA STILL GROTTAFERRATABAN
Carmelo Rinaudo, the chairman of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, rejected the request of the real estate businessman Danilo Coppola, who sought to move from his place of residence, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for economic bankruptcy as part of an investigation into a deal between Unipol and BNL.
Last week, during the proceedings against him, his house arrest was lifted and changed to a ban on eviction for Grottaferrata.
Her lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the real estate professional pass from a rural town to a capital apartment.
However, according to the court, these moves (for which the prosecutor proposed a rejection) would allow him to influence the company’s affairs and access the evidence raised against him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote for the $700 billion bailout proposed by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were more interested and still interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which reports that the current crisis has created a crackdown within the Republican Party, which shows a growing divide between the traditional, restrained East Coast attitude that supports federal institutions and business circles and the growing anti-Washington and financial new trend in the central and southern states.
This trend was expressed critically in the voting in the House of Representatives mentioned in the introduction.
However, the above event is only one of the major changes that the economic restructuring that is still ongoing predicts or makes visible, and not only in the United States, but in the entire Western world, and beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the United States and in Europe, is only accelerating the phenomena that have long been out of place, which are consolidating in this new atmosphere and finally coming to light.
The first such phenomenon is the re-actualization, the return of the double category of state sovereignty to the public consciousness, in connection with a sort of re-nationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis affects those banking and financial institutions, which, whileining close ties with the outside world, are primarily, and in a fairly broad way, engaging people and families who live in one country, in one state.
This, in turn, represents a direct political difficulty for those in government: what to respond to the difficulties and protests of those who are also voters.
Thus, although the crisis seems to be global in economic terms, it is almost exclusively national in political terms.
Political internationalism appears to be essentially stranded outside the coastline: the European Union is a strong proof of this, unable to set a unified political orientation in the midst of different interests and different national strategies.
So everyone expects the individual national governments to intervene, the rescue package, the rebound and the new rules, but above all the opening of funds: because in a difficult situation only the individual states have economic resources, a financial reserve that can be able to fix things.
They also have the tools and the authority to use them: under certain circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that no other market or international organization will possess to such an extent.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on the national state is fully consistent with the fact that the recent economic growth has attributed an increasing importance to one factor that is closely linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the abstract world of the network, an increasingly sophisticated technology, and were convinced that the global financial world was destined to rule the world, we had to realize that our future increasingly depended on abstract things such as water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one half of the planet to the other, yet are entirely bound to a delimited place, a territory.
Thus, the one who controls the territory has far more cards than the one who unfortunately was born in a place where there is no harvest, no oil, and no water.
I would like to go on to the second issue, which is a kind of breakdown line.
Whoever says that it is territory, state, government, necessarily also says: politics, in other words, leadership.
From this perspective, the economic crisis seems to produce two intertwined phenomena:
On the one hand, an objective recognition of the need for authentic leadership, someone who can take the events in hand.
On the other hand, the current leadership brings a total credit loss, especially to economic managers, who have proved completely inadequate and have proved that many are still in the vague field ahead of them.
Together, the two have even deeper significance and in a sense worrisome: the feeling of loss of credit, impatience, inadequacy and separation that affects the entire leadership elite in a growing number of Western countries.
Therefore, it seems that there is a growing belief among the population that the time of the social elite at its peak has ended. It has ended, even before their actions, experiences, lifestyles, cultures, in the complex sense of the word, have been embraced.
In a word, the demand for leadership, in a covert form, feeds a multi-faceted but strong delegitimization movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system. This is manifested in the unexpected "revolts" of voters or in recent sudden changes in public mood. Such as the rise of conservatives to power in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the workers' unity in Great Britain, or the uprising of U.S. congressional representatives against Bush (and the victory of the Italian right).
It seems that the traditional elite, with its parties, programs, and even with its customs, press, and renowned intellectuals, is becoming less and less understandable, and therefore less and less able to represent what has been happening for a while in the deeper layers of Western society.
Despite all this, speaking of “the imminent revolt of the masses” would be frankly exaggerated.
Walking with your eyes open doesn’t hurt.
We can walk on the wall with super-strong glue
Use a super-powerful glue to overcome gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This goal has been set by several U.S. research centers, and a team of four institutions is close to the solution.
With just 2.5 square centimeters of glue, the researchers managed to glue a body of 100 kilos to a vertical wall and keep it there.
The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scientists was derived from the further development of previously existing special materials called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of functioning of the glue should be conceived as a pack of spaghetti-like tube system," says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers derived the idea from the leg of the geckos covered with microscopic folds, which provides the animal with perfect adhesion.
Tests with different materials such as glass, teflon and slicing paper have confirmed that the new glue is ten times more efficient than those of the reptiles, but it is "easy to remove from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
“This material can be useful as a temporary glue,” adds Liming Dai.
Maybe yes, but researchers prefer to think of a less impressive use like connecting electronic devices because carbon nanotubes conduct heat and electricity well.
It can also be used in space exploration.
The superheroes can wait.
The University of California, Berkeley, is also conducting experiments with a new glue.
According to an article published in the journal American Chemical Society, scientists in California have unveiled a hair-like glue made of a micro-fiber material that undergoes self-cleansing when moving on the surface, thus always providing perfect adhesion.
Drugs are prohibited.
Be careful with grapefruit, oranges and apples.
These high-vitamin drinks, especially popular in the summer, when taken together with certain life-saving medicines, alter their absorption, increasing or decreasing their effects, depending on the case.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, highlighted the risks associated with the use of fresh juices and certain medicines at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, announcing that a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, thus preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of the patient.
Grapefruit juice had been placed on the bench before when it was discovered that it was able to enhance the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anti-anxiety, heart rhythm-regulating and neuropharmaceuticals to levels considered to be toxic.
Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmacy itself published the news in the Official Gazette and warned doctors and patients to take the risks associated with this co-consumption seriously and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – Researchers say orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
It could be a long list of active substances that are blocked by the absorption of grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, Professor of Pharmacy at the State University of Milan, said: “Discoveries of this kind are usually immediately to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutes, who, if necessary, make sure that they change the information on the medicinal product leaflet.
Therefore, we should always read the leaflet of the medication we intend to collect, and if something is incomprehensible, let us not let ourselves be influenced, but clearly ask our doctor or pharmacist," emphasized the specialist of the Ansa Institute.
Paul Krugman wins Nobel Prize in Economics
Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his analysis of trade models and the territorial relations of economic activity.
Krugman, a 55-year-old Neokynesian, teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the heaviest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in a New York Times lead article that the latter event would have even more fatal consequences for U.S. history than the collapse of the Twin Towers.
This prediction has sparked a lot of debate, it has been thrown into the eyes of economists several times, but today we know it was accurate.
“I’m surprised and a bit shocked to see how quickly public interest has surpassed the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “extremely valuable economist” and at the same time rather “aggressively spreads his criticism of the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.”
Open Office, its third edition is worth the "anti-Microsoft" package
OpenOffice.org 3.0 is an open-source application package for personal productivity, a free alternative to Microsoft Office, targeting a wider range of people from home to office, freelancers to public administration.
Following almost a year of work by SUN Microsystem and volunteer developers, the new Open Office comes to the public with a number of new features: in addition to the welcome screen and the reimagined, less spartan user interface, it also offers a number of significant innovations, such as Apple’s compatibility with Mac OS X and support for the new ISO-standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Special attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007, so Open Office can also open Microsoft documents with new extensions (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting is the specific functionality of some modules, such as one that allows you to reduce the size of your PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files via email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into a graphic module by keeping the page layout.
On this interface, we can also create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with table manager or text editor elements.
In-app sharing has also undergone a number of improvements: the spreadsheet manager supports the sharing of workbooks but prevents each other’s work from being overwritten.Each employee’s posts are marked in different colors, which makes it easier to recognize them during the verification phase.
Some companies are already working to make some of OpenOffice’s features available from the Internet (on the cloud, in the cloud), so the final version may be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, after being posted on the mirror pages since Friday, can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The software package is also available for Linux in addition to the standard Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
The installation CD can be obtained at home or at work.
Free is probably the biggest attraction when it comes to the spread of the home app, but the Open Office package is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector as you can count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There is also a lack of educational, consulting and service services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, a Word-compatible text editor; Calc, a spreadsheet manager designed to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase, the most well-known, similar to the Access database manager; and finally Draw, the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads.But considering that with the release of the new version we are already at 3,600,000, this number is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl's results are positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
In the last phase of the Tour de France, one of the participants, Austrian Bernhard Kohl, competing for the Gerolsteiner team, again produced a positive pattern, who won the bronze medal as well as the best mountain climbing trio.
The news came to light on the website of the Equipe.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth driver, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol, and German Stefan Schumacher, who also runs Gerolsteiner, who produced a positive result in the Cera test of the third generation of the EPO.
Kohl’s blood sample, like the tests carried out in recent weeks, has been examined by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the test results confirm a positive Cera score, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be banned from competing for two years.
The news of the positive outcome of Kohl’s third-generation EPO test was also confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and told the Associated Press news agency that he signaled the positive double-effect to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian got the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and also won the spot t-shirt for the best mountain climber.
Immigrants: The New York Times Asks the Question, Is Italy Racist?
Italy has just recently turned from a country of immigrants to a favorite destination for reluctant immigrants.
This question is challenged by the New York Times, which, starting from the case of the young Burkina Fasoan Abdul William Guibre - who was murdered in Milan last month for stealing a box of biscuits - devotes a long article to the debate around racism in Italy.
The case characterizes what the New York Times calls the “Northern Paradox”: the northern regions have “the strongest integration and the highest employment rates” while the “anti-immigration and Northern League support” are also the strongest in the country.
To support the growing tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also cites cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact .
The new laws demanded by the League to tighten the barrier on immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants are also seen as examples of the mood shift in Italy.
This trend is also highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano met with Benedict XVI at the Quirinale Palace and called for the state and the Church to work together to defeat racism."
Students suffer from high rents, a room can cost up to 900 euros
The market for university housing is not affected by the crisis.
According to a recent survey by Sunia, the Association of Housing Renters, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
“Today, the phenomenon has reached such an incredible magnitude that, due to the high total costs incurred on families, a wide range of students are blocked from learning,” explains Laura Mariani, head of the study office at Sunia. “The high demand for students in these cities has distorted the market to such an extent that a general price hike has begun against the local population.”
In most cases, real estate offers also include a series of irregularities: unregistered contracts with no rental time limit, associated sub-lease.
According to Sunia, an emergency measure would be needed to enable prices to be maximized through a revision of the tax system.
The details of the survey show that in Milan, near Brianza, a bed is also asked for 450 euros; the price of a single room ranges from 650 euros (abroad of Bande Nere) to an average of 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but can also reach 900 euros (abroad of Vittoria).
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, and a room costs about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where the majority of students live in a neighborhood close to the university, a bed costs 250 to 280 euros if it is a double bed and 370 to 500 euros if it is a single bedroom.
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), they ask for about 600 euros for a single bed and 450 for a double bed.
Prices are slightly cheaper (550 euros per single room) in the vicinity of other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can all save a little in suburban districts: it costs 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, for a bedroom they ask for 300/450 euros, for a room from 400 to 600 euros. The price discount is the highest in the vicinity of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In the bar, you have to pay 250/350 euros for a bed and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute value, but they represent a greater weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where non-EU students are also frequently looking for accommodation, another disorder is experienced: rents requested from foreign students are approximately 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Farewell to the old Cinema Paradiso, the time of the old cinemas has been sacrificed in the cities
Traditional cinemas are closed in favor of the Multiplexes.
“A city without a cinema, a blind city, is like a face without eyes.”
Images taken by director Giuseppe Tornatore illustrate what is happening in Italian cities, but also in rural areas.
The expulsion of the cinemas – the emergence of large, multi-room cinemas in the suburbs and, consequently, the extinction of the one-room cinemas in the city centers – is a process that seems inevitable and irreversible, but at the same time carries all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
When places full of history and memories disappear, "it's like a friend going away, a friend we've shared our journey with and many experiences," says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which marks twenty years ago the Oscar award and the Grand Prix of the Cannes Festival to Tornator, tells the lyrical story of a small town cinema, the craving, after a movie experience that may have been lost forever.
The largest association of operators, Anec, figures that speak clearly: in the past five years 316 traditional film theaters have closed.The biggest losses have been recorded in the cinemas in major cities: 10 film theaters closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin, and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions is Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 single-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And that it is precisely the proliferation of the multiplex that is responsible for their disappearance, we do not prove better than that Italy has the highest number of newly opened multi-room cinemas in these three regions: in the last five years the number of rooms has increased by 195 in Lombardy, by 81 in Tuscany and equally in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says Paolo Protti, chairman of Anec. "It's okay to build new facilities, but the survival of those already existing should also be ensured, because when a city cinema closes, not every entrance is willing to move to the multiplex.
Not to mention the unpaid financial funds intended to support operators: the state’s outstanding debt can be approximately 10 million euros.
It is also ethically and morally shameful that the government does not comply with the laws in force.
It would require 16 to 18 million euros per year to maintain the market.”
Particular attention is paid to the case of Bologna. This is the first Italian city that, concerned about closures, has decided to resolve the problem through an agreement between the municipality and Anec in order to protect and boost the single-room cinemas outside and in the city centre.
The provisions would include tax reductions for operators and benefits for the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers would be able to ride into restricted areas and park at a discounted rate in certain parking spaces.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, even with the introduction of other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
But it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to fight the domination of the multiplex, need to improve the quality of sound and image, because today’s audience is much more demanding.
Preserving the traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and youth, gave me the spark that eventually made me Cinema Paradiso, even though I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, so when I walk on the Via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or Quirinale to avoid the dust-blacked posters, I turn my head.
Close ties between politics and 'ndrangheta, arrested Mayor Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in municipal decisions."
Serious charges have been filed by the judges of the Calabria Anti-Mafia Directorate against Mayor and Deputy Mayor Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor Carlo Martelli of Rosarno, who were arrested this morning on charges of external involvement in a criminal coalition.
Bilincs was also placed in the hands of Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior mediator between the clan and the administration, and his cousin, a lawyer with the same name as the boss, who had previously been convicted of participating in a mafia-like criminal coalition, and was charged with €10 million in damages.
“A neglect of all legal and moral rules, including good taste,” the prosecutors wrote.The two local authorities have declared their intention to pay a lawyer’s fee to Piromalli.
“So the clan would have officially had an entrance to the town hall, which would have given an additional opportunity to control and control the administration, which can be said to be significant anyway.
Agazio Loiero, President of the Assembly of the Calabria Region, does not hide that in the region "there are numerous conspiracies between local institutions and the organized underworld": There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where conspiracies are almost inevitable.
Many local politicians, however, resist the pressure of 'ndrangheta, they are the heroes who remain clean."
The arrests this morning are a continuation of the events of July, when police announced that they had succeeded in defeating the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were dismissed from their mandate to administer the municipality.The municipal committee of Gioia Tauro was once dissolved in 1991 due to alleged mergers between organized crime and local authorities.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian-Democratic mayor who ruled at the time of the dissolution, became the head of the center-right coalition in the second round in 2006.
He cried out a scandal when the County House ordered the dissolving of the municipal committee.
He summoned then Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minnini to court, accusing him of planning everything for political purposes, but in the arrest warrant signed this morning, the court explained that the Piromalli clan had dared to demand a change in the A3 project.
According to the prosecutors, the interrogation ordered against Dal Torrione showed that he was "willing to comply with the demands of an entrepreneur representing a large group known to be close to the Piromalli family, subordinating the municipality's decisions to the interests of the clan."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones are coming
An inexhaustible source of energy that accounts for 70 percent of the planet’s surface and is yet to be discovered by major international energy markets.
Waves, ocean currents, floods, all are renewable energy sources that giants like Chevron have been looking at and are now trying to put their hands on it.
For hundreds of years, research has been underway on how to extract energy from the movements of the oceans.In the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
Around 1980, when oil prices fell, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but today the demands of environmental protection and the re-rise in oil prices give the sector a new momentum.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by marine waves.
This is twice as much as what nuclear power plants produce today.
In addition, there would be streams and floods.
The giants are excited.
Enersis was the first company to commit itself to marine energy and in 2005 signed an agreement for a power plant in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signature was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies have opted for marine energy, including those who have so far been dedicated supporters of conventional energy.
“Chevron is studying technologies that leverage the energy of the oceans and is considering working with us,” a spokesman for one of the oil giants’ affiliates told the Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question relates to obtaining a permit issued by the U.S. Energy Commission for the launch of a sea energy project in Alaska.
This is of no minor importance, especially given that the U.S. is producing oil in Alaska, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. in New York and Ocean Power in New Jersey are also pursuing the path of offshore energy.
Technology is waiting to be developed.
Experts say this is still a primitive technology, just because sea energy does not dispel doubts about its environmental impact.
The existing facilities, such as those in Portugal or Scotland, are all small in size and therefore do not pose too many problems for the ecosystem.
However, to produce energy on a larger scale, installations with a greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses an interconnected boar system.
The shocks generated by the waves and moving the boys up and down are converted into hydraulic pressure by the sticks and cylinders placed in them.
The pressure rotates a turbine, which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the land through cables under the sea.
Currently, there are four similar installations in the design phase, which are only waiting for federal permission.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started power generation for a shopping center and a parking lot using six underwater turbines in the East River trail in New York.
During the flow, the movement of the water rotates the turbine's sleeves, and this rotational movement fuels the generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of partners who are only waiting for permits to use the energy.
after the waves.
At present, special attention is paid to the opportunities that can be exploited through the flooding.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, floods are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and are therefore considered to be a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, spent $7.5 million in 2008 to exploit the energy supplied by the storm.
