Populist right triumph in Austria, together they make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have, according to the first approximate results, led to a considerable weakening of both parties in the current grand coalition and a marked strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
The Austrian People's Party (OVP) has suffered heavy and special losses, with the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the Carinthia state government, Jörg Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, thus losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still finished the OVP losing 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the postwar period and especially for the people who called these early elections.
Even in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the Populars had a considerable advantage over the SPO in terms of preference.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results speculation was made about the resignation of the party chairman and, until today, vice-chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be reached by Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
This would obviously facilitate the way to the constant and most approximate starting point of the election results, i.e. the renewal of the grand coalition between the SPO and the OVP.
In view of the reinforcement of both populist right-wing parties - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, 11 percent of the vote - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed fears that the same thing would happen in 1999 when the Populars negotiated with the Populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it was dismembered from BZO) for a coalition government that eventually generated a sanction from the European Union.
This is clearly the stake of Haider, who has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he is already taking up his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party also managed to get into parliament, although it lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly crossed the four percent threshold and therefore, is not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India may cool
If the problem of Czech scientists accused of illegally collecting beetles in India is not solved, Czech-Indian relations could cool, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was the Minister's statement in New York after his meeting today with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this is not resolved then yes, then yes we would certainly reach this cooling", he said after the meeting, which was organized on the initiative of the Czech Republic.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly get involved.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was cleared of charges and fined, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling, which has jurisdiction over the matter.
"Your problem could be solved", said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, the best thing would be, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
He said he could then ask for the case to be dismissed and await the verdict in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"It is advisable to appeal to the High Court and then a pardon would be possible", said the Czech Foreign Minister.
The only way the Czech side can get involved is by getting the convict "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that the Indian side was already getting this kind of support.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it", Schwarzenberg commented.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
"We really consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists", he announced.
The minister evaded an answer to the question of whether he had received from the Indian side a promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I've received quite a few promises", he just said.
A Czech referee fights on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, and it shows Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small lost dot in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as big as a single continent", says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law.
His boss, the Director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this temperament and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
You can find oil and other mineral raw materials, but also organisms that were unknown to us until now, and that themselves hold the key to the development of cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the land
The countries with coastlines have today begun to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
Under the UN Treaty, they are taking advantage of the rights they agreed to in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is basically the so-called Continental Rim which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
The Treaty gives the United Kingdom exclusive rights over all the resources of the Continental Shelf.
"Simply put, continental rim means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent underwater.
It reaches to the edge of the sea coast, and often to the border of 200 nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request for the delimitation of the external borders of the Continental Shelf submitted to the Commission by the country concerned must be accompanied by scientific and technical documentation based on research and measurements.
It is the result of a series of years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist assistance commission.
The Commission has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have made progress", adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a worldwide impact as it was the first to essentially expand its maritime dominion.
But New Zealand has also done it - the seabed area the commission granted it last week is 1.6 million square kilometres, which is almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in his study.
The profit from the use of the seabed will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They may do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
Where the Continental Shelf ends begins the region of the ocean floor declared by the Treaty to be "the common heritage of mankind".
Here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The exploitation rights in these areas are administered by treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is no goldmine", says Director Mikulka emphatically, adding "that its separate zones are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract".
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
The European Union has achieved this in 1991 with a Treaty on Investors, along with a few other states, the so-called "pioneer investor" states.
It has the capability to explode in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it's something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"A surface area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concreteness.
It reminds us of a little potato or a little fantasy, the Shem, who according to legend revived the Golem.
During the hostage rescue, German special forces command was on the scene.
To solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are being revealed about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
Thus at the place of release were specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, air squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation as well as experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As ministry spokesmen reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because the kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted German help to use it as a support on the spot.
"Fortunately, that moment did not come", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of travellers consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian woman and 8 Egyptian companions.
After the abduction in the desert region of southern Egypt the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the people who were saved, safe and sound, arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He didn't say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return in Airbus of the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The US House of Representatives does not approve the bailout package
The upper house of the United States Congress barely let a big $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets fail.
The Dow Jones has fallen very sharply.
The United States House of Representatives rejected by 227 votes to 206 the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all appeals from President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, he did not reach a majority for a program that should limit the disorder in the financial markets.
With dramatic action the desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the grand $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the Democratic negotiating leader had asked the congressmen to vote on the plan, although it's not as popular.
"It is difficult to get political approval to avoid something that has not yet absolutely happened", he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to over 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investor concerns that the state bailout package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the defeat was made public, he fell again.
Experts expect other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
To put the programme into effect, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The organizers report an increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organisers:
According to one study, the volume of sales of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared with last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakening economic situation, the desire of Germans to travel remains the same.
As reported on Monday by the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent higher compared to the same period last year.
According to the research of the market research institute GfK, the number of reserves for the autumn months had already increased.
Thus the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent higher compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The results are based on GfK figures which are the information analysed on bookings at 1200 travel agencies and calculated for approximately the whole market.
The data collected are travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened dollar, travel to the United States is in high demand, DRV reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased by almost a third.
The preferred destinations of Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are highly preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices are rising, in this case the travel expenses are 'better calculated for the customer than during an individual trip'.
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months, travel was well booked, so that the volume of sales compared to last year rose again - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, compared to last year, fell.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the open-air parties at the endless Spa, beer in one-litre jars and famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Actually, Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She's blonde, the TV host and wears a custom Bavarian traditional costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: as soon as we are in the tent, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with photos - it is very flattering especially because it is my first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Bavarian traditional costume seems to be doing its job.
Actually as a tourist at Oktoberfest from northern Germany my feeling of well-being in traditional Bavarian attire to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa, it's not all that much.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian costume or leather pants; none seem to be noticing or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A Munich woman draws my attention to my apron which I had dressed in the wrong way: "the left part is single, half is virgin, the right part is engaged, behind is widow".
Oh, God, now I'm backing up to the left.
"All right", he says with a laugh.
Others do not care much for the subtle methods of flirting and wear hats that say "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking, their naked ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is called Bob, he's from England and he's also at the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He thinks it's "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
He tells me after he's put aside his glass of a pint of beer he just drank.
He put it right next to the fire hydrant, most people think that's a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those famous people who can drink a lot.
The others are not so lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
Around 8:00 p.m. the sanitation groups run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunkards.
The toilets appear in groups every time - suddenly there are always four people bringing the covered walkways from one tent to the other.
That's how it works with most visitors: they come in sober, they come back drunk.
You don't see who's suffering from the degrees of alcoholism and is on the aisles.
"They are the ones who can't take it anymore", a sanitarian answered my question and disappeared in a tumult.
Police identified accident victim
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road, in the town of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He's since been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey even tried to join the European Union, the European powers were keen to penetrate into the country.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 paces into Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, that's what the guides say.
The building is set to the end of the platforms and has two towers in front, one for each corner, all resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in your complex is a little decayed.
But once it overtook the vaulted locker, there was no doubt whatsoever of the greatness of the enterprise that this was the most westerly door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer to the imperial game, had ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that stretched to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond into what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Their railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has led to the fall of the
British rule and as forces advanced into Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for the station in Hyderpasha as well.
In 1917 a train of munitions exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was sabotage.
Since then the station has been declining and has been left out of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and to all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to underline Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there's a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish government has excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I climbed into a bunk and went to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the AKP leaders, an expert in foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a rocky journey, which produced the old world cadence in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to govern a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigmatic change in the Turkish consensus.
That has raised some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and "power bakeries" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet early in the morning to make deals/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its internal relations.
Today you must look at the same time to the East and the West.
It's not a case if it's not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point", I ask, "Turkey might be forced to choose?"
"Turkey", he replies, "does not want to face that choice".
I would like to stress one point which almost everyone I have spoken to up to now has recited almost by heart: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East but with the Caucasus region and the whole Black Sea region are a benefit to Europe and the United States as well as to Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically set up those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after a second sleepless night, my thoughts turn to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had witnessed the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How surprised would you have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East would now largely be in the hands of Turkey?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe".
So there is little doubt as to which continent this fascinating country should claim.
Lives to Remember by Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (left, 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for under-21, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were finishing in our 20s - we just refuse to go all the way to the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape-shifter) represented the choir's willingness and ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, whether unaccompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this choir of youths was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He'd say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
That's all you have to do!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never imposing, nor too florid.
Whatever the musical score, it always ended up on a higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed over 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never, by any, been disappointed  otherwise, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two war horses very well known throughout the world".
We'll miss him very much.
I 'm not sure .
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25), you state that "in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford and in 1950 won a Houblon-Norman research fellowship... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate".
This is learned from a note by Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years 1950-51 in the United States, enjoying a scholarship from Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
I was impressed by their simplicity and the strength they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments".
Second round for the Honda superselling
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a large living space, this new monovolume has an even larger interior space.
In addition, refined mechanics increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
So is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz is aesthetically very similar to the current model, the changes introduced in this car are numerous.
Among others, an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analysing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation was introduced on the market.
The Commission therefore concluded that the Commission did not have sufficient evidence to support the claim that the Commission did not provide any evidence that the Commission had failed to take into account the findings of the investigation.
Although in Europe, the Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and again in 2008.
In Japan alone, nearly a million Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with around half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends that this new Jazz will allow to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would represent a 17% growth in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz since 2002, which represents 6,7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish subsidiary hopes to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand expects to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda is relying on the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a compact, five-door hybrid - 4.37 meters in length - that the Japanese company expects to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By market and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be split between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned for the first months of the year, once its presentation in society is made in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its shares.
Its length rises to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes to 2.50 meters, which is an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the central fuel tank, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
The capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - also rises to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the capacity of the first-generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measurements are of the 1.4 engine version, as the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines in this second generation Jazz are also new.
At the start of its commercialisation, this small model will have two 1.2- and 1.4-litre petrol engines.
Both engines incorporate i-VTEC technology, which achieves lower fuel consumption, less carbon dioxide emissions, excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time high torque throughout the engine.
The first 1.2 litre mechanical unit produces 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 revolutions.
This engine - which previously produced 78 horsepower in Jazz - has a power consumption of 5.3 litres and an emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
The previous generation had 83 horsepower, but now it's 100.
This 100-horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, in particular by bees.
A Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, general director of public relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an expansion of Nissan's four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to enhance the collision prevention capability of the brand's vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space that is very similar to Nissan's Safety Shield.
But most importantly, the bee's compound eyes, capable of seeing at an angle of over 300 degrees in all directions, allow it to fly uninterrupted within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles up to two metres away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor, which immediately results in collision prevention.
"The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a right or greater angle to avoid a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is that the evasive maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned up or down, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, to prevent collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It requires no storing information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can run continuously with only a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megas".
This is the first step in developing new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced in production cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the lithium ion variety.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to their destination while avoiding obstacles on the way.
Shake before you mortgage
It must be admitted that the U.S. Treasury Department, besides having plenty of liquid to inject, is not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages at banks of questionable solvency, they have created a fun and informative browser game: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the Hotel of bad credit... or of mess.
The sad aspect of this accommodation and especially of your receptionist is to think once, twice and even three times if it is time to ask for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it, which is probably their goal.
It is true that you have useful information, but it is not very detailed.
It's more of a teenage site than a general audience site.
What happens if the game is completed?
Well, there's a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because if we buy a better house and we don't talk...
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21 percent of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock market share.
A week after discovering a provisional agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9 percent of Morgan Stanley's common stock at a price per unit of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities which will ensure a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall transaction would be based on a unit price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28 per cent above its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley stock was losing 6.79% to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status", explained Juan Mack, the CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new charter last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but he's putting it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
"A week ago", explained Toshihide Mizuno, the CEO of MUFG, in Tokyo, "we thought the stake would have been made up of ordinary shares only.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we have wanted to minimise the risks and to cover ourselves".
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7 % below their book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of earnings per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares within one year if these are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 or more, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, declined to give details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier 1 solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan needed to have a lot of relief on his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been exhausting for the group, which saw its stock market share fall by half while the cost of security against a risk of default on its debt skyrocketed.
This cost was falling last Monday but was still at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
This Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, is the third time that a draft new Constitution has been put to a vote.
Mission accomplished as 64% of the electorate voted "yes" to the referendum, according to the official results which referred to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" party got 28%, 7%, void and 0,7% blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, he had to get half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two exit polls and a count by an NGO announced a broad "yes" victory, estimating it at between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly", he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who head the government in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chavez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in complete calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), were based on a 444-point text that consolidated the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
The draft Constitution implies increasing the power of the state over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially on oil extraction by foreign companies and on foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the bill also grants reinforced powers to the head of state, who can serve up to two consecutive four-year terms each and has the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50 % of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
19 abductees released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were abducted ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been liberated by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good when they arrived at 3:30 p.m. aboard a special plane at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical tests, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying an all-terrain safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since moved from one Zulu to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of organising the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, transported aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled", said the official, who remained anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces unit "lightning" were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commandos.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by the secret agents and by members of the Italian special forces.
"We have to recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men from the secret services, from the special forces", he declared without going into details.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The Sudanese army said on the eve of the attack that it had intercepted an all-terrain vehicle carrying the hijackers, killing six of them, including the Chadian chief, and arresting two others.
He also claimed that they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Unity Movement (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture has made headlines and is currently dominating the election campaign.
It's better this way.
But one aspect of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums given to the small museums, archives, archaeological digs or national historical sites that are starving?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don't we have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage like in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government is devoting three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only Chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the American people and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and all of this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40 000 benevolent people grouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with looking into history, preserving with little money heaps of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when developers and managers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a monument to history and heritage?
The Dutch governments nationalise part of Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - the first in Europe - will help with the nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which is in difficulty due to the effects of the mortgage crisis on the North American market: the three countries will support this financial and insurance institution with a total of 11.2 billion euros, which also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at the highest level with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner responsible for economic competition.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the euro area crisis in the context of the international financial crisis which has been occurring in several waves for over a year, so the decisions taken with regard to the Bank can in a sense be regarded as precedents.
According to the decision taken early Sunday morning, the three states will buy about half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a part of its business, including mainly the insurance activities purchased last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis' shares started a strong decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees this bank is too big to allow itself to fail.
The company's stock fell 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Looking at the current share prices, the total value of the group's capital on the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to company executives this is not real.
The Bank's management attributed the sharp fall in Fortis' shares to the uncertainties of the North American market in connection with the approval of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday the shares showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has made a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they would not have to worry, they would not lose their money.
The Bank's customers have so far not panicked, they have not invaded the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when they see the data on a drug purchase.
Privacy policy experts fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which link the use of prescription data in all cases to the approval of the person concerned.
It must be in independent hands, because otherwise, "we're leaving the chicken coop to the fox", - quotes the Washington Post from Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the price of the insurance and the amount of compensation depend on the health status of the client and if they think the risk is excessive, they just don't make the contract.
They sent the client to a medical check-up and signed the contract with him, knowing the result of the check-up.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: with the customer identification number he easily gets from the pharmacies the list of medicines bought in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the client's diseases and health status.
For example, if you consistently take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is practically incurably high, so you are immediately placed in a higher risk category.
There are numerous versions of the programme, some even setting a risk number, so that the insurance company has little to do besides the administration, although there are some minor difficulties in this respect.
Among the disadvantages of the programme is that some medicines are multi-use, for example certain substances are used both to treat headaches and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk-increasing factor for insurance companies whereas the former is not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process these data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the patient's approval.
The authorities are already forcing them to do this, although they have not received a fine for negligence so far.
Some companies are also now compiling the results of laboratory tests and combining them with data on drug use to obtain more accurate information on the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and at the same time it is becoming more and more difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The bill giving the authority the right to control companies specialized in the supply of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard recognises that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his programme, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that the person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, after all, are exposed to the goodwill of the fox.
The overall menu of Marseille
The European Union doubles trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutual trading partners, this issue, along with other largely global issues, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A French-Indian summit will also be held today, to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a major developing democratic power that should have more say in international affairs, the member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This question has not been discussed at the ninth summit which began yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President-in-Office, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Javier Solana, the chief foreign policy official, received Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double their trade in five years, i.e. to more than 100 billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
The 26 existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India were thus legally harmonised, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is balance, because while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth trading partner of the Union.
The summit turned its attention to global affairs.
Both sides condemned the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism - in all its forms - and called for the urgent convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalization was also pressed, although both sides bear a great deal of responsibility for its failure.
The EU confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least twenty per cent.
India also agrees with this, as at the climate conference next year, a global agreement should be reached and the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
They also want to prevent the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the Indian Prime Minister will travel to the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive contracts worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to welcome more than 7 000 exhibitors from 102 different countries, who will occupy the 171,790 square metres of the exhibition with more than 403 000 titles on display and with Turkey as the guest of honour.
The Italian government will be represented by the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, Francisco Maria Giro, at the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square metres of exhibition space.
A meeting with the press will follow in the Struktur Room in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
The figures show that the share of books by foreign authors in total Italian production, particularly for adults and adolescents, is declining.
Found the plane of Steve Fossett the millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The wreckage of the plane belonging to Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3rd, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris has been found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters in the Mammoth Lakes Nevada Range, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson has dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have confirmation that it is the same plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance", he said at a press conference.
The Commissioner has stated that no human remains have been found on or around the plane.
The 63-year-old millionaire was presumed dead in February.
The American Transportation Safety Bureau (TSB) has announced that a few hours after the remains were spotted, a team of investigators was sent to identify the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal remains were found by a couple near his Mammoth Lakes home.
It's two documents in Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
The search for Fossett had been discontinued a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete a round-the-world flight in a hot air balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, I had made the world tour by plane and without stops.
Among his records, there is also that of flying at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
An off-the-charts Suv with an original, well-established design with defined lines and determined angles.
This is, in summary, the last born among the "compact" all-terrain vans of the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Due to the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that accompanied the launch of the Glk suv, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the central street of the Milanese shopping, avenue Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed in the avenue Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images, you will get the impression that the car is coming out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be reconstituted into a single image.
No doubt Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication with this advertisement.
Will this formula be able to capture the interest of future buyers?
It's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sporting events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group which has been following the Italian National for years and which, to tell the truth, has never created too many problems.
And they'd never met the rival's fans either.
Group extraction is right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
A small group (few units, really) from Campania and Apulia has been added to these in Sofia.
They have three-colored flags showing the militants' hometown: Saturday night they were taken out so they could not be identified.
They inspire the English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, the Levski.
The FICC had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all already with names, so easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already checked them all: among those who had gone to Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none who had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a record of stadium crime, have been denied their tickets and also their travel.
Now the Ministry of the Interior is waiting to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) which prevents people from attending not only Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, they'll never set foot in a stadium again.
Good luck with that!
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others be added.
"We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way", they say of the Ministry of the Interior.
That is why, "eyes wide open" especially in view of Wednesday's National match in Lecce".
In Apulia there is also a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams which can also have a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, that is the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The choruses of Duce-Duce and the raised arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...".
This is the thought (expressed in an unfortunate way) of Domenico Mazzilli, who has been director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior for a few weeks now (he has taken the position previously held by Francesco Tagliente and then by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been Trieste's head of public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behaviour of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist", adds the Observatory's No. 1, "the crimes are attributed to the countries in which they occur.
So far this group has behaved well. Now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles to the Mameli anthem: those too are not a crime, but if they allow it they are not of education either...
