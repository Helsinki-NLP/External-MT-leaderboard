Parliament rejects amendment to release Tymoshenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine in the course of amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code rejected an attempt to cancel the article, according to which the opposition leader, Yulia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would lead to the release of the former prime minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the bill on mitigating sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be unprofitable.
The verdict is not final; the court will consider Tymoshenko’s appeal in December.
Tymoshenko claims that the sentence is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the process was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, according to which the former prime minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to be ratified.
Victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya already has losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert.
It is time to determine the winners.
As a rule, Islamists are the winners in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The transitional government has declared itself a follower of the ordinary law of Sharia, which we have already heard of.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the punishment for theft is the cutting off of the hand.
Women may forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society of competing clans will be united by the Qur’an.
There will be an order in Libya that we can’t imagine, and we’re unlikely to want.
In any case, our way of life is neither the only one of its kind nor the best and probably would not be suitable, for example, for the people of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have received help from non-believers.
Their only excuse is that, in their opinion, NATO attacks were not led by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they praised after every strike.
And if you are looking for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We took part in shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of profit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not need to worry about the expulsion of the “cruisers.”
Although without the occupation, will oil companies get Libya’s black gold for virtually no price?
And then the West will finally be able to boast of the unselfish protection of civil rights.
Unless the followers of Sharia will stop this.
A new wave of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are now the focus of investors.
Statistical storm hit Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries released GDP data for the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnant, with Germany and France showing growth.
Today, the debt market is breaking records.
Investors are already looking not only to Italy; now they have focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
Eurozone statistics offices in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by 0.5% and France by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany was doing better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the initial 0.1%).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was in a stagnant state, according to the Czech Statistical Bureau, this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts predicted.
The key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was stagnant compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany’s economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Between July and September, the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union grew by 0.2% compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with the forecasts of analysts.
The Greek economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
The yield of its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The yields of both Italian and Spanish bonds are approaching a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Despite the worsening situation in the region, the yield of Czech 1-year bonds remains around 4%.
In Germany, they say that the ECB is the last lender that can save the situation.
The Czech national team was selected for Euro.
In Montenegro, they won 1:0 and are celebrating an unexpected prize of 200 million.
The national team successfully dealt with the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful goal of Peter Yiraček they won with the score of 1:0.
In the second half, the Czech team was lucky to retain a significant advantage after a home match, and it will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz monitored the course of the match and compiled a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first half and great luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Yiraček; won 1:0 in Montenegro and is celebrating entry to the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the Montenegro team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damyanovich and Vučić became the most unsuccessful pair of the match after missing two great opportunities.
The magnificent Peter Czech is one of the reasons that the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year.
The game was very tense from the first minutes.
Both teams had difficulty performing combinations; the game most of the time was in the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the host team in the first half. Further strikes over the line of defense were carefully intercepted by the Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have built a living shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
Thus, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday at noon, students prayed before entering the building, followed by a prayer about the destruction of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students set up a living shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
Thus, they demonstrated a willingness to protect their country’s nuclear program at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that everything indicates that Iran has not stopped trying to acquire nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday at noon, students prayed before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant, followed by a prayer about the destruction of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximum paralysis of the Iranian nuclear program, the targets will, according to the Israeli press, be installations in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Nutrition for Obese Children: No Breakfast and Cake for Dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% suffer from obesity.
According to the latest study, children suffering from obesity usually come from families leading an unhealthy lifestyle.
We once again see the importance of the environment and patterns of behavior that accompany a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage appears on the tables of children suffering from obesity, almost twice as often as in families with children with a normal weight.
More than 19% of obese children ate fries for dinner on the eve of a survey related to an educational event called Obesity is not a coincidence.
Moreover, families of children suffering from obesity do not play sports.This, however, applies to most families of modern schoolchildren - only 15% of children said their parents find time to play sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last school year, involving almost 900 elementary schoolchildren across Bohemia.
The event Obesity is not a coincidence was held for the second consecutive year, with the support of the insurance company Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna and the company Unilever.
To date, more than 12 thousand pupils from 4 to 8 classes have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and adequate exercise are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either overweight or obesity.
“For example, only half of the respondents said that they eat five times a day, according to the breakfast-breakfast-lunch-breakfast-dinner scheme, but this is one of the indispensable conditions for proper nutrition,” one of the findings of the study said.
No lunch or sausage in the evening.
Experts warn that even such relative details as the constant time of family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school families eat breakfast together.
Most families eat breakfast separately.
The worst discovery was that in one in ten families people don’t eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The study found that fried food is more commonly consumed in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweetened refrigerated drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40% of children regularly engage in sports, this figure decreases more than twice – to 15% – when it comes to their parents.
Create your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to make their own menu based on the proposed foods and based on their tastes and preferences.
“The food preferences of Czech children aged 12-15 are far from ideal when it comes to healthy eating.”
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
“Special concern is the great popularity of sweetened refrigerated beverages,” says the final part of the study.
As the main meal, the pasta defeated the bird with a small predominance.
However, the children practically showed no interest in beans, fish and vegetable dishes.
Desire for a Healthy Lifestyle
The study also found that children are willing to change their eating habits provided they are given appropriate information.
“Many participants in the study’s control group showed a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they filled out a questionnaire after the end of the lecture Obesity is not a coincidence,” the project said.
This was especially noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet refrigerated drinks – more children began to prefer them to just water.
In addition, as the main meal, children were more likely to mark poultry and fish, limiting the amount of sweet dishes and baked meals.
A stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article on training for stylists, I attended the volume of information on the introductory classes.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures from three experts in the field; advice on choosing clothes for non-standard figures; and a workshop on how all this works in real life.
Next is more.
The closer we are to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
Training is held every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really full of information.
This time with Alenka, the director, we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One has a short neck, the other has a boy's figure without proper shapes, another weighs more than normal.
A stylist should know how to visually reduce wide shoulders, extend the neck or add missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to emphasize the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. holders of lighter breasts and hips and narrow waist, and at the same time not dress them too challengingly.
For example, if the difference in the volume of the waist and hips is so large that you can not pick up a shirt or pants, it is worth having at least one thing sewn on order.
You will definitely not regret the money invested, because perfectly seated clothes are invaluable.
In a shirt sewn on custom, you will feel much better than in one that is constantly climbing, hanging, revealing the waist, etc.
Owners of boy figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with rushes, application, tail or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and the types of figures, I’m glad that I have a whole week to realize it all.
And yet, I’m afraid, that’s too much given the homework we got.
Each participant had to come up with two dresses for a celebrity: for the day and for the evening.
We should consider their modern appearance, their style in clothes and the type of figure.
I’m going to wear Miranda Kerr, who you may know from Victoria’s Secret advertising campaigns.
I’m happy about myself because it’s much easier to wear it than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently recovered (please keep in mind that I’m exaggerating), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut out clothes from magazines or find them on the Internet, print them out and process them with graphic programs.
Moodboard - so called the result of work - then reflects our own style and attitude to graphic image.
It is important to keep in mind the graphic component of style.
A stylist does not just dress real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special guidelines, such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
This is what stylist and designer Mario Kamenich told us.
But it was only on Sunday.
Stylists need general knowledge.
The Saturday lecture, full of information on the types of figures, was revived by three guests - specialists in this field.
Stylist, Honza Pokorny; fashion designer, Yakub Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Ranch.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist must use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a trench coat can be worn in the usual way, above jeans and t-shirts, like a coat; but it can also be worn on the naked body, without clutches, like a dress.
Another option is to roll your sleeves or raise your collar, and the whole image is completely changed.
“Play with him,” he said.
Anyway, I most appreciated the following advice: “For your work, you need to know the rules perfectly.”
Then you can start breaking them,” Jacob told us.
Here I finally understood why we get all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see quite differently.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, a photographer, I learned that a stylist should have more options of costumes than the number of photos he needs to take.
So, for a fashion review on ten pages (equivalent to ten dresses) I must be prepared to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture, the object of the clothes often looks and works in combination with others at all not like in reality.
We have to keep this in mind when creating an image.
Honza Pokorna confirmed that often image and style are half of success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn’t have a stunning vocal, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude to the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even famous people often consider this superfluous (and believe that it is enough to be an expert in something, and how they look is secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to call us a different (less) size than the one they actually wear.
Then we turn to Google and find out if the tabloids did not write anything about that some celebrity was fattened / lost weight, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it was not enough for a stylist to understand fashion and be able to pick up a suit.
Our work mainly consists of communicating with the people we dress; so it’s important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not offend them and stick to their opinion.
“If a manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can’t throw out her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are awful.”
"Find at least a few things you can praise and advise what you can wear with them," says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what a work bag should fit.
This is a bag that you tie around your waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things such as scissors, sticky rolls or English sticks, it should have a nylon thread (stylists use it when shooting certain objects, such as a bag or hat), special clips for sticking the fabric on the back in case the clothes are too large (stickers and similar items are prohibited because they spoil the clothes) or a sewing kit.
In order to get distracted from lectures and gain some practical experience, we learned how to properly make shoe pads.
Even during shooting in a studio where the floor is smooth, the helmets can get damaged – not to mention shooting outdoors.
And here we did the crawl.
You should not touch the shoes with scissors, so as not to spoil them.
This requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
I did not like those skills.
This is just part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend courses.
I’m beginning to realize that being a professional stylist isn’t as easy as you might say.
Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Review of
What was supposed to be a careless walk turned into a routine morning trip to work due to a series of completely inappropriate and negligent mistakes.
The ambitions were satisfied to a certain extent, but it doesn’t matter because nobody obviously wanted to do the extra work.
Before the release of the new version with the subtitle "Flight" connected great hopes.
It was expected to shift the previous series of Need for Speed in a new direction; demonstration versions testified that the game would take a worthy place in the genre of racing games.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the protagonist gets out of the car and runs away.
As is often the case with NFS, the outcome is much different from what we expected.
The game is a fairly good arcade race, but the overall impression is ruined by a few unnecessary mistakes that are present in this series of games for several years.
So, in reality, this is not a mistake, but a manifestation of the inexplicable laziness of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You become part of a story whose main character, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race across America.
You get into a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to get to New York first.
This idea has several interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race runs on its own route, individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
Therefore, there is no feeling that the same thing is happening all the time in the game.
Despite the fact that the graphics are at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some tracks are pleasant to watch.
And yet the game does not cause strong emotions.
While driving a car through the desert, through the autumn suburbs or high in the snowy mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, the race occasionally revives an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert you get into a sandstorm, which significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you need to be careful not to fall under the avalanche.
The individual races are quite well arranged.
There are only a few varieties, but that is enough.
For a while you’re trying to overtake several rivals (essentially a regular race); then you’re trying to improve the time (standard secondary race); or you’re competing with one opponent.
Among other things, you occasionally encounter the police, which makes your task even more complicated.
The components on the outside of the car are new.
It’s just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
Although surprisingly, these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (only three to be precise).
In fact, it turns out to be good for the game because this property isn’t boring; considering all of the above, it’s one of the things that makes the game more fun.
The racing model follows the tracks of previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a disadvantage.
If you are looking for a real-life imitation, you will have to look elsewhere.
And yet this driving model is very suitable for dynamic races, although better options can be found on the market.
So far everything is very well.
However, after some time problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
From such a game you do not expect complicated transformations and collisions, but if you have no idea before a collision with an object, how your car will behave, something is wrong.
Usually, by overtaking or passing by cars in a dense stream, you sometimes slightly touch another car.
Or broke up.
It’s not so important because of the restart system, but it’s enough to ruin the fun.
The restarts are arranged in such a way that if you crash or get away from the track, the game brings you back to the point where it was interrupted.
However, there are only five restarts available for each race.
If you use them all, you will have to start the race from the beginning.
This is useful if something doesn’t work out, but you can’t fully rely on it.
Sometimes restarts are not enough, and you have to learn a separate section of the race.
An important disadvantage of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be done in a certain way, otherwise you just won’t fit.
In other cases, you encounter civilian cars in a particular location in the same configuration regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see your opponent easily passing between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you get there, the cars are already arranged so that you need to either circumvent them or lower speed.
It doesn’t matter when you find yourself next to them; everything is arranged so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors have other advantages.
During the game you discover several locations where, regardless of time, the same opponent outputs you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you are driving in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent has to stand up before you no matter what.
The fact is that when it runs in front of you, it makes your view worse, leading to one or more accidents on that site.
You can understand an attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but this is so obvious that it quickly begins to irritate.
It’s a pity, because despite the simple driving model, the game is fun and sometimes so full of events that you don’t have time to pay attention to what’s happening around you.
It doesn’t matter what doesn’t get you bored – a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races or something else.
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual.
You need to track the gas stations along the way, as it is on them that your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is quite enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars – for straight sections of the highway; and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain trails.
The main story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; it is racing on individual areas that you will learn in the course of the game.
Here you win for your personal cause both medals and points, common to the challenges and story modes.
Many options are available to get a higher level of driving: starting with cars and ending with profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the Autolog online feature, which, among other things, compares your results with the results of other players, and provides communication with the public.
Here’s another disadvantage, hard to understand; it’s an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car get into the subway tunnel (we’ll think so), where you’re rushing along the rails in the dark (we’ll think so).
Your speed meter shows numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (think it is) when a subway train suddenly hits you from behind, turning your car into a pile of debris.
For several days, our editors discussed whether no one really thought a second during the creation of the game, or whether its creators really think of us as such bats.
The technical component of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video game is mostly pleasant, sometimes even stunning.
Although it is a pity that at some critical moments the quality of recording, sometimes quite strongly, decreases.
This is especially true of events with a large number of participants, where a good recording would not help you too.
Sound is fine; the soundtrack is for the amateur.
In order to please the widest possible youth audience, the soundtrack has included compositions of different styles; but it is unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: Escape is quite messy.
If the game avoided obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves a feeling of incomplete.
Of course, this is good entertainment, but be prepared for the fact that the shortcomings will blind you like the airport projectors.

Ambassador to the European Union:
The Czechs have a reputation for being unwelcome and skeptical of the euro.
“The Lisbon Treaty has caused considerable disagreements between the individual organizations.”
“I did not expect such a cruel war.”
"It will take five or six years before the situation at least somehow stabilizes, calms down and all players get used to their new roles," EU ambassador Milena Witsenova began her lecture at the law school.
She proved how much she adheres to her motto "Clearly and openly about Europe" in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and the relationship between them so simply and clearly that many lecturers from the KU Law School would envy.
Moreover, Vicenova praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
“First, critics said he’s an ordinary gray office mouse that can’t perform any role; I have to say, everyone was amazed at how well he did with his role.”
“He is a man who can listen to twenty-seven member countries at the same time, communicate well with them, and who has a clear idea of which direction the EU should develop.”
She explained her new position as Representative for International Affairs and Security as a response to the question: “Who is the European Union? what number should I call?”; i.e. as an important step towards unifying and increasing transparency of the Union’s policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one is going to ban our cheeses.
Vicenova further focused on the programme that is key for the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the Czech Presidency of the previous year a successful one.
The Czechs were dealing with the imminent financial crisis; they overcame the crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership summit.
She said the resignation of the government at the time was a negative phenomenon that caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
Czech representatives in the EU are currently very busy.
As the ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis caused the ongoing fermentation.
In addition, a new seven-year EU budget needs to be adopted, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be scarce and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which less; all these questions are in the upcoming program.
The ambassador recalled the key slogans she brought to Brussels: “On Europe, in a language understood.”
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheeses.”
It will also make more effective use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe is our future
The ambassador argues that the Czechs are considered to be eurosceptics; as well as people who note the negative rather than the positive side of things.
She wants more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are to blame for this: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful Presidency of the Czech Republic, she noted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
“Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and a Slovak joins us, the French next to me says, ‘Hey, what about the assembly, again the Visegrad Group?’ and he is not happy with that.’
In the future, the Union of Vicenov expects mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policy of the member states.
Compared to the new European Federation, the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe is more realistic.
“We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone.
“We have a Schengen area, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation.”
“For the first time, it was said that countries that want to unite, while those that don’t want to stay aside.”
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe," Vitsenova expects.
In this regard, she emphasized the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the rule that all matters affecting the EU as a whole should be discussed by all member countries, not just those in the eurozone.
History of Brand:
IBM is entering the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find the word that best expresses IMB’s strategy, the closest one will probably be “long-lived.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The longevity of the company was laid down by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson the Elder.
He believed in his motto that many world problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the life of the future giant unfolded (as well as the title of his internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of the corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means constantly moving towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, even though it was not afraid to change everything around it.
During our first hundred years, it has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
Over the next hundred years, we hope to even more,” said Samuel J. Palmizano, the company’s current CEO, on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complicated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care just like Bath in the Czech Republic – IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated system of bonuses for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
IBM’s long-term relationship with consumers is equally advanced.
From the very beginning, the company has found a brilliant application for talented people.It was one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, giving it a great choice.
It is consistent with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan under which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She worked at IBM for thirty years; now she is the Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
Over the past few years, IBM has been organizing meetings, online brainstormings, during which many future innovations are emerging.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - the company employs about half a million people.
Organization with a good reputation
The strong position of the company in the business is provided by a strong internal and external image.
“From the very beginning, from the concept point of view, IBM was more of an organization than a technology company,” said Rosabeth Moss Canter, a Harvard Business School professor and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” adds Joe Coloney of Forrester Research.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
Over the course of a hundred years, IBM, or the “Blue Giant” as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnologies.
It holds the largest number of patents among all U.S. technology companies, with five of its employees winning the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include, for example, a ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a barcode and a discet.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM this year became the second largest technology company (first place for Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking forward
For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online service; and IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is determined by moving forward, you can’t be emotionally attached to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That’s why IBM makes it easy to lay the foundations on multiple platforms – if they don’t work, it’s giving up on them.
This distinguishes it, for example, from its competitor Microsoft, which is based and experiencing falls on Windows, its operating system.
Prospective technology
The main revenue of IBM comes from services, about one-fifth in each case comes from computer programs and hardware.
While in 1990, with half the capital, it was the strongest equipment manufacturer.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion in low-profit assets, while investing $58 billion in future technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the amount of investment during the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM has not hurt the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM’s shares has risen by a record 120 percent; the company’s net earnings have been steadily rising.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything except its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
IBM’s history: from the cheese knife to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago. Its original name "Corporation of Computing, Tabulation, Record" was quite complicated.
It was named IBM in 1924 and was originally the name of a brand used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were laid by the merger of four companies, the history of which begins in the 1880s.
They possessed technologies such as the legendary "table clock", i.e. clocks that record the time when employees come and leave work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also headed the board of trustees of the company until 1930.
Flint hired the company’s competitor, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
Then the manager pushed IBM founder into the shadow – Watson’s ideas remain the basis of unwavering corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production and sale of various equipment for business - from cheese knives and meat cuts to cash machines.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, revenue doubled to $9 million, and the company began to expand on all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his place in the chair of director was taken by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began developing artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM employees and computers helped NASA to control space flights — to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 — human flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of that time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, at the same time buying the consulting division PricewaterhouseCoopers, thereby fully concentrating on consulting and high value-added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has achieved great success with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to make intelligent use of technology in areas where this has not yet been planned, and to improve road conditions and urban governance.
In the field of commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In former Czechoslovakia, the first country to be located simultaneously in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM founded its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also runs a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where a world-class speech recognition research team also works.
Richards about her false husband:
I need it, I don’t need it anymore!
Darina Richtarzhova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Joseph Richarge (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and go home.
However, she no longer wants to wait, and has set clear rules for her future life.
“Pepa may be back home, but not as my partner anymore,” she said.
When Darina Richarzhova provided Bartoshova with shelter in her home in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Ivetta to leave Rzichan 30 days later, Peppa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After some time, Darina gave up, pretending to have accepted her husband's novel; and now she finally said goodbye to him.
Richard doesn’t care who his wife is sleeping with.
Even if one day Richarge and Bartoshova break up, his wife will not receive him with open arms.
“He’s the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, nobody will drive him out.”
"H, he will end his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as a man with whom something binds me," she said, adding that she had already freed her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
So far Joseph has nothing against his wife’s rejection.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I’ll be with Ivetta, I’m not going to change that.”
“My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision.”
“Our alliance still works; I’m responsible for repair, garden, home and shopping.”
“Darina and I communicate perfectly normally, only we don’t share the bed anymore,” Richard told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richardshev finds a new love, he won’t bother her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, with whom and whether she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Yveta and I’m fully responsible,” Joseph concluded.
Worst Women’s Habits: Are They Affecting You?
When you ask men to name some typical female bad habits, they usually list them all right away.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines describing some of the female habits that make men angry?
Shopify
Does your partner complain that you are constantly shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like to shop at big sales?
If so, then your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to somehow control their passion for shopping.
And yet, who of you will give up walking around the clothing stores in search of perfectly seated clothes and sampling it (preferably in different color variants) in samples?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it can be a real hell.
Just remember how many times you have told your other half to wait for you outside.
eternal dissatisfaction
“Am I too fat?”
"I need to lose at least five kilos - maybe I can start doing gymnastics?"
“Are you still attracted to me?”
Do you know these phrases?
Yes is ?
Then you are part of a group of women who are disturbed by their appearance.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men are literally allergic to the constant complaints of their partners about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more often such complaints occur, the more women irritate them.
Most importantly, order and cleanliness.
It is like an endless story.
Washing glass, cleaning with a vacuum cleaner, floor cleaning, dust wiping, bathroom cleaning - at least twice a week.
Are you criticizing your partner for coming on a clean plate in dirty shoes; children for dirt in a clean dishwasher and fingerprints on the window glass in the living room that was so difficult to clean?
If you suffer from this “deviation,” try to realize that falling into extremes is not good; and that in your family order and cleanliness should not be in the first place.
The harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationship as well as the whole family.
Desire to Command
“Put your clothes into the basket.”
“Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?”
Wet towels should not lie on the floor.
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, they may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood this, women’t have to command them so often.
Compounded
Some women like to gossip, insult, and make intrigues against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how and why.
From time to time, each of us breaks out gossip.
Let’s be honest, this seems to be the nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gossipers, women who often gossip and despise others.They, especially in the female workforce, pose a greater danger to their surroundings.
The successful transfers of Jagger and Vorachek helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful transfers by hockey attacker Yaromir Jagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on the ice of Carolina.
In both cases, Claude Giroud used the experience of the thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another transfer and was declared the best player of the match.
Two effective transfers of the match also belonged to the player in the same team with Yagro Yakubu Vorachek.
After the match, Jagger told foreign journalists that he predicted Gira a magnificent evening.
“I told him before the match that he would score a hat-trick.”
“I felt it.”
"Sometimes you feel such things," explained Jagger, after whose actions Giraud scored a goal at the first opportunity given by the Flyers.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a "Czech footprint".
The closing Harrikains Vorachek seized the shadow and handed it over to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the circles.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer reduced the gap with a numerical advantage, but at the beginning of the second half again led the Flyers.
Especially the fat.
After the resultant delivery of Jagger he scored a third goal; later his blow was transformed into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
“I like to play with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," Jagger said, praising his midfielder.
“I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him.”
“It makes me happy.”
“I want to support him.”
“All these years in the NHL, my teammates have tried to help me, and now it’s my turn,” Jagger said.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Rutu and Dwayer's penalties, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications prevented Matt Reid, who increased the gap to two points.
“Proger did a great job in our area.”
“He hit the shark, I accelerated, and Reed moved to the far edge.”
"I targeted him and I am glad that it worked," Voraček described his impression from the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal defender Czech Yaroslav Spatek did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to an injury to the upper body.
Together with the experienced defender, the Canadiens lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalties.
Tomáš Plekánec was unable to score during one of their attacks.
More than the lost points, the home coach was upset by a large number of injury in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
“The situation is bad.”
"We finished the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
“In any case, we can’t do anything about it, we just have to accept it,” said Jacques Martin.
“Replacement for replacement, it was amazing and we couldn’t resist.”
"We needed to simplify the game, move the squad out of our zone."
"What was our weak side," added defender P.K. Subban
After thirty attacks, Czech goalkeeper Onj Pavelec helped Winnipegz defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The goals of Jets, which interrupted a five-match series of defeats, were scored by five different players.
Travel prices since 1989
Before 1989, only five state travel agencies could operate in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
As travel to the West was severely restricted, the travel agencies of the time primarily sold tours to the countries of the Socialist bloc.
Thus, for the holidays, Czech tourists went to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia.The Yugoslav regime then turned to the West, which entailed significant restrictions on Czech tourists' trips to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual trips to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter-invitation from that country was necessary; otherwise individual travel was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered to travel to the West, but you had to either stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or have “good friends” at the agency.
And that was not all.
A currency permit was required for trips to the West.It was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without currency permission it was impossible to obtain cash (Western currency) for travel to the West.
Most often the Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the appearance of a large number of cottages and summer houses, this habit persists to this day.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus experienced a real revolution.
While before 1989 a vacation in the DDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our trips, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we no longer realize is that until 1989 we could not freely visit the most popular Croatia now, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, the need to obtain a visa for neighboring Western European countries was abolished, leading to a huge wave of short trips mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not be saturated with trips to the West. Everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents because their income at the time was not enough for a hotel or guesthouse.
A typical feature of Czech tourism in that period was the desire to bring their own food (conserves, salads, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech krone.After decades, our tourists can finally freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income grew, which around 1997 led to another important circumstance.
Since 1997, the increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights operated by charter airlines. Compared to the past, flights have now become incredibly cheap thanks to the possibility to book wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs did not need a visa to visit virtually all developed countries except the United States.
The next major event in the history of travel after the revolution occurred in 2000.The great demand led to the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have taken Czech tourists to warm exotic countries.This winter, flights from the Czech Republic will depart to twelve exotic destinations.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, occurred in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished the visa requirement for Czech tourists, thus joining the most developed countries of the world forever.
For the first time in history, in 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history they spent more than 15 thousand crowns per person during their holidays abroad, including their expenses at the destination.
The General Assembly Should Choose the President, the Threat of Pata Returns
For about five months the Czech football has not had a president.There is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting that will take place in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on what election rules to follow.
Without this, voting for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Jindřich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomasz Paczlik are eager to lead Czech football.
Having left, he urged his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
Nevertheless, the Hashek era has once again plunged football into a dispute between the two houses of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became quite obvious on September 16, when a new president had to be elected.
Delegates of the general assembly came in vain to the National House in Prague, Smychov, as negotiations remained blocked, not just by the election procedure.
No agreement was reached on who has the right to vote at the general assembly - only legal representatives or also officials who have been empowered.
This point has since been partially settled thanks to the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation based on conferred powers is impossible.
However, disputes over the election rules continue.
The Executive Board also did not help much, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it is mainly concerned with this issue.
Ideas about how to vote have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: how to move to the 3rd round and avoid the pat?
"The dispute is whether to follow the established norms or find a different model," says one of FAČR vice presidents Dushan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided by the charter, the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate who has received a great deal of support from the house from which he is a candidate.
Moravia has agreed to a compromise to consider the winner of the election the candidate with the highest number of votes in both houses.
The Czech side insists on the condition that in the overall percentage the winner must get at least two-thirds of the votes.
"H, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; this would completely reject the concept of two houses," Freedom agrees with Moravia's arguments.
Somewhat unexpectedly, Tomasz Paclik agrees with his opinion, although according to estimates, the rules of the election, defined by the charter, satisfy Pelt more than other candidates.
“I would like the elections to be held as much as possible according to the statute.”
"I want to avoid all kinds of representative nonsense, as in the previous general assembly," says Victoria's owner Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time; and in his remarks he largely contradicted Pelté.
Pitt remains optimistic.
He believes the new president will be known in Nimburg; he also hopes that candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All the emotional fermentation will be calmed after today's expected national team's departure to the European Championship."
“Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate,” says Jablonec’s representative. Of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rihanna is more restrained.
“I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous.”
"It's not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"This could cause another collapse of the general assembly."
“I hope common sense will win,” Reichl said.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, separate talks were held directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight, which was to deliver, among others, Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucher and Reichl to Podgorica, failed to leave Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction.
After all, the meeting at the ministerial level, which is expected on Wednesday, may be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Joseph Dobes, would like the opponents in the country’s strongest sports association to come to an agreement.
A lot is at stake: government subsidies; the creditworthiness of football; and the planned general meeting of ČSTV with the new Czech Sports Directorate after the financial difficulties of Saška.
Patzlik enters the presidential struggle because he does not see a suitable candidate
If before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of football Plzeň Tomasz Paclik would see a strong candidate that would meet all his requirements for the president of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not even claim to a high post.
"If I were a worthy candidate, I would have fought for him and I would not have participated in the struggle."
"But such a person has not yet been found," said Patzlik to ČTK.
Patzlik's motive for entering the struggle with Miroslav Peltha and Jindřich Reichl was to try to prevent Peltha, the alleged favourite of the elections, from entering the FAČR.
Moreover, Patzlik emphasizes that if he wins, he will remain president only until 2013, when another general assembly is planned.
In the future, he would like this position to be held by an experienced top manager not too connected with football life.
“I talked to a few people I could have thought of.”
"It was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at the moment they don't even want to have anything to do with Czech football."
“I would like to change that opinion,” he said.
Currently, the main disagreement between Pattzlick and Pelta is related to the relationship of the latter with Roman Berbro, president of the regional football association in Plzeň. Berbro is a man of controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist capable of influencing the voices of delegates to the general assembly.
Patzlik thus considers it unacceptable that Pelta should become president.
“If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and the football will not move forward.”
"With the support of Berber, a capable businessman, it would be even more detrimental to football," Paclick said.
He hints at the fact that several years ago, Pelt’s name was recorded during a telephone intercept during a corruption investigation; Pelt managed to escape a sentence.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory would bring to football."
"And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclick.He now does not mention his previous statement that he "will sell the club Plzeň if Pelta becomes president."
If Paclick wins on Thursday, he could have a future collaboration with Pelta.
That view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Paclick supported before the September General Assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
“He (Pelta) would be the first to whom I would turn.”
“He is very capable.”
“I can present him at the head of the team.”
“But he can’t manage the association.”
“I’m not sucking my nose into what I don’t know,” said Patzlik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judge brigade headed by Ludek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Paclick claims that he will risk managing the association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer he has run the Plzeň team, which with his help celebrated in May his first triumph in the league.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better."
"To limit the influence of certain groups of individuals who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal council, which leads to disgusting situations," said Patzlik.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help he will lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money for the sport from the lottery fees.
“This is one of the key issues that the new president should address.”
“If gambling is taxed, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money goes,” he said.
Patzlik does not consider his relationship with the Plzeň club to be a burden, although he argues that the president of the FAČR should be independent.
Pelt is connected with the Jablonec and the Reich with the Prague Dukla.
“This is not the ideal option.”
“And yet I don’t see any sense in hypocritically handing over my shares in Plzeň to someone else, since I’m going to go back there in six months,” says Patzlik.
Pelta promised new FAČR rules that will avoid Electoral Pat
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would fight for the new FAČR rules to avoid future disputes over the rules of election.
Prior to the negotiations in Nimburg on Thursday, the official of Jablonec remains optimistic and believes that the attention from the election struggle will distract the expected success of our football team today.
Prior to the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and receiving funds.
He decided to take part in the election at the last moment before the last general meeting.The two-month delay, therefore, could have been useful for him to defend his ideas about football in a broader context.
“People at all levels have been in football for a long time and they expect the president to be known on Thursday.”
“They feel that it’s time for someone to head the association,” says a man mostly associated with the Jablonec Club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to assume that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hashek.
“Unfortunately, the rules, which were not as perfect as we all thought, were adopted at the general assembly in June.”
"If the different methods of representation were not adopted, we would have had a president since September," Pelta said.
He treated the rewrite of a key civil association document as a false target for delegates.
“If I become president, I will consider it my personal task and I will take personal responsibility if this attempt fails.”
“This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist,” Pelta says.
In addition, he says he is not trying to stand out in the background of rivals.
In the past, he has already stated that he could present his collaboration with Jindřich Reichl, whom he values for his legal education; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice president.
For a long time he did not attack Thomas Paclick, who constantly criticized Pelt.
"He's been in football for more than a year and has achieved some success."
"In any case, his attacks were rude and many people were surprised by the methods of his election campaign."
"Even therefore, some of them now doubt his true identity," Pelta said of his competitor.
He considers his main weapon knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team must represent the whole of football.
“I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemian affair or the consequences of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“I would immediately focus on negotiating with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for the whole football,” the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of football head would not lead to dismissal of staff.
"I will need to know the official instructions of individual employees." This was his message to Strakhov, where the prolonged period of intergovernmental activity causes understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the planned general meeting, he believes delegates will come to Nimburg on Thursday.
"If the only controversial question is how to hold elections in the third round, we can handle that."
"Football needs the confidence it can gain only by finally choosing its leader," says Pelta, who remains optimistic two days before the key day of his career as a functionary.
Reichl promises that under his leadership FAČR will begin to work actively
If Jindřich Reichl, the current vice president, becomes the president of the Czech Football Association at the meeting on Thursday, many people in the Association, according to rumors, will be dissatisfied.
Reichl promises that if he is elected, it will be a time of hard work.
He wants to establish changes in the system and make members of the executive committee responsible for certain areas in football.
He also promises to solve the Bohemian problem; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; attract more money to football; and continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Hashev.
"As president, I would like to focus on football in general."
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to the national team, professional football and youth football events.”
"I don't mean that I will do everything myself," Reichl said in an interview with ČTK.
“I’m a team player and I want to allocate powers in the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area.”
"I will carefully allocate tasks so that in each of these segments, football makes big steps forward."
"This probably won't be liked by many people, as it will mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement presumably made him doubt his candidacy.
“I know about myself that I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know if this makes any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put sticks in my wheels and question my every step," he explained his doubts.
“H, many people have told me I shouldn’t give up, otherwise others will come.”
“It’s a trust that I can’t give up,” he said.
Moreover, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Hashek.
“A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don’t want to overturn it.”
“Processes have been started that can bring results in a few years, and I don’t want anyone else to stop them,” he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Peltha, is elected, the situation in the Association could return to what was before Hashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's something that Mirek Pelta is unlikely to be competent in."
“He’s surrounded by people who would play football so that it’s only available to the selected.”
"I can be blamed in many ways, but not in subjectivity."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to make football accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the elected minority," Reichl said.
Moreover, he denies accusations that he will only be the president of the Czech Republic.
"While many people are trying to argue the opposite, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the division of the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Reichl said.
While the president struggle entered the club manager of Plzeň Tomasz Paclik, Reichl does not dare to evaluate his chances of winning.
“H, I still feel strong support in the Czech House, which has elected me as its vice president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious successes,” Reichl said.
On the other hand, he partially blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Asserting that Pelta was “excluded from the process of returning credit to Czech football,” he considers another rival, Paclik, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzeň this year."
"If he is elected, I hope that he will continue what Ivan Hasek started, without significant personnel changes in the committees."
“He’t distort facts for his own benefit,” Reichl said of his opponent.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
jump into the water.
Julia Stank
Children’s pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travellers can experience the incredible water of Europe on their own – and relax a tired body in a jacuzzi after a city tour or walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
One thing Iris Meader could not do without during her research trips for the last year and a half: without her swimsuit.
Lieing on her back in the water, she looked up at the tastefully decorated domes, sailed to the marble cherubim waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored swimming pools in the style of ar-nuvo.
She rushed to add every swimming pool she liked to her notebook – with important details about the building’s construction and history.
Architectural historian Meeder has explored more than 200 swimming pools – and has now gathered impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden, which includes everything from public pools in Munich to historic swimming palaces in the Black Forest and “functional concrete buildings” in Townshend.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited swimming pools in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland – and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for the sport, Meeder says, but in the water it’s different.
The only disadvantage is that swimming fans have to tolerate the blue canvas and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the seductive smell of needle forests or listen to the cheering of birds in the park.
“I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so awful,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
“So I started collecting beautiful swimming pools.”
When the surface doubles the architecture
Swimming in the pool and refined oils in the sauna - the health factor in the bathrooms is so significant, because, according to Meeder, all the senses are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eye, if builders take on such work. "Instead of the floor in the pool you have a surface of water."
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tiles and tramps.
The 190-page illustrated edition of "The Joy of Swimming" contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oases - and causes you to want to jump into the water.
Meeder, a reservoir collector, discovered several outstanding specimens during a study in Hungary.
She discovered nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (Cave Bath in Mischolz-Tapolz) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jasper), as well as magnificent therapeutic baths, such as the 100-year-old Sechen Baths in Budapest.
Of the many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is a stunning view. You can see all of Zurich from the bathroom on the roof or look at the snowed Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anton. And in the steamroom there is a window that allows you to see what is happening on the ski.
Per the most unusual design awaits swimmers in Langenfeld. The Aqua Cathedral in Etzal looks like an UFO just landed in the Alps.
In the winter, the steam of three open shells rises from it, which appear to be quite small against the background of the Ettal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
The pool collector Meeder did not meet the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell gray.Arpad baths in Bekeshchab smell so oil that it can be difficult for you to believe that you are in a health source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbons in alkaline water. The water is almost black from the mud that sticks to the skin as soon as you dive into the pool is a health experience of a certain type.
Iris Meeder, however, at some point was disappointed in her search for beautiful places to swim.When she tried to visit the open swimming pool of the Czech Baths in Lugacovice, she found that the territory was sealed.
The bathrooms, designed by the architect Dushan Yurkovich in 1902, were closed.
When Meeder looked into the viewing windows of the red-white-yellow building in the style of ar-nuvo, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped by hot tracks is the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald – the Palace of Thermal Waters in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already gone through three stages of construction. You will discover not only neo-Roman elements of the post-building period in 1844, but also the Alhambra-style Moorish hall, added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace – the favorite swimming pool of swimming pool scholar Iris Meeder – and not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
“It’s a real achievement – so skillfully combining such different architectural styles,” says Meeder.
Dive into a thermal pool in such a palace is clearly a secondary occupation.
Speculation on agricultural products
Deutsche Bank is investigating trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tivs
Will Deutsche Bank stop selling agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann gave the task to the working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the poor around the world.
The executive plan to make changes in January.
Hamburg –
According to one study, 84 percent of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products as trade aggravates the problems facing the world’s poorest people.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The report’s author, Harald Schuman, demonstrates that gambling on global commodity exchanges raises prices – and banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The campaign of consumer advocates is directed against Deutsche Bank chief Joseph Ackermann, although major banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade the same.
Initially, rates on goods were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand – and make a living at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann responded to criticism.He promised to investigate the allegations and stated that no trade "is worth risking the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation is expected to be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank – with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes that follow the investigation in late January.
Trade in goods may decrease or stop at all.
Akkerman works on his image.
Foodwatch President Tilo Bode welcomed the news, stressing his critical attitude toward the financial sector: “States on rising food prices are a shocking example of how mindlessly banks are now acting against the common interests.”
As the chief lobbyist of the bank, Akkermann has a certain duty, according to Bode.
“The Deutsche Bank should remove from its portfolio all investments that make cash bets on food prices,” said Bode.
“It doesn’t matter whether it’s about starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s quick reaction at first surprised, but in the meantime the director would like to have an impeccable image just a few months before he ends his stay in the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not move into the supervisory board as planned.
The abolition of controversial speculation on the food market could improve its image.
He also virtually does not need to worry about expenses - the consequences will have to deal with his successor.
Every second would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization’s campaign.
The study was conducted for the Forsa Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
Not more than eleven percent believe that investments that bet on food prices are acceptable for Deutsche Bank.
Many bank clients would also take specific steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade.According to research, every second would withdraw deposits, which ultimately lead to commodity speculation.
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they would consider closing their account and moving to another bank.
21st Century House in Vienna
Pavilion in a New Place
Ingeborg Vinsovsky
The Pavilion of Austria for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and abandoned.
It is now reopened as an exhibition center.
The Pavilion of Austria, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a famous example of modern post-war architecture with its simple shapes, glass halls that boldly expressed faith in technical progress.
Schwanzer's Pavilion won the Grand Prix of Architecture in 1958 for its lightweight steel and glass floating structure.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Pavilion of Austria at the next World Exhibition.
Eventually, it became world famous in 1973 with its legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and its sister – a cup-shaped building.
Designed as a temporary exhibition building, the pavilion was moved to the Swiss Garden near the Southern Station of Vienna, converted and opened as the 20th century museum in 1962 - and is often referred to as the "House of the 20th century" for this reason.
In any case, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it did not have walls to hang works of art on, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna got a new home.
The house was empty since 2001 and its condition was getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has so far restored the pavilion, which has been named the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum is a branch of the Belvedere Museum, which will open its first exhibition on Tuesday evening – in every sense a joyful event.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, contributed to the new initiative.
Husslaine-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a figurative in her youth, who worked at Sotheby’s, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, persuaded politicians and custodians to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and decided on how the building would be used.
The new museum was to accommodate a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Votruba Foundation, a café and a bookstore along with contemporary art.
Strict control and limited budget
Krishanitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Viennese Secession of Joseph Olbrich, and won the contest, but he also studied with Schwanzer at the Viennese University of Technology, and the pavilion was for him "an extremely important place" where he attended exhibitions "almost every week".
He knew the original design and knew the challenges facing the building, a building that had already lost some of its majesty and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that arose during the last reconstruction were much more serious.The building was a “energy absorber,” says Krishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, glass-fiber-enhanced safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with high-strength safety glass.
The steel pavements of the heat bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors created space for the new use of the building, a burning light well between the building and the street provides lighting – a virtually new building, but still an elegant Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors were preserved, and the building was painted in the old red-brown color of corrosion protection.
The cinema hall is the same as it was before.
All this under strict control of the museum management and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap, and would be approved by the museum management," Krishanitz says, pointing to the uneven flooring in the basement.
The building remains flexible and lightweight despite limitations, problems and transformations.
Krishanitz recently noted that the pavilion “from Brussels” was rough – a typical story of “a drop in the city.”
Such an architecture “is not always in place” and yet wants to “stimulate real awareness.”
The 21st-century house is in the right place, as an unexpected luck happened when planning the city. The completely redesigned "Master Station Quarter" with offices and residential properties grows around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event may occur.The 21st century home may be complemented by the second building of Krishanitz - collector Francesca von Habsburg has acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and isly negotiating with the city about its location nearby in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multi-million winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of trains in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
The costs will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to the internal anti-crisis plan of Deutsche Bahn, the newspaper Bild reports that investments in the total amount of about 300 million euros are planned until 2015.
The investment is intended to improve the performance of locomotives and the railway network even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and engaged employees involved in snow cleaning from roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clean the platforms of snow and ice before the start of work and 90 percent of the necessary shooters within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancellations and delays of trains this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger transportation, as it lacked reserves at the time of deteriorating weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Service for years.
There were also some delays with the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn has also for years had to check the axes of ICE trains more frequently after one of the ICE trains broke the axes at the main train station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank to pay millions of pounds in U.S.
New troubles followed the unrest surrounding Joseph Ackermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is threatened with a fine in the United States of many million pounds.
As if Deutsche Bank had little trouble at home, the past of the industrial giant in the U.S. has now overtaken it. Deutsche Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (106 million euros) to settle disputes arising after the bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem arose around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to deceive credit unions to buy their financial products.
The value of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and dragged down the credit unions.
“We are pleased to have resolved this problem without bringing the parties to court,” said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not acknowledge its guilt.
The same is true for Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Mattz welcomed the prompt response of both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
NCUA is fighting to compensate for the losses that come out of billions.
This is the first agreement of this kind.
The regulator also turned attention to other major banks and filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Dubious mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a pool of mortgage loans.
They are supported by domestic loans.
This decided the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble broke in the U.S. real estate market in 2007.
US investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 on the brink of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still struggling with the storm.
Investors and regulators have filed a large number of claims demanding compensation or punishment for fraudsters.
Behind the biggest wave of claims is the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).
It accuses 18 major international banks of purchasing $200 billion in collateral agreements from U.S. credit institutions Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche Bank also faces the threat of prosecution by the FHFA over numerous agreements worth a total of $14.2 billion concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator demands that the bank with its headquarters in Frankfurt assume responsibility for "significant losses", but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and said it intended to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests $10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares for a total of more than $10 billion.
So far, U.S. largest investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he is not investing in computer and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM’s annual report changed his view of investing in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have understood much earlier that IBM is primarily offering services and purchasing computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett’s investments were regarded as a knightly act.
IBM, a veteran of the IT industry, has now received the title of "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the American business television channel CNBC, Buffett said that since March he has acquired shares of IBM for a total amount of $10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest holders of IBM shares with a stake of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM did not know anything about his involvement until recently.
He praised the management, which managed to profits even during the financial crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said, referring to the management strategy.
For a considerable time, IBM has been focused on high-profit IT services such as data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, which is now more than 100 years old, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided technology companies.
He claimed that he only invested in those companies whose business he understood.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of lubricants and in engineering.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns shares in a long list of largest companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Municher Rück), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and with the help of skillful investments built on its basis one of the most expensive companies in the world.
His way of life, however, remained modest.
making it a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible instinct to make money brought him the nickname of the “Oracle of Omaha.”
The price of IBM shares rose by one percent before the markets opened after Buffett’s announcement of investments.
The "Blue Giant", as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
But Buffett has said he is not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
The imminent danger
After the identification of the "cell in Zwickau" Turkish media began to doubt the power of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now again rising to the surface.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were a reaction to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community in Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has brought to life long-forgotten fears.Such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks have not occurred since the incendies in Melne in November 1992 and in Zollingen in May 1993.
Never doubted, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network now discovered has such a scale that it is not yet fully aware.
“The Revival of Bloody Ideology?” was the headline of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the perpetrators was a secret intelligence agent, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be drawn into a right-wing extremist mud.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly by commemorating the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket in front of the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin at a ceremony with the participation of German and Turkish politicians celebrated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral employment agreement.
The cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light – as a success story.
"A Gift from Germany for the Fifty Anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German publication Hürriyet also did not miss the opportunity to make this parallel.
"It begins to smell bad" is the name of the column of Ahmed Kulahji.
He notes that people who paid taxes and contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany were killed.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful crackdown were heavily criticized on German-Turkish internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities hadn’t thought about monitoring suspicious persons in right-wing extremists earlier.
Some authors have come to a rather sharp rhetoric: “If they continue to act as uncomfortable, migrants will have no choice but armed self-defense.”
“It’s the best self-defense.”
"The world in Germany depends heavily on how the entire network will be unlocked and on the legitimacy of the punishment," Selen writes.
The crimes in Melne and Zollingen in the 1990s were an example of the world peace in Germany being threatened.
The photo of the burned ruins in Zollingen was deeply imprinted in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
No other event has shown so clearly to the Turks who live here that they are in danger, and to the Germans that distrust and indifference can turn into real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the Turkish sense of unity.
Not repeating the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press in that period largely condemned the failures of German police after the attacks. Helmut Kohl refused to visit survivors in Melne.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the fires in Zolingen, but his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel took part in the memorial ceremony in Cologne - Kinkel in his speech calculated the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany.
It is as if he determined the value of a person by the taxes he pays.
The current coverage in Turkish media has once again shown how deepened has since been the distrust of many German Turks towards the current German state.
Clearly showing what needs to be done now in addition to efforts to identify and reassess right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal at Lake Zurich
Most of the leading risky banks in Europe are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS barely went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has since continuously struggled with one and another crisis.
Now the German must return it to the right course.
Alex Weber probably did not suspect that he would get this role.
In July, after his spectacular departure from the post of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would begin to work on the equally spectacular post of Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and lucrative career.
Alex Weber was clearly delighted, praising Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for the newly found strength, and made a few friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
“UBS has changed for the better.”
“I look forward to working with Kaspar Filiger and Oswald Grubel.”
But in September, it became clear that everything would be different.
London-based trader UBS surpassed the bank’s security systems and lost about €1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grubel, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the UBS Board of Directors has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, the chairman of the council he will take the post in May, not in 2013.
It’s not going to be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist in the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He suddenly turned out to be responsible for the strategy of the bank, which once again proved that it has long earned the title of "the biggest banking scandal in Europe".
UBS, on the one hand, is very large – until recently it has managed the largest assets in the world – and, on the other hand, has not come out of scandals for years.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank does not save anything.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a good reputation.
The bank combined the image of a covert and stable but at the same time agile asset manager with ambitious goals and the aspiration to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed $1.6 billion, thus having more money in the management of wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
As an investment bank, it has entered the league of the largest banks in the world.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking who has long taught at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich, explains: “I have always referred to my students UBS as a model of a good bank.”
"Knowing what we know now, you might ask how I could have been so wrong."
He really was very wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was going wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, executive director Peter Wuffley – who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker – left his post unexpectedly.
A few months later, we could guess why he left.
The investment unit of the bank tried to play on substandard securities and was forced to write down billions.
Believe it or not, but UBS has announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to cope with the crisis.
The bank has really managed to find investors — but investors that many bankers would have courteously refused until recently — one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund so hidden that even its name has not been disclosed.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, and Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel – the second highest-paid Chairman of the Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006 – resigned.
Due to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS faced the threat of collapse, and the state had to save it.
The National Bank purchased toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with compulsory conversion to become co-owner of the bank.
The whole Switzerland was in shock: the country realized the dramatic consequences of having huge banks set up in a small country.
After all, UBS’ total balance sheet in 2007 was five times greater than all Swiss output (see chart).
“We won’t be able to save UBS a second time,” says banking analyst Geiger.
The second accident occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS surrendered in a tax dispute with the U.S. and said it was ready to transfer data from wealthy customers who may have been tax evaders with the help of the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of reimbursement of unjustified business revenues plus fines.
UBS thus more or less acknowledged that it was an instrument of tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in the struggle for wealthy customers – the veil of secrecy.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The money of the customers began.
Over the course of several months, the bank has lost confidence in both main areas of its activity – investing due to unsuccessful speculation and managing assets as a result of aid and incentives for tax evasion.
And then everything calmed down and it seemed like UBS was able to reverse the situation, as this disaster happened with the trader. One trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
One thing is clear – risk management in the investment department is not yet working.
“The Adoboli incident clearly showed that risk control has not changed enough,” says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of one of Germany’s largest banks said: “The problem with UBS is that it doesn’t have a tool to control risks.”
It was caution that for a long time made Swiss bankers the keepers of the world’s largest assets – not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine republic or not.
Swiss bank coffers have become a symbol of unwavering reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the refined taste in chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich still corresponds to the image of a decent Swiss private bank, but it’s a little bigger.
Its location is a classic in itself.
The headquarters of the bank is located in Zurich on the Banhofstraße, which leads from the main train station directly to the Lake Zurich, surrounded by the snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss stores such as Confiserie Sprüngli, you can find jewelry firms such as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been located here for hundreds of years – from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse and elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
A heavy door leads to the UBS hall.
Along the marble-covered walls are large leather sofas. Next to the bank emblem is a large "Safe" indicator.
UBS knows what its customers need – reliability.
But the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned the Swiss concepts of banking — or, as the head of one of the smaller Swiss banks believes, betrayed them.
He’t want to see his name in the newspaper – like all Swiss bankers, he’s also working with the two largest banks.
He believes UBS has become too big – in particular, in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons are very active.
The Swiss have nothing to add.
"And if there is something, it means that they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, bringing it its first big profits – and then a fiasco. No other financial institution in Europe has lost as much money in the jungles of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the country's history," writes Lucas Hasig in his book The UBS Crash.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened before?
If you ask Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly the size of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed that was already too big for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
This was also helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other. One was a wealthy but ranked bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so wealthy, but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin the all-powerful wheel.
Two names are associated with UBS growth: Peter Wolfley, CEO of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I’ve always believed that Woolfley and Opel are a dream team,” says banking analyst Hans Geiger.
“Wulffley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understanding of models and statistics, and Ospell with his inner instinct, has gone all the way up, starting with an internship in the bank.”
But in the end, Oscars settled on Woolfley.
And Woolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He decided that his models were a reality," says Geiger.
“It is tragic.”
Maybe it is tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS officials remember the meetings of board members, where Woolfley repeated the same slogan – to move Goldman Sachs.
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he headed the "tournament table", where the successes of banks were made.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make part of that path.
UBS was the largest player in currency and government securities trading.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak spot. By the parameter, which in banking terminology is called "stable income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS has failed in American mortgage products.
To close the hole, UBS embarked on an adventure that barely cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and the hedge fund it founded invested in U.S. sub-standard securities.
This developed into a large mechanism that combined securities based on American mortgages and sold them further – continuing to bear the risks itself.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
“UBS purchased until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already on fire,” says Banking analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager had to leave after another as attempts to get the bank in order turned out to be more difficult than it seemed at first.
Posts at UBS have become a child’s game with chairs and remain unreliable to this day.
Anyone who leads this huge bank faces an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Banking analyst Geiger already has an idea – to abandon investment banking, focus on asset management and forget about his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not yet ready to go so far.
Nevertheless, it is clear that investment activities need to be significantly narrowed.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually only considered a temporary solution when the bank unexpectedly broke up with his predecessor Grubel.
Over the past time, he has been able to show character and now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, he is head of UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to bring the investment bank back to the state it was in in the mid-1990s.
It will cut 3,500 jobs.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a development concept.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions must be asked by Axel Weber.
Publicly he has so far only said that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
The next year.
Fears of recession in Europe drag the US stock market down
The ongoing recession in Europe has worsened the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome did not have much effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has stifled hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the embryo.

Legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to confirm these fears.In an interview with CNBC he said it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything it takes to end the crisis.
Therefore, in his opinion, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.

Smart crows fill the cities.
The grachis are considered problematic birds in many places. Experts today say that these very intelligent birds will no longer be able to be expelled from the cities.
Some love birds, others would like to get rid of them as quickly as possible. crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but inhabitants complaining of dirt and noise in many settlements are becoming more and more.
The problem of birds, however, has not yet been resolved.
At the first symposium dedicated to crows in the city of Ler in Eastern Frisia, experts argued that crows could no longer be expelled from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Conservatives argued that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of specially protected cattle, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction and cutting of traditional for nesting trees complicated the life of birds.
The crows are under guard.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwest in Yaver, Dipholz, Achima near Bremen and Lera there are large colonies of more than 600 parent couples.
The ambiguous project of firing crows in Lera caused disapproving newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described catching birds in traps and striking them with sticks as a special cruelty.
“Ordinary displacement and frightening don’t do anything,” said architect and landscape designer Werner Klever of Lear.
Breaking nests with a stream of water or cutting trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental protection expert Manfred Kaiser from Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals are scattered, and large colonies are divided and spread to other areas.”
Deterrence is possible only in the form of exceptions near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
“We’ll have to live with them, getting rid of them is not an option.”
Separated from the surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
A combination of frightening birds from residential areas in need of protection and prompting them to return to other areas could be a way out.
"Information stands instead of seals" was a slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Utah Maria Jürgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds.
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational crawl route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information boards provide information about the lives of very sensible crawlers.
The project already attracts the interest of tourists.
Jürgens also expressed her opinion about the complaints about the noise produced by birds. “Noise conveys a lot of information.
The mind and wisdom of these birds have entered the legends.Grachi often not only use weapons to seize the stumped piece, but also make the weapons themselves.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested a measure of bird’s mind on four grades.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that it was necessary to tap the board to get the larvae of the mole.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to break down the plate.
In another experiment, smart players had to solve a more difficult task.
The researchers placed a small cane with a molar larvae in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not get the prey with a clove.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used the wire to make the hooks and used the hooks to cling the cane to the pen and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players managed this from the first attempt.
Ronaldo leads Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for victory in the last minute did not last long.
The favourites of Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took the final seats in the Euro 2012 championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the leadership of the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored in 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina with a score of 6:2 (2:1), perfectly forming its fifth Euro entry after 0:0 in the first stage.
The Czechs were sufficient 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of play-offs against Montenegro's outsider after a net victory in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss their chance, playing 0-0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily achieved a score of 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (minutes 24), Neldr Postiga (minutes 72 and 82) and Miguel Veloz (minutes 80) scored the remaining goals for Portugal.
Former professional player of the Bundesliga from Wolfsburg Zvezdan Misimovich and captain Emir Spahić reduced the difference of two points thanks to a resultant penalty at the 41st minute and a goal at the 65th for Bosnia.
Senna Lulić received the second yellow card at the 54th minute.
Portugal has already defeated Bosnia from the playoffs of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Portugal made a great start at Lisbon’s Estadio da Luz.
Ronaldo took the early start, making a free blow to the goal from about 30 meters.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-range abilities, increasing the score to 2:0 from the 25-meter mark.
The Bosnians, who did not open the account in the first half-hour, got their first chance thanks to the attacker Edin Jeko.
The former player of Wolfsburg from the leader of the English championship Manchester City in the 33rd minute sent the ball with his head to the lower edge of the bar, but the ball did not cross the line of goal.
Yiraček scores for the Czech Republic
Then in the center of attention was judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
Following the attack on Elder Posthigo in the Bosnian penalty squad in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was simulating, and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a questionable penalty for playing the hand after the fool to Fabiu Kuantan - Misimovich implemented it.
After the break, the vice-champions of Europe in 2004 fixed the account with four more goals.
Petr Yiraček dissipated all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European Championships go to the European Championships for the fifth consecutive time.
Luck also smiled to coach Michael Bilec and Bundesliga legionaries Michael Cadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FC Nuremberg) after a mistake at the very beginning that could have become catastrophic.
The goalkeeper Peter Chech in the 9th minute thanks to an instantaneous reflex prevented the potential autogol of Tomas Sivok.
The best chances for Montenegro were when the duo of Stevan Yovetich and Dejan Damianovich was on the field.
Damyanovich in the 40th minute struck from the edge of the penalty pitch and barely scored a goal for Chechnya.
After a break, the staff saved the already crushed world-class goalkeeper Czech after the forerunner of FC Seoul left the field in the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whisper.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks were unable to play better than the 0-0 draw in Zagreb.
Although there is now almost no doubt that the coach of the national team Gus Hiddink will now free a seat on the bench of the team, which reached the third place in 2002, the Croats for the fourth time find themselves in the final round of the European Championship.
The Turks almost managed to start perfectly in front of the eyes of 31 000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium.
The long-range blow of Seljuk Inan at the seventh minute hit the stand, and the attacker Kazim Kazim failed to repel the ball in the net.
Croatia then woke up and increasingly took control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent shape.
Bundesliga Legionaries Daniel Pranich (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Ayntracht, Frankfurt) were on the pitch along with Mario Mandzhukich from the Volfsburg team, who ceded the place to Ivan Perishich from Dortmund in the 62nd minute.
Trapatoni is going to Euro 2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first entry to the Euro since Germany in 1988.

Konstantin Vasilyev of the team of the guests matched in the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good pace from the start, but only in the 23rd minute Robbie Keane from Los Angeles made the first net goal.
At the last moment, the Estonian defense managed to prevent him from pulling Ireland forward.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
Bypassing the defense of goalkeeper Paul London, Ward was in the right place and, letting the ball across the line, changed the score to 1:0.

SAP plans to double employment in China

Mass murder – the human dimension
Peter Englund’s tense and very good new book, Beauty and Sorrow: A Personal History of the First World War, begins with a long list of actors from whom the heart dies.
Here’s a tip on how to read further: carefully cut out this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund tells the story, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon in those moments when, like one of these men and women, you fall off the road and get lost in the mist of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he has written now is unusual, he describes it, quite accurately, as “an anti-historical work.”
There are few known names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, ingenious journalists, or discussions of tactics and combat equipment.
It’s not so much a book about what was, he explains, as a “book about what it looked like.”
"Beauty and Grief" brings together the experience of 20 more or less remarkable men and women from both sides of the front line, from schoolchildren and botanicals to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and staff.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone will get captured, lose a hand or leg, get mad or die.
Their lives flash here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some are extinguished at this time.
Mr. Englund’s Book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is also an amendment to the notion that the First World War was only a heavy barricade war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully gives a panorama of other theaters of military action: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall beekeepers; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unresolved problem is the cece fly.
It’s an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
War covers the lives of these people, like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of smoke-free dust.
When a canonade is heard nearby, and you are a woman and you are at home with your children, will you stay there or run away?
Anyway, who is it?
Almost no one understands what is happening and why it is necessary to fight in this war.
“The lack of facts,” notes Mr. Englund, “is filled with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
Beauty and Sorrow follows the fate of people like Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young seamen of the German Open Sea Fleet.
Their stories are taken mainly from memoirs, letters and other materials already published.
The stories of their lives can be frightening or thrilling, but they are mostly alive thanks to the tiny moments and fragile details collected by Mr. Englund.
Many of them are about deprivations and how to deal with them.
Speaking of the story of a German schoolgirl, he says: "Erzaz, everywhere erzaz."
“Replacement alcohol, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons.”
He continues to talk about erzac food in Germany.
He describes “meat of pressed rice cooked in lamb fat (and decorated with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skin; shoes cut by a tree.”
He notes that there were "837 registered meat substitutes authorized in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories tell about honor and courage.
One American notices in himself the desire for cruelty and says of war: "You feel that, after all, it's what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, a evening newspaper or a bestseller and claim that this showcase is civilization and under your sculpted shirt with hips does not hide a barbar."
The British soldier, on the contrary, notices that he is most likely to die and nobody will notice it or be upset.
"When a person accepts the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that it will happen in front of the public," he writes.
But this is the opposite, terribly similar to “a convicted man who is hanged secretly.”
Other remarks concern the old Europe that is collapsing, and the new forms of fear.
“The conflict became increasingly an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war of factories.”
He notes the arrival of what he calls “a new look in the bestselling of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressive and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-sewed suit, who arranges a massacre sitting at a desk.”
People act in an unpredictable way: low acts are as many as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke of the soldiers who in every way tried to get away from the prostitutes with a sexually transmitted disease in order to avoid service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonorrhea pus, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital," he writes.
Desperate people rub him in the eyes, often leading to lifelong blindness.
The prose of Mr. Englund, translated from Swedish by Peter Graves, is flexible, but nonchalant, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war “liberated completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People start asking why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I were often indirect, such as Paul Fassell's "The Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich-Marie Remarque's "On the Western Front Without Changes", rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund’s Book is part of this non-shaped pantheon.
His book has the most stunning ending I can remember in non-artistic literature.
I will not tell him.
But it's like he pulled from a book to a page with a list of characters, picked it out of your hands and lit it with a light bulb.
After the previous mistake - carefully calculated ride
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some wearing helmets.
The nighttime from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because there should have been the least people in Zuckotti Park at that time.
The operation was kept secret from everyone except a few senior officers, the rest were first told that they were going to exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the events, and his presence highlighted the importance the Police Department had given to the operations.
There could be no mention of the repetition of such episodes of recent weeks as the use of pear gas against protesters, which contradicted the department’s rules and sparked a hurricane of public sympathy for the occupants.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation to liberate Zukotti Park from the protesters began.
The authorities were preparing to observe how occupations were unfolding in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were conducted on the island of Randalls with the calculation of Zuckotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riots training – counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid displacement of a large number of police officers – referring to Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came "in the last minute," a source familiar with the orders, in which the task was mentioned only as "training."
"Those few cops I know who have been summoned for this case have not been told that they are being sent to Zukotti Park," said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zuckotti Park were at the top positions in the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, the authorities wanted to clean the park, but retreated to the hundreds of protesters who sneaked inside before the deadline, after hearing about these plans.
Officers from various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including district forces – police teams that were typically used to control the criminal surroundings of the area.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like at work, come and leave the park during the day, making 1 hour at night the right time to attack.
“It was right to do this when there was the least people in the park,” he said.
Rescue cars with projectors and speakers gathered at the Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
Reflectors and pre-recorded ads from speakers seem to have scared many protesters.
When officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue windshields, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
Police said the tents were not touched until 1:45 p.m., giving protesters time to gather their things.
Other groups of police officers, according to eyewitnesses, gathered along the perimeter to enter the park in case arrests are needed.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a spokesman for the head of the police department, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police acted and that the police treated them brutally.
Mr. Brown said that cars with television cameras on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could have taken a picture.
When the police went west through a bunch of protesters’ personal belongings, including bags, plastic carpets and plastic bags full of clothes, teams from the Department of Health followed her, collecting what had been thrown away.
Some of the protesters who refused to leave were pulled out, photos of it soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the camp’s kitchen, in the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police entered, methodically arresting them.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp clutched themselves together by the arms.
And two men attached themselves to the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
In order to cut the castles, rescue workers were called.
No arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 in the morning, Mr. Kelly said.
The operation was completed in about 75 minutes, police said.
Mr. Brown said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “violation of public order and resistance during detention,” he said.
The highest-ranking officer was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department’s search police, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, although present, “did not lead the operation,” Mr. Brown said.
A second group of police were waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Siddar Street, in case they had to enter.
Barriers were placed on Courtland Street, in the quarter north of the park, and on Pine Street, in the quarter south.
Observers saw the police extend the perimeter even further beyond the boundaries of Zukotti Park from these positions.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, pushing people even further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, were blowing out the air from the tyres of a police van.
At some point, a piece of fanery flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one policeman and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The school staff union will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
A trade union representing hundreds of school service employees who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students study.
The trial is probably the last remedy available to the Trade Union of District Council 37, which is trying to cancel dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city lost their seats on October 7 as a result of what trade union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds managed by workers’ groups to close the budget gap last spring.
City officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At hearings in the City Council last month, school chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the redundancies were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the board members pared, telling him there was no indication anywhere in the budget that school support staff would be fired.
Representatives of the 37 district council that they had addressed the complaint notice, warning the Department of Education that a lawsuit was filed against him; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the formal filing of the lawsuit to the State Supreme Court of Manhattan.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the City’s Department of Education as defendants and list eight temporary workers as defendants, all of them black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and could therefore not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint at the disposal of the New York Times, the trade union has focused on a number of dismissals in schools in poor districts of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, arguing that poor schools have lost more assistants because they are chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no dismissals on Staten Island, and there were few in Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 supporting school workers lost seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in District 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants working at the free 36 high school in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, “These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to fill budget gaps.”
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it counts additional funding for every poor student that enters school.
The union also argues that school directors may have been misled by the language of a notification authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The notification used the word "excess", although "excess" is more often said when a teacher from the school's payment record moves to the list of existing employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
“Sixy-six coordinators for working with parents were dismissed,” the draft of the lawsuit says, “and not simply translated.”
Congress ready for agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on the Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the uprising to succeed, long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and American intervention to end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is due to consider a resolution put forward by Chairman John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), which praises the Libyans for the successful uprising and the American troops for their “courage.”
"The meaning of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"This is a confirmation of support for their democratic aspirations on both sides."
The language may seem harmless, but no discussion about Libya has been easy yet.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties have argued with each other and the White House about the formulations of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the U.S. military in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution allowing a limited use of U.S. forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a significant majority of votes of both parties and has never been voted in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also rejected a proposal that would cut funding for the U.S. operation in Libya.
This has left the US mission in some sort of legislative cleansing ground – when Congress is irritated enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not angry enough to really kick the ground out of its feet.
Events then surpassed Congress' indecisiveness
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
NATO’s mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee’s resolution “admired the people of Libya for their incredible courage and extraordinary resilience in their quest for freedom” and thanked the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.
The resolution also “affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measures get the full support of the Foreign Affairs Council or split the lawmakers, like the June bill?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicans in the Committee.
A spokesman for Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives is due to vote this week for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a major legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by House member Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or anything else to be put to the plenary vote of the Congress of this convocation.
Other lawmakers have not yet been able to make their amendments to the plenary session, but not because they have not tried.
The Goodlat amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments covering a wide range of issues that were put forward in this convention.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, - others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of amendments on a balanced budget only in the House of Representatives and a few more on “control over federal spending.”
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors—mostly newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their resumes—the opportunity to boast that they have “proposed” such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote for the amendment on a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office of members of Congress, and House member Jose Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to remove the limitation of two terms for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) proposed many amendments to guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and healthcare.
An amendment that prohibits same-sex marriages has been proposed for many years, as well as another that prohibits the burning of a flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two-thirds of the states object to them.
No matter how much Congressmen have tried to propose amendments, they are not moving forward faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th made 66.
This rate is shrinking compared to the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Library of the Senate, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they did not succeed more than they do now.
The last amendment that was adopted, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but it was actually submitted to Congress in 1789.
"Beaten but not defeated," Giffords says in her first television interview after the assassination.
Ten months after an armed man shot her at a public event in Tucson, Representative House member Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on the federal channel on Monday evening, sang a song from the Broadway show “The Sun Returns Tomorrow” and said she wanted more to recover than to return to Congress.
Having appeared on the show "20/20" by ABC News with Dianna Sawyer, Giffords had trouble formulating suggestions and needed help when walking.
The program showed her difficult recovery path after a bullet injury that crushed the skull and broke through the left side of the brain, going from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and triumphantly voted on the debt limit bill.
In her first television interview after a January shooting that killed six and wounded 13 people, Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang — and called her recovery “difficult.”
When Sawyer was asked how she felt, Giffords, 41, replied, “It’s very good.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hourly special edition "20/20", which was shown on the eve of the release of the new couple's book "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope".
The special issue told about the restoration of Giffords after the January 8 shooting.
In the video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she lies on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scarring on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at her husband’s request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair and physiotherapists teaching her how to perform simple actions.
Shake the head.
Stretch the lips.
And then her first word: “What?”
A few days later, Giffords uttered the second word, "toast", a request to change the breakfast menu.
A video shown by ABC shows that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: we see a congressman singing alongside doctors "The Girls Just Want to Have Fun" by Cindy Lopez and "Free Fall" by Tom Petty.
In an interview, Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she did not remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he was reading a Giffords article in a newspaper about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him to first ask about the six who were killed then.
Suspect assailant Jerd Lee Laffner is detained in a Missouri prison and undergoes forced treatment in anticipation of trial.
“A lot of people have died,” Giffords Sawyer said.
“It is hard, hard, hard.”
One day during her recovery, said Kelly Sawyer, she said, “I’m defeated.”
“And I said, ‘Gabby, you’re not defeated,’” Kelly said.
You are just beaten.
And you’ll go through it, you’ll recover and come back stronger than ever.
They feel more compassion than respect.
The event was a celebration on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for the homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
According to the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and naval infantry set up around him.
The smoking audience applauded him standing.
“The soldiers were viewed as heroes,” said David Salzman, who organized the spring fundraising.
The senior military officer at the concert, which also attended the then chairman of the Chief of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
“They were treated like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I think the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn’t respect, it was pity.
Completely opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have been established between the military and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American public.
The soldiers were praised for their victims.
But praise has its price, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly behaving like they feel pity for people in shape.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is soon leaving for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unhappy.”
This is a sensitive topic for military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger faced by returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War has been much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity happen quietly and only between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from marine combat, retired Colonel Mark Kenshne warned them that people outside the army would look at their service from two perspectives.
Some will look at them with admiration, because they stumbled upon rebels and visited exotic places.
Others will be wondering if “a cruel, evil veteran is hidden under the mask,” said Kenshne, who fought in Iraq and returned to occupy a senior government post in Washington.
While he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking if he could withstand the tension of responsible work in Washington immediately after the campaign.
Kenshne recalls how he told his sons, “When you talk about your ministry, you should expect a negative effect.”
The inconvenience experienced by the military is partly due to American indifference to wars.
Victories on the battlefield are rarely praised by a country that is little familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism as it was usual in World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barrow, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public mainly focuses on the depth of the military’s suffering.
The troops are judged by the number of campaigns they have made, by the number of comrades they have lost, or by the scale of losses.
The army faces growing pressure from supporters of the fight against rape
This week, a historic court hearing is due to decide whether 28 men and women will be sued against the army on charges of non-opposition to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will be in line with the next.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman is 25 years old and at the 11th week of pregnancy, she allegedly was raped by her co-worker at night.
It was in October 2008, she was returning to her camp at Miramar Airport, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend and met a fellow servant carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could come to her room for a drink.
“It was a red flag,” Lyman says.
But the Texas native rejected her concerns.
I thought, no, he’s 19 years old.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
“Sad that I didn’t listen to my instinct.”
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, a man approached her from behind, struck her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will be waiting for the court’s decision at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia to decide whether to bring the lawsuit they filed against former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld to court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to cope with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by lawyer Susan Burke from Washington, D.C., originally included 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 over the following months – 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they have been raped or threatened with sexual assault by fellow servants and that the military has not properly investigated, prosecuted or secured proper justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she has targeted the top ranks of the army because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are those people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Burke also says about 400 other victims have contacted her since February, many of whom may be involved in future lawsuits.
Her strategy: Instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in the case — putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak — she would open up a lot of things if needed to maintain pressure.
The Defense Department’s defense team, led by Federal Prosecutor Neil McBride, has taken steps to end the case.
The court documents received by Newsweek reveal a defence strategy — mostly consisting of former or current soldiers not being able to make claims to the army for damage incurred in the armed forces.
According to the doctrine named in the 1950 Supreme Court Decision of the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for damages caused by persons on military service.
"The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the applicants," the documents say.
The Defense Ministry declined to comment on this story.
Since the 1950s, the situation has changed.
Although women are still officially prohibited from fighting, this division exists only in words: Modern wars rarely have a clear frontline.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers’ teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contacts with local women in combat zones.
The result: 150 female soldiers were killed between the two wars, two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time for the army to become modern, Berk says.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her lawsuit, three others are being prepared.
At Yale Law School, a veteran legal service seminar is preparing a case against four major military academies on charges of promoting a female-hating atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American War Veterans in Vietnam is preparing a lawsuit against the army centered on the diagnoses of “personality changes” that are made to victims of violence in order to remove them from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the human rights group Women’s Military Action Organization.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Affairs Office in December, accusing it of discriminatory practices in considering applications for pensions from people who claim to have been threatened with sexual assault during service.
Nine separate bills proposing a series of measures were submitted to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs’ Service for the Prevention and Combating of Sexual Violence, 3,158 rape attempts were.
But as is known, attacks are often not, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this figure represents approximately 13.5 percent of the alleged 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
This report, published in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 percent of known cases reached court – twice as low as in the civil justice system.
The applicants in the Berk case call the attacks on them only the first in a series of other injuries.
In the case of Laiman, she the rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times to a bunch of police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the assailant's blood - from a cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Laiman was sitting in front of a judge for a hearing during which she was asked if she had had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive characteristic to the accused, who was ultimately acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” said Lyman.
"I thought I was now giving birth - I ran out of the courtroom with a scream."
“They placed me in a psychiatric department, and when I left, I remember my commander said, ‘This was not a trial against him.
Laiman was ordered to go to a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her personality change, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was fired with an unfavorable wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case put forward by Laiman and her comrades in the lawsuit is a difficult question, says John Terley, a professor of law at the Law School at George Washington University.
However, he notes, “I think they are able to move forward.”
Between them and the verdict lies the doctrine that has been criticized since it appeared.
I have criticized the Feres doctrine all my life.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the incentives and deterrence it imposes on responsibility.
He adds, “The odds are largely against them ... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight with the army on this issue until there is a reform," she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Breivik was an ordinary guy exposing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to committing a mass murder in Norway in July, which killed 77 people, appeared at his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was far from alone on the net: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
It’s easy – you just have to go to Facebook.
“We realized that it’s easy to get along with them,” said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of the recently published report on European cyber populism at the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so large, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use the site’s advertising tool to highlight the demographic group they need with scientific accuracy – something marketers have been doing for several years.
Bartlett’s team spotted half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then pushed them up with ads, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the ad offered the user a survey with questions about their level of education, attitude toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey more than 10,000 participants of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – even without leaving the office.
“It’s an entirely new way of conducting research,” Bartlett says.
Some results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men who are dissatisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, “those who combine their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just hide behind a monitor.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to explore everything in the world – from health issues to social trends that are expressed in ‘Like’, wall posts, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three posts a day, Facebook’s “super-updated information” is triggering a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the title of the site by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the charm of Facebook is that it gives you the opportunity to study people you can’t approach on the street with a notebook.
"In the past, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
“You’d have to join the party and they’d never accept you,” Bartlett says.
“Facebook excludes all of this – you’re addressing them directly.”
Others say that using this site would be possible to identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken feats on Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than students who remained silent about it.
Moreno suggests that student peers, such as their hostel mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who updates drunk status too often.
“You can’t solve a problem without identifying it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
“We’ve found a way to identify children at risk that otherwise’t have been detected.”
Facebook is also constantly extracting various types of data about its users.
The site’s data processing team processed statistics on relationships and Valentine’s Day status, midterm voting in 2010, and the National Happiness Index (mainly using information that they only have access to – cyber-freedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive data collection publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is monitoring them whether they like it or not – in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away from you, the site may process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a study they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined standards for conducting offline research, online data is publicly available.
"I don't think that many users have even thought about what a researcher can observe behind their profiles," says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using public student Facebook pages.
"As far as they could imagine, it was only between them and their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that the study object is extremely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to find out how much information in the user’s profile and page is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selvin says.
That’s why, despite years of technological research, Selvin thinks that a notebook and pen is still the best research tools of those that can be used.
“Nothing can replace going into the real world and communicating with real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about social, and most of the social is still happening offline.”
"Cold and Inhumane": Anders Bering Breivik will appear in public for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to organizing a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first public appearance in a court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and Knights of the Templars of Norway," he said in front of 500 people in court.
“I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I acknowledge my actions, but I do not acknowledge my guilt.”
Judge Torqueil Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech with him, to address the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Neshem also ordered police to detain Breivik for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eyes, others – to make sure that he is held under the castle.
Everyone came here to find answers to their questions.
“I thought he looked cold and inhumane,” one of the survivors told NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but I personally felt a little easier after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivikined calmness and professionalism throughout the hearing and looked in the eyes of journalists and survivors as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange idea that he was part of a large “resistance” movement, the judge ruled that he wasn’t crazy, and said there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be reassured by the fact that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the sorrow and confusion that the whole nation now feels.
“I’d like him to look like a monster, but that’s not the case,” one of the victims’ relatives said.
“It would be much easier if it were so.”
7 Lessons From The Lost Steve Jobs Interview That Will Be Showed In Theatre This Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans can think of as the biggest discovery in a newly discovered interview, which they recalled ahead of the preliminary shows on major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a keen organizer and upgrader of the production process, who believed that many business executives suffered from “the pain of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work ... [but] a great idea is separated from a great product by a huge amount of skilled work.”
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the Nerves’ Triumph TV series about the advent of the personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By that time, it was about 10 years since Jobs was expelled from Apple, and he was already working for his new computer company NeXT in anticipation of the massive development of the Internet.
While a small part of Kringley’s interview was used in the Nerds, he says the original interviews were missing during transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This slightly edited footage formed the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: Lost Interview, which will be released at Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of detailed interviews, Jobs seems unusually prepared here to present his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different moments during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers – reflection of 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems irritated by Kringley’s questions, causing him to move faster to issues or phenomena of greater importance.
In the pre-Pixar, iPods, and iPhones Lost interview, there’s something sinisterly prophetic when Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
It’s one thing to read about posthumous assessments of Jobs’ work, but there’s something vulnerable and inspiring about Jobs, whom we see here, an alarming dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Shortly after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of the seven important findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
“Over the whole time in business, I’ve been constantly asking, ‘Why are you doing this?’ and the answers you always get are, ‘Oh, it’s just done that way.’
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply about business.
This is what I found out.
Jobs continues to detail his attempts to streamline reporting at Apple.
Disturbed by the way expenses were recorded, often starting with “standard expenses” that were taken from the ceiling and then adjusted with “specifications”, he created an automated structure that ensured that they could track business expenses to the smallest details.
A joke about the father:
Jobs details the "blue box" he smashed with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack a phone company and call long distances for free.
Much has been written about the device before, but Jobs’ euphoria here when describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using a telephone machine, ordering a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We reached the globe half a dozen times, and you were shouting at the telephone machine, and it penetrated a minute later into the neighboring telephone machine," Jobs said with a smile.
“We were young and all we learned was that we could make something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We both knew a little, but we could master a small thing that could control a big thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple could ever come up without it.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one famous outcry he and Wozniak practically managed to cope with by calling the Vatican through the blue box at midnight and asking the Pope to call, trying his best to copy Henry Kissinger.
When different members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to an American diplomat, the two burst out of laughter just before the Pope himself was raised to answer by phone.
About the love of technology (and Bill Hewlett’s cold nickname):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts for a frequency meter assembly, he found Bill Hewlett in a telephone directory and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the company’s research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw the “first desktop computer.”
It was the size of a suitcase, it had a small monitor with an electronic-ray tube, and I fell in love with it.
I used to drive at HP as a teenager, and I was rotating around that machine and writing programs for it.
About improvised innovation:
In several interviews Jobs talks about the invention of new products in the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of assembly boards, one buyer asked him to assemble an entire computer.
Working only 30 days on credit, he had to think about assembly and delivery of ready-made devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he encountered when developing a computer mouse:
“I remember the fierce arguments ... they screamed at me that it would take five years [to assemble a mouse that would cost $300], and I was filled with the throat and went out and found a designer.”
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we were able to collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
Companies that lose energy:
Long before he led the revival of Apple, Jobs predicted exactly how many industry leaders would be mistaken in seeing the situation and lose control of their market share.
“Let’s say you’re working at IBM or Xerox, so you’re making the best copier or printer, and what?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn’t get more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who eventually come to the management of companies, and the people who make the product are displaced from the decision-making platform.
The product genius that led to this monopolistic position is displaced by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products – the skill required.
That’s what happened to Xerox.
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
It could be ten times larger, it could be Microsoft of the 90s.
They were defeated by victory.
Innovation as a form of art
“A great idea is separated from a great product by an enormous amount of skilled work...When you unfold a great idea, it changes and grows.”
You will learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises you need to go to – some things you can’t make electronics, glass, robots, or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head—these concepts—combining them all together.
In the end, it’s all about taste—it’s all about trying to express yourself in the best that people have ever produced, and later trying to bring it into what you’re doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We’ve always been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to become the world’s best IT specialists.
Without information technology, they would do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with opponents of the health care law while the court deals with the case
On the day that the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether it would listen to President Obama’s lifting of the health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, celebrated a lunch sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case before the Supreme Court.
The case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions filed.
One issue on the agenda was a petition backed by 26 states challenging the rapid revision of health care passed by Congress last year, a law that united conservative activists across the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, a five-and-a-half-hour turnaround debate is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which will be at the height of the time when the judgment will be announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and argue that the health care law should be repealed will most likely be Paul Clement, who was the deputy attorney general during George W. Bush’s presidency.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-established group constantly advocating conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
The lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court meeting in the case.
He was present, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the health law.
Honourable guests at lunch? – Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have attended the Federalist Society’s events for many years.
This is not contrary to ethical norms.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they obeyed, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “A judge may attend charitable events of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, or be mentioned in the program of such an event.”
Nevertheless, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to the two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the government.
“This overwhelming violation of ethics and indifference to the code contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the General Case.
“The judges drank and ate dinner at the official money-raising campaign with lawyers whose cases are now being considered in court.”
Their appearance and assistance in collecting money for this event undermines all statements of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say they are very willing to confuse court cases with facts such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas’ wife, Ginny, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that it is the ethical issue that arises in relation to Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal service in the Obama administration when the first legal objections against the law were filed at the level of the court of first instance.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case because she was too involved in the defense of the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan did not show that she was going to do so.
Boeing receives $18 billion order for aircraft
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777s and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal is more than $1 billion.
It is hardly news that the company receives an order for 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is the aircraft maker Boeing Co., and the price of all these 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
Equally important is where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, growing gold lived future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest order in the dollar equivalent for commercial aircraft - 50 Boeing 777.
An incredible order came from the airline Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to purchase another 20 aircraft, which will raise the total price to $26 billion, Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Later on Monday, Boeing that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which can boast significantly better fuel economy and passenger convenience.
The price of six aircraft will be more than $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neil Diora.
“The quality of these specific buyers is quite high.”
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Consequently, not only do they have money to pay for planes, but also rising fuel prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest spending items, is not so devastating because the country makes money on high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel aircraft orders when prices rise, Diora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
Emirates’ order strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the wide-range aircraft market and helps prevent rival Airbus SAS’ attempts to undermine its dominance with its A350.
Boeing’s victory at the air show came four months after Airbus said it would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which competes with the 777-300ER.
It postponed its debut to increase the axis load after buyers demanded increased loading capacity and flight range.
Boeing Co shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico's president's sister loses election in Michoacán
Louisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo from the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have failed to run for governor of Micoacan during the fierce state elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers helped slide the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the race for the place of governor of the western state is called Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP.
“The interference of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country,” Louisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview the day after Sunday’s vote.
“They intimidated our candidates, our workers in the elections... They grabbed the urns to vote, set obstacles... and forced people to vote” for the IRP.
The IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She is preparing a return, and winning at Michoacan is an important step in this attempt.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo, it seems, only slightly surpassed Calderon, who headed the ratings until the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the Party of National Action, or PND, headed by her brother, refused to recognize Valléecho as the winner.
Silvano Auréoles, a candidate from the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP, which now owns the governor's seat, came third - a serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of Morelia, denied ties to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoacan for a long time dominated drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the hometown of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence still continues.
The PND mayor was killed a week before the election when he campaigned for Louisa Maria Calderon, and several candidates dropped out of the local election race because of fear.
However, for the IRP, no matter how terrible the Michoacan election looks, the victory will give the party’s driving momentum.
The man who should represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Valléecho and said, “I think this victory should be very encouraging in the run-up to next year.”
ABR persuades Asia to help save Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has ordered India and China to be prepared to help save the euro zone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term downturn that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ABR office in Manila, said the two fastest-growing major economies should "do everything they can" to accelerate the currency bloc's recovery through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that BRIC countries look at Europe’s difficulties “impartially,” and said Asian financial assistance side by side with European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
“It concerns us all.”
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable.”
“So if China and India can help, it must be done.”
The European Monetary Union has been heavily undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing has grown threateningly, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The debt crisis unfolding in Europe has raised fears that it could bring the world economy back into recession, and has led to calls from leading emerging economies to come together to help the euro zone find a solution.
He predicted that any Asian aid would be carried out through the IMF, but said bilateral cooperation — such as the purchase of bonds from the EU’s financial aid fund, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe — provides tremendous negotiating power to Asian partners in Europe.
India’s trade minister, Anand Sharma, said India would “do everything it can” to help the eurozone as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decrease in foreign capital flows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
“We have huge goals and we must maintain a high level of growth.”
“This is not a possible option, it is a prerequisite, because where we will find jobs for tens of millions of our boys and girls.”
Others argue that it makes no sense for emerging economies like India to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own profound economic challenges.
Ashutosh Warshni, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult from a political point of view to provide aid to Europe for India’s 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
“At some point they’ll learn that the Greeks retire at 50 and go to the sea for holidays, and that’s not going to be seen well,” he said.
Lee Hovell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers working in poorly organized, losing enterprises such as railways.
He said the eurozone crisis threatens to have “significant direct consequences” across Asia.
The ABR forecast of 7.5-percent growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now facing “depreciating risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to draw up “emergency plans” to protect themselves from recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon warns of potential defense spending cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned Congress on Monday that expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain response from the Pentagon corridors to the Afghanistan battlefields on the line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already accustomed to cuts of $450 billion over the coming decade, but is now concerned that additional cuts of $600 billion or more could be inevitable if Congress fails to come to an agreement on spending.
“The consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators to Republican John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to agree on the budget and the resulting so-called sequester initiated a general reduction of 23% and the cessation of many new projects.
"Such a sharp reduction, applied so thoughtlessly, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and will seriously damage other modernization attempts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We will also be forced to dismiss many of our staff and, since the cuts will be made so quickly, we will almost have to dismiss staff to the goal.”
“These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will seriously damage the preparedness.”
The cuts will ultimately affect military units, Panetta said.
"Al military funding in Foreign Emergency Operations is not directly affected by the sequestration, military achievements will seriously suffer from a serious collapse in major budgets," Panetta warned.
“The contract personnel will be reduced, which will result in the cancellation of contracts and supervision agreements that support the troops.”
“The staff will be reduced, which will lead to delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted.”
Two senators wrote to Panette 10 days ago asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts in the Defense Ministry.
“The consequences of a sequester in the Department of Defense will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
"We are firmly opposed to these draconian actions," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday evening when they released Panetta's letter.
“It’s not a way out that we can live with, and it’s not a way out that we should impose on ourselves.”
“Sexwestry is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this should not happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter or the recent warnings of senators will lead to a budget compromise or increase the calls to release the Pentagon from cuts, we will see later.
Panetta was absolutely sincere about possible cuts, although he came to work in the leadership of the Pentagon after years of budgetary examinations in Congress and the White House and realizing that he was facing a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a sad picture of what could come next – troops with a shell but without a nucleus.
“This is a ship without sailors.”
“This is a squad without bullets.”
“It’s the wing of an aircraft without adequately trained pilots.”
“It’s a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs with no sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission,” Panetta said in his introductory remarks to the Pentagon.
“It’s a force that suffers from an unstable fighting spirit, poor readiness and unable to fight potential enemies.”
“In fact, it encourages aggression.”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlined new details of how cuts “create significant operational risks: slow the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be the first to deploy and respond anywhere in the world; and lead to unacceptable risks in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects may face obstacles, including those that have already passed tests, and some are only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F-35 strike fighter, a planned new bomber, a new-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal combat ship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marines need to replace the hammer.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say it is a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to Catch a Lie
A quick look at the latest headlines shows how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Kane is busy challenging sexual harassment charges from several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The administration of the University of Pennsylvania was charged with false testimony because they allegedly concealed that a retired football coach raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught when he told U.S. President Barack Obama, with the microphone on, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner presented himself as a fool by denying his outcry, which was quickly disproved by undeniable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with financial manipulation during a campaign involving hiding off extra-marital relationships.
And again, none of those who lived at the time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of fraud at school and college exams are common.
There were instances when teachers gave students answers to the tests in order to have a good assessment of the results of their activities.
Teachers who have to teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
During a day, research shows you can lie from 10 to 200 times.
Now it is assumed that much of this is a lie for salvation.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Detecting lies or deceiving lies is a necessary skill for everyone, both for personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room-like game, for example, where you need to shout “Fall Out!”, lying detection is a serious direction of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been dismantled.
The liars look in the eyes.
They are not always clogged, swirled, red or swirled.
It is not necessary to conclude from this that liars are difficult to notice and difficult to expose.
An experienced liar exposer can get to the truth by observing the structure of claims, mimics, structure of questions, and temporal characteristics.
I’ve spent several years exploring scientific discoveries in the vast and ever-growing segment of knowledge about lies, and it’s clear that lying detection is a modern skill that’s easy to learn and that helps to navigate in our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include recruiting, interviewing, negotiating, or managing.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel free, controlling their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie more about others, usually to protect someone’s feelings, that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried people (but the lie they tell is most commonly obscure).
We also know that if you are perceived as a deceiver, others will feel less guilty by deceiving you.
How do I know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
This is called the “definition of the starting state.”
This helps provide a starting point for evaluating further changes.
Observe the posture, laughter, voice characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know if a person is constantly knocking his legs in a normal state, then you will not make unfair accusations when you see his legs knocking in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and non-verbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of deception.
Fraudsters can fix the upper part of their body when they try to remember their story, they can put their feet in the direction of the door, bend to the exit, change their posture in a certain way, or demonstrate “relief after the interview” – that exaggerated breath of relief and change of posture when all the difficult questions are behind.
Investigators often falsify the end of the interrogation signal to just look at that relief after the interview.
Pay attention to the speech of your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson gave up and used the past time, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, which led to her searches across the country.
Persuading people may also use distancing in speech: “I didn’t have a sexual relationship with this woman ... Miss Lewinsky” or repeat a difficult question altogether.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely captured.
Someone may use a “qualification language” when answering a difficult question: “Well... in truth... as far as I know... as far as I know.”
This makes the response more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magic tool to reveal a lie, but you can master the skill of detecting deception.
These skills will increase everyone’s chances of not becoming a victim of skilled scammers in professional and personal life.
Controversial pipeline plan needs revision after U.S. threatens to postpone its approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf – provoking the anger of trade unions but reassuring environmentalists – the company, which is about to build the pipeline, says it will readily review the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that it would remove the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of the Sand Hills in Nebraska and is confident that the project will still get approval.
The company announced this decision at a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada spokesman Alex Purbas says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for the pipeline, though with a different route.
This comes after the State Department announced last week that it would postpone a decision on the project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sand Hills area and the Ogalala aquifer, a huge underground water reserve.
“This is a real step forward,” said Fox News congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
A new environmental assessment ordered by the State Department is likely to postpone the decision until 2013, after the next year’s elections, although authorities have denied that politics were involved in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama called the decision a call from the State Department and expressed his support.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It is supposed to ship 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to oil refineries in Texas.
To accomplish this, he must cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by unions that hope to create approximately 20,000 pipeline-related jobs.
But lawmakers in Nebraska, who oppose the plan, are considering a bill to accelerate the displacement from the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current Environmental Impact Study revealed that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but a source in the energy industry said the Department’s auditor ordered a separate review of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether the choice of the firm that was hired to conduct the initial research was inappropriate as it was associated with TransCanada.
Patty LaBell sued for allegedly causing child nausea from fear
A New York-based family claims that the disc diva Patti LaBell started roaring in the lobby of their Manhattan home, frightening their young daughter to such an extent that she became sick of fear.
"Lady Marmalade's drawing scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality change, sleep disorder" and "strong fear of strangers," her family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan said.
It happened on November 10, last year, when work scene Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were about to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk descended into the lobby of the building on the Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped at the door and dropped her daughter to the floor for a minute.
“Someone came to me from behind and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing?’ I said ‘yes’ and went to pick her up,” she said.
LaBelle angrily spoke to a pregnant woman.
“She said aggressively, ‘You shouldn’t have left your daughter by the door,’” said Rosanna Monk.
“I told her, ‘I don’t care what you say or think.’”
She became angry and began to use blasphemy—a word on C and a word on F—on elevated tones.
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of the bottle on me.
She said that Geneva was hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you’ve done to my daughter,’” said the mother of the child.
LaBell struck her mother — who still held Genevieve — and her companions had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, Rosanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so much that she was sick, she added.
The family later sent LaBelle a note asking for an apology, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representatives do not respond to calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took up the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money it receives to charity children with cancer.
“The goal is to make Patty LaBelle be held accountable for his actions,” Davis said.
"This behavior is completely unacceptable, especially in relation to a kindergarten teacher with a 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate change has slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopez's reign in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market grew, foreign financing decreased and the economy was weakened.
2011 - the year that will enter the economic history of Sinaloa as associated with the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdes, also called the year of change, which gave rise to great hopes for economic development, but, given the adverse climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, but there was a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February not only led to millions of losses for the agricultural sector, but they also limited the growth opportunities of the state economy, causing an overall 3.6 percent decline in economic activity in the first half of the year, largely due to a historic 31.16 percent drop in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on frozen-affected areas provided by the Mexican Council on Sustainable Rural Development, 835.582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 percent were affected entirely, and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity caused, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters was recorded an accelerated rise in unemployment, from January to March 55.053 residents of Sinaloa were unemployed, with a share of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the share increased to 5.28 percent, and from July to September it continued to grow to 6.19 percent, a share that in terms of the number of people is more than 74,000 unemployed residents of Sinaloa, which is 18.969 people more than in the first half.
Decrease in liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa over the course of the year is discussed by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly, by actions taken in public policy.
“What we are seeing now is a rise in unemployment, which is associated with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market in order to restrict resources, imposed by a law that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, as it’s not easy for people who illegally own dollars to work with them, invest and use them in something,” he said.
Stopped immigration
Lopez Cervantes said there is also a demographic factor in the growth of unemployment.
“The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad in the U.S. has been limited, primarily because of difficulties with entry, and in the second – because, once they enter, they already face a lot of difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people stays and demands jobs here, in the state, as a result of the unemployment rate rises,” he said.
Violation of formal requirements
Sinaloa’s labour market analysis gets worse if you pay attention to the large number of violations that prevail in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the state’s active population is working without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and malformations, another reminder of work in the state is represented by low wages; the state has the lowest wages in the country, according to records from the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloa workers was up to September 5,352 pesos, far below the national average, which is 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of drink
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate, 2011 recorded the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July the state's PII amounted to $630,697 which shows a drop of 87.74 percent from $5,143,312 over the same period last year.
For its part, the State Government’s Ministry of Economic Development recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investment over the year, which mostly came from services companies.
debt
Against the backdrop of the economic downturn, the state government requested a loan of 3 billion pesos in July during the state congress to be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revitalize the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved locally, and debt benefits were not expected in any sector of the state's economy until November.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdes demonstrates the lack of capabilities of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said there was a lack of consensus between the various sectors, including the state government itself, over the course of 2011.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, there is a lot of work to do to recover the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have not been able to coordinate the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Slowdown of the economy
Lopez Loredo said events such as early frosts this year stopped the state’s economy and its efficiency and growth were limited.
“Low economic volumes are the result of several events, including the frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that is not getting fast enough to create economic dynamics that allow us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year we close it below our expectations,” he said.
Revision of direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, said the state needs to continue its most dynamic production activity.
"Overall, we have found that we have worked on this, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, it is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The upcoming work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better direct government efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, in terms of economic development there is little progress, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has demonstrated progress in its own way of conducting public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is beginning to get involved in the work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government is aware that there is a lot to be done," he said.
He was sentenced for 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a 100-day fine – such a sentence was issued to the citizen of Navolato for holding eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General’s Office said that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valencia Sandoval, was convicted of a crime against health, in this case possession of marijuana for the purpose of distribution.
According to the case AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during a patrol on Cypriano Valdez Street, in front of post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navalato.
The drug dealer was driving a white car pickup, in which he carried a black bag in a car box, and on the passenger seat a small backpack, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seized item was transferred to the disposal of the Second District Court, and the accused continues to remain detained in the Centre for Support of Legal Consequences of Crime.
Contributions to work.
Public works related to programs such as Homeland, Saving Public Spaces and 3x1 for Migrants are at risk of remaining unfinished or delayed for a long time due to lack of funds, Miguel Angel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that while working programs have so far been developed, they are at risk as the state government is unable to make corresponding contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos for all three programs.
He noted that the total funding of all three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the staff must contribute 25 percent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality provided resources for work, so there is still a possibility of delay with their completion.
"They have to invest 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, they didn't give us a penny, when from the beginning of July they had to give us a portion," he said, "to not postpone, we started work and they have made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Hesus Aguilar Padili, the state did not make the contributions it had to make, so at the beginning of its reign, the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that was not provided in that case by the state administration.
“This happened to us in the previous administration because the state didn’t have the financial capabilities to participate and the programs continued to evolve, and this year, in order to get access to these programs, we need to find resources to cover what the state has left to owe,” he explained.
While the state authorities have an obligation to deliver these resources, he says the request was made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to increase efforts so that the interests related to them come as soon as possible.
“They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, they didn’t give us a penny.”
Mexican Court Approves ‘Transition to Digital Television’ in 2015
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that have encountered the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court has rejected the constitutional claims raised by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which postpones the so-called "digital television transition" from 2021 to 2015, because there were no eight votes needed to cancel it.
A minority of the four ministers, including the Chairman of the Court, Juan Silva Messa, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers by issuing a decree detailing the action for the transition to digital ground television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes needed for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because regulating radio and television programmes is a law-enforced right for the Federal Commission on Telecommunications (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only Salvador, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the House of Representatives held two constitutional debates to disprove the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the meeting of ministers, it was also decided to reject the request of the House of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the draft in the sense that the federal executive power cannot determine by general rules the measures to which the state administration should prepare.
"I also don't think that if this happened, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that planning public policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, has to do with the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, to manage the state.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals – one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years – has led to better use of radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality, and more channels.
Delaying the transition, he said, would mean delaying the benefits of digital transformation, which involves meeting societal needs that have not only a technical dimension, “since it covers economic, social, political and national security issues.”
These questions, he said, “require the work of the entire system, formed on the principle of state economic management, includes a group of authorities, which the Constitution unites into state executive power.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and have done so with the help of the executive, despite the presence of highly specialized technical facilities.
From this it cannot be concluded that the government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of Congress, ensures in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoacan analyze the possibility of counting "voice for voice"
The difference between the first and second seats in the governor’s elections is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes coming from 879 out of the total of 6,074 protocols.
The possibility of counting “vote-by-vote” is real with regard to this year’s election process in Michoacán, where, according to data obtained from the Preliminary Results Program (PPRV), the difference between first and second place in the governor’s elections is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes coming from 879 out of the total of 6,074 protocols.
In the light of this, the Chair of the General Council of the Michoacan Election Institute (IMI), Maria de Los Angeles Lyanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, November 9, the electoral body approved a package of principles to align local rules with the federal electoral reform.
As it should be recalled, Michoacán did not adopt the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Law on Electoral Rights, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication within the deadlines specified in the law in the Official Journal of the State, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice (SJJ) ruled on the constitutional claim raised by the local legislature and called the vote of a representative of the state on constitutional reform "invalid and illegal", as he has no right to "allow or support them."
In an interview on the possibility of “vote-for-vote” Maria de los Ángeles Liaanderal argued that with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council of the IMM it would be possible to submit a partial or full count of the votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, partial recalculation of one or more electoral urns may be carried out under the conditions that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no protocol of voting and counting of documents in the urn or it is not with the chairman; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
Furthermore, a total recount of votes in all polling stations may take place when there is indication that the difference between the alleged winner of the elections in question and the second-place candidate is less than or equal to one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from a representative of the party and/or coalition that put out the second of the aforementioned candidates.
A total recalculation of votes shall also be made if, at the end of the ordinary count, it is established that the difference between the winner and the second-place candidate is less than or equal to one percent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate took the second-place, in the event that electoral urns that were taken into account in the partial recalculation will be excluded.
It is worth noting that in such a situation are the elections in Morelia, where, according to the PPRV, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, not even counting 129 votes out of the total number in the 923 protocol.
His Last Will
His dust will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot, Felipe Basio Cortés, arrived in his hometown of Saltillo on Sunday evening; an examination and a resting mass was held on Monday.
According to the family, the last will of the Lieutenant Colonel was that his dust be dispersed in the mountains of Sapalinama.
After accepting condolences along with other people who died in the disaster, the Basio Cortés family returned to the capital Coahuila on board the Mexican Air Force aircraft, closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the dust of the Lieutenant Colonel arrived in the chapel, located on the Boulevard of Nazario Ortiz García, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he passed the examination at the Santiago Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and a football team whose member was Felipe Basso while studying in high school.
"His desire was to return to Saltijo, and to let his dust be wasted in the mountains of Sapalinama, he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Cortés Basio, the pilot's sister.
In her opinion, the Lieutenant Colonel has fulfilled all his dreams, she believes he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, son and a loving brother devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortés Basio left the city of Saltillo at a very young age to enroll in the Aviation College in Sappana, Halisco.
Some did not believe him, they said he had a headache even in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, “Once he arrived in Salillo, the whole family wanted to greet him, like when he brought Martha Saigon to Salillo.”
The young man recalls that even when he was seven, he drove to Sappan for his relative's diploma ceremony, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: driving an airplane.
He is taken to the last road.
Gun shots were fired in honor of Colonel Felipe Cortés Basso of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Governor Jorge Torres López, people from the village and state government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force themselves, the heads and pupils of the Technical High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and made successes in both studies and sports, led him to the last path.
Basio Cortés was killed recently when the helicopter he was operating crashed, along with the provincial government secretary, José Francisco Blake Moreau, and six others, all representatives of the ministry.
At 18:05 the remains of Basio Cortés (cremated), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral bureau of members of the Mexican Air Force led by Major James Martinez, on the esplanade of the training school, where he was already awaited by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned on NL Cadereita farm
A few hours before the detection, the military authorities showed in the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different body parts with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereita Himenes, Nuevo León.
The discovery was discovered on the 1.5 km highway of Cadereita towards Santiago, on a hill in a commune known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by noticed that in a village house, whose walls were painted in beige and brown, the gates were barely open.
Looking inside, literally three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, they immediately notified the relevant authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow t-shirt with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in a white t-shirt.
Almost one meter away was the body of another man, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no guilds on the spot.
On the fence of the village house there are signs addressed by one organized crime group to another, also in it and in the gates there are several bullet holes.
11 captured in Cádiz
The Ministry of National Security presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereita, and who are charged with kidnapping, murder, “fraud” and secret burial.
On November 11, eight people were arrested in the Los Alveros colony, and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a phone, demanding to become members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another incident occurred on November 12 at 6:00 a.m., when military personnel were patrolling in the village of Old Rancho in Kadereite, when they saw a car without a number mark with two men in the cabin.
After stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 ammunition.
Later, after these statements, on November 13, at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Pravda, who, seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of General Taran, Hina and Kadereita.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the president of Italy tomorrow to present a new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian president on Wednesday to present a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and harmed the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive body will take up its positions.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to reaffirm my full confidence in the ability of our country to get out of this difficult period,” the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not say directly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles were overcome.
“The structure is now well outlined,” he said.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual as Italy struggled with a political and financial crisis that brought their debt to a critical level.
The administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve the austerity package required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
Based on pressure on Monti to hurry, the volatile markets set Italy’s 10-year BTP bond revenue above 7 percent, a level that Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after meeting with Monti: “We said we will actively support this government.”
We believe this government is Italy’s last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monti's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts should lead to a good outcome," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the government majority consisting of technocrats that Monty forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support for reforms that will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts could lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has increased pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He will end his series of meetings on Tuesday evening.
Monty was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, which allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short pause at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the value of Italy’s debt has now reached a critical level amid uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will be successful.
Saving Italy with a public debt of €1.8 billion would be too much for today’s euro zone financial defenders.
Monti said his government will exist until the next election scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to reform before scheduling new elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be composed only of technical specialists, proof of their dissatisfaction with the fact that the process is affected by the financial situation.
Political sources said mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicated the attempt to include political figures.
Spanish players have more experience than Ticos.
Of the 22 players registered in Spain, 10 have already played 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 registered players played 50 matches.
A slight contrast to Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 players invited by both countries for a friendly match today at 3:05 p.m. at the San Jose National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one in the monthly FIFA ranking, have a whole list of class A qualifying games, Tricolor has only defender Michael Uman as the only one to have held 50 international games.
This figure was achieved last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernandes stadium.
Spanish players playing in the All-Star League and strong clubs in the Premier League of England have been very active in the league and local cup competitions during this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and Champions League.
It is worth adding to this the experience of the Spanish Fury in a difficult qualification in the Euro or World Championship.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the list is headed by Spanish national goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javier Hernández, the player of Barcelona, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Javier were recognized as the best at the UEFA last week along with another player of the Iberian team, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and Shalke bomber Raul Gonzales with 102.
Almost approaching the hundred, Carlos Puyol with 97 games.
Javier Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres - with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Iniesta - with 62, Cesc Fabregas - with 61 and David Silva - with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, next to Michael Umana, left side Junior Diaz with 48 matches and bomber Brian Ruiz - with 45.
Further, only five overcame the line in 30 games: Kaylor Navas with 31, Randall Asofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and José Luis Lopez with 35.
The remaining .
More than 30 matches in Spain have been played by Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiola (31).
In the team with less than 30 outings on the pitch is Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest did not even reach 20.
While Nacho Moraal has only four games, and Hordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not made their debut yet.
The leading player of Spain is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who scored more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernandez and three times as much as Roy Murray and Parks.
Quintet included the country on tour in honor of twenty years of career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Amant of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There’s been more than 20 years of waiting, but the group says it’s also a dream that has become a reality for them to play in this country.
This was a statement by bassist and founder, Jeff Amant, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is on a tour in South America to celebrate their 20th anniversary and will make their only stop in Central America on Sunday, 20th.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Los Angeles team The X and the local group Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, a full decoding of which is available online at The Nation.
For your Costa Rica fans, is it a dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream fulfilled and for us too.
This is only our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything is going well.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once – on vacation, it’s a beautiful country, and I think we’ll be able to stay there for a few days.
We are very happy to bring our music there.
I’m asking because there’s some commitment to the band; fans live in tension in the days before the concert.
What would you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played in the past 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We had some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that brought us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you learn about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfing friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua as well as Mexico, these are great places to surf, here’s how we learned about it from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say that you did a grand show with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for a performance in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there before, we have no limits on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible with the most varied songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a wide variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does it go?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven’t played for a while, it keeps us in tone and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and so I think it makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour you celebrate 20 years of career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you have done?
Yes of course.
First, I think none of us ever imagined that we would be in a rock band and the fact that we’ve been doing it for more than 20 years makes it like a dream.
We are delighted with our luck and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We’re happy to drive to places in the world where we’ve always wanted to go.
Everything goes very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the flower of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great collectives.
We’re good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and that’s unusual.
From time to time, one group appears from one city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in one city.
We are proud and honored to be part of a group from Seattle.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we’re happy to be friends with all of them and for us it’s an honor to be part of the Seattle sound that turned out.
It is also very strange that a group like yours stays together and in the same composition for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups exist.
First, I think we are lucky that we are still alive, and secondly, we care about others.
We’re all very close friends and, thanks to this, we’ve also opened up musical paths that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other’s music, and everything could not have been better.
Your attitude to the word fame was difficult; but thanks to your success you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it became easier to find balance.
We take care not to be too long on the tour because it’s easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you must respect music and what made it, not deciding to be famous and to be a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we’re writing really good songs and it was great at the beginning.
We were the band for almost three years and didn’t release a single album until Andy’s death.
There was a lot of disappointment because it lasted so long, and the most important thing is that we are still close friends with Bruce (Ferweser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a photo, I think of the incredible person Andy was, and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and more.
He was a wonderful man and we miss him.
The local group Las Robertas will be responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you are familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and so you chose her to discover?
Yes, the producers sent us a few video offers, and it was a band that we liked the most so we can’t wait to see what Las Robertas can offer live, and it should be very exciting.
Why do you constantly change the words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
This is a question to Eddie Vedder, so I don’t know.
He sings it and I think he uses the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
So many of them.
Among the first to come to mind, Geyser Butler, John Entwistle, CJ Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCartney, Chuck Duckowski ...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed inining the relevance of the grunge, despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel some sort of detachment from the word grandz.
When I think about it, it reminds me of bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came up at the same time, and if it matters now, I think it’s wonderful because it’s music worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney are making music now better than ever.
At first your music was darker, but now it has become more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a few songs on the album that may seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound a bit positive.
From both, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs were very dark.
I think when you’re growing up and there’s been some kind of trauma in your life and you’ve lost a family member or a friend, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.

Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a state hospital on Tuesday to be examined for the loss of muscle strength observed in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told television channel N that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that, in his opinion, Fujimori should be a candidate for the mercy for humanitarian reasons; however, he said he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He underwent four operations on tongue cancer, lost 18 pounds in weight, which was added to other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007 at the National Special Operations Police Department.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for killing 25 people by an army destruction force that acted secretly in the first years of his reign.
Mukhika travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and businessmen will arrive on Tuesday to visit Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to start negotiations on political issues in the region.
Mukhika will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the most important point of a comprehensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "favourable for the exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations", as the leadership of the South American country published on its website.
According to local media reports, Mukhika is seeking Calderon’s support for Uruguay in the incident with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that sparked Uruguay's protest and the withdrawal for consultations of his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20, a group of the most developed and developing countries, since November, and has essentially had a tax information exchange agreement with the South American country since January this year to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to accelerate the conclusion of tax exchange agreements in order to leave the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s “grey list” of countries that do not enjoy international standards of tax cooperation.
As for the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The water pipeline will be three-dimensional with Super Mario 3D Land
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Pitch from the evil legs of Bouser, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The edition, which will appear in stores around the world this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of the portable Nintendo 3DS console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
“Mario is a hero who has to tell you how the stereoscopy without glasses will work,” said Nintendo’s head of press service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during a game presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez said Super Mario 3D Land is "Nintendo's first video game specifically designed for this platform" because so far successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations of existing games.
A spokesman for Nintendo said that despite the existence in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once started, most experts will go "in the second round" to the levels of the game, which this time is more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that affects only the depth of action, but which needs to play in three dimensions to overcome a variety of obstacles and "not give in to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional invasion of Super Mario also marks the hero’s return to a portable console, which hasn’t happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo flashes the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from previous games, a whistleblower must go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Pitch.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the "playing" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo’s extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process for Alfonso Portillo had begun to hold him accountable in the United States for a conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This ends the process by which Guatemala responded to the request of a northern country that demanded the extradition of Portillo to be tried there.
At a press conference, Kolom said his decision was linked to the independence of the judicial and executive authorities, considering that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his tenure he did not "apply hands" to legal decisions and took all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
Along with Portillo Sergio Ruano, Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious bodily injury, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did shows the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts were exhausted to prosecute the former head of state from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court, Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal status in Guatemala and guarantees his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of wasting Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense during the presidential term, which was a process preceding extradition, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education.
The outcomes of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organization are important: 6,000 young people vulnerable to social exclusion have helped overcome difficult situations over this quarter of a century.
This is worth adding to more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the results at a ceremony held in the premises of the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people came.
Trinijove was born next to Trinidad Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with lack of education, lack of work and drug problems or vulnerable to marginalization.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have been cooperating with the association over the past 25 years.
Different political representations during the elections showed the unified nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Following the Chairman of the General Assembly, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Hordey Pucholl, the ceremony was attended by former Socialist Education Advisor, Ernest Maragall, and former mayor lieutenant and current ecosocialist, municipal council member, Ricardo Goma.
Also appeared in Fabra I Coats the current social welfare and family consultant, Joseph Lewis Claris and La Caixa social work CEO, Haume Lanaspa.
He said Trinijove was born at a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base."
The Chairman cited Trinijove as an example of fighting bad circumstances and instilling hope in people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not new to the organization and the work it has done,” he said.
The building where mass parties were held was evacuated.
The captors occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupants left the building yesterday at noon without fighting.
It seems that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors living in House 51 on Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people volunteered yesterday at noon to leave the building they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that irritated neighbors, by a court decision without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
“From this point on, there will be pass control,” the manager said.
The squatters, who seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest were inhabited, appropriated all the electricity and part of the water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially bottles of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a site for mass parties that lasted up to two days and annoyed the owners.
Right behind the building is the nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income has dropped by 80%.
The club owner says the buildings invaders dragged her into unfair competition, as they sold drinks for three euros, while the club sold for 10.
In addition, the owner of the disco had to respond to the complaints of neighbors about noise, although, as she noted, the noise was caused not by the club visitors, but by the residents of the squat and, above all, those who attended the parties that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which increased, as the angry neighbors said.
The club’s owner said the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and it’s been nine months since he “forgives” her for paying the rent.
The city police also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors over the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP municipality group, adviser Alberto Fernand Diaz, demanded last week “immediately evacuate the building to address the problems of coexistence and common spirit that appeared in neighbors and the degradation in the area.”
The popular leader explained that until the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months squatters have invaded all floors and virtually every room and that some of them have been breached.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to stand firmly against the unculture that is being created in the building."
So, yesterday, police evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30, police headed out to Montreal Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree to the possibility of competition after discussions about contributions
Municipal contest at 16 doors resumed debate on Colserola's role in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the rise of the now extinct Capital Corporation of Barcelona (SCC), this administration printed promotional leaflets for Colserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park in the capital of Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987, the park again took place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that are oriented not north-south, but up (mountain) down (sea).
The positioning of Colserola as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild cock in the role of a Yogi bear.
This was the case until, in September, the board announced a massive competition consisting of 16 competitions at many other gates in Colserola.
Under the gates is the idea of the park, undoubtedly.
Either so, or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
The question is one: Colserola? park or mountain?
The competitions, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are a topic for discussion by all Barcelona architects.
This is hardly the most recurring topic discussed when two members of this clan of chosen people recognize each other in the elevator.
And this fact leads to one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona say and the scientists who attended.
Miguel Rodan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bajona: competition is appropriate
For Roland, after reaching the coastline it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "front side of the mountain" when the proposal of Ildefon Serda, the mountain with the green apples, was not implemented.
The biggest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Especially because of its excellent availability.
Colserola is more complicated,” says the architect, for whom the title “Colserola Gate” contains a “verbal trap”: we should not think of them “as an entrance to the park, but as a limitation of some zones where we must act.”
Modolo, like Roland and Bayona with experience in urban construction, called the proposal a “intellectual challenge” with “some dangers.”
The risks arising from the “uncertainty of forecasting the public space” after the experience of the 80s, which ended on the Forum’s site with “his swallow song”.
The first fear is the limitation of the boundaries where you can build.
“Limiting something is preparing for the next step,” means transition.
“We need to think about new urban planning tools because the current [in terms of the General Capital Plan (GSP)] can lead to real trouble.”
More closely to the case, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, rather than" as a purely topographic matter.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside of Calcerola that “does not be missed by the ears,” although he is grateful for the opportunity that the municipality offers his profession to join this project “from the beginning.”
And moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a gap that allows architects to enter into debate, but “he doubts” whether this technical profile is what should guide the interdisciplinary teams (“success,” he claims) that should have been created: “Architects should only be a tool.”
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that asks the title of this part is complicated, as the rules of the competition lack a general view of Colserola: "Sixteen intersecting competitions have been announced," he says, "in the sense of sea-mountain, but there is no longitudinal reading here to see and understand the area as a whole."
This makes it possible to participate in at least 16 competitions.
On the other hand, a project for a single gate can be crossed by program and definition with an architect’s project for a neighboring gate.
From your point of view, the dozen board ensures that the strip directly above Ronda de Dalt should provide in its entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and green.
Casino Forgives Jonas Larrazabal and He Will Be Released
After 72 days of settlement, the court representative of Red Casino forgave the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in the trial against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazabal will be released after his legal representative, Red Casino, has given him a pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which is conducting the extortion trial against the mayor’s brother.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, posted a series of photos and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded from him to pay an economic contribution to allow the authorities of Monterrey a secret operation in the gambling house.
After public conviction, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on September 2, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Inheritance Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He stayed there for 49 days, following the instructions of the second move ban order after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereita allegedly for extortioning half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours there in a prison with an average degree of isolation of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving in the municipal prison in San Nicolás, Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yanes, who said that after two months of investigations, proof of Jonas’ guilt was sufficiently apparent, such as charging 1.5 million pesos from bookmakers in exchange for permission for the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, stood before Judge José Luis Pesina to ask for pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region so that he could be released in the next hours.
During the trial, the public prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez if he had compensated for the damage and who of the gambling house’s partners gave pardon, although the lawyer tried not to voice his name.
Based on the record 197/2011, legal pardon has been granted to Jonas Larrassabal, and thereafter no statements can be made regarding the trial that was planned against him; nor will any compensation or punishment be required.
After hearing the lawful representative of the bookmakers, almost at 15:50, it was ordered to immediately release Larrazabal Breton.
A court officer, Jorge Yanes, went to the San Nicolás municipal prison in Garza to inform Jonah that he was lawfully forgiven and his case would be closed.
He shall also notify him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionisio Perez Hacomé talks about the details of the disaster in which the Interior Minister, Francisco Blake, and seven others were killed.
The Ministry of Communications and Transportation (MTR) that the results obtained on the accident that killed Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people showed that the helicopter hit the ground directly in a state of complete integrity, without the pilot trying to make an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Hakome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft got up, the pilot found out that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"Elements that appear to indicate that the ship had several contacts with the ground, wings came into contact with trees at 25 meters, where the vehicle lost its flowing."
He also that the vessel was intended for 19 people, respectively, it met the necessary requirements for the transport of people.
He also said that studies conducted in the impact area did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
“In the study it is that there are no components of the ship elsewhere, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which satisfied the corresponding requirements of passenger transportation.
The ground in this place has a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
By now, the secretary said, the main thing is to get results as soon as possible; however, the study may take several months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, general director of airports and auxiliary services, said the presidential helicopter was controlled at cruise speed during the strike and that it happened on soft rising ground.
“This information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal flight manoeuvre at the time of the impact,” he said.
At a press conference, SCT owner Perez Hakome listed six important elements in the investigation:
The visual flight:
According to aviation rules, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must have visibility during flight and landing.
The weather conditions:
AICM reports identified suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft headed to the border area between Mexico City and the state of Mexico, where layers of clouds were observed at low altitudes.
The selected routes:
It is possible that due to cloudy conditions, the team was looking for a zone of lower altitude and greater visibility in the valley of Kuernaka.
Place of strike.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record from the radar of the aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change of direction of flight.
Distribution of debris on a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the strike occurred on the front and side lines.
The scattered debris makes it clear that the helicopter collided with the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion.
In the zone of the disaster there are still unfound evidence in the ship's debris, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent studies suggest that there may have been multiple contacts with the earth.
During work on the site, pieces of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the ground has a slope from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After careful examination of a larger area than the outlined area near the crash site, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, reinforcing the assumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity.
MSS Announces Obesity Gen Search Program
Social protection leads research into obesity genes in children and young people; it is supported by IPN experts
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young people, which is called the "Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescence" protocol, which will provide a count of signs associated with overweight.
In his statement, the head of the Medical Research Division in Biochemistry of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Center of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multi-disciplinary team of therapists, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been assembled.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Health (NIPH) and the Center for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (whether prescribed or not) is invited to participate by going to the MSSI sports centers participating in the study, in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children will be conducted every Saturday, from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began to be carried out in the sports center in Quatémoc (in the west of Mexico), and from October 8, the events are held in the sports center in Nassaualkhoiotle (east of Mexico).
Once the target of attracting between 500 and 600 children is reached, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Centre (South Mexico) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (North Mexico).
He explained that the aim of this study is to understand the components and importance of genetics in relation to obesity development and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
On November 14, World Diabetes Day will be celebrated, and the main goal is to gather three thousand children and adolescents aged between 6 and 14 with the permission of their parents and under their supervision to fill in individual nutritional questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and waist circumference), blood pressure and glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin levels, and genetic analysis (to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity) will be carried out.
Cruz Lopez said the study reflects health professionals’ concerns about anxious weight gain among children.
In medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006, it is stated that in just 6 years there was an increase: in the case of boys, 77 percent suffered from obesity, in the case of girls, 47%; in the case of overweight, there was also a significant increase," said MSSI specialist.
He said that the justification of searching for markers is based on the fact that the country’s population differs from other peoples in its genetic history.
He that on average a Mexican is 65 percent offspring of American Indians, 30 percent offspring of Europeans, and five percent offspring of Africans, and this condition has affected genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the main consequence of obesity genetics is the body’s inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories), and it is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the immediate benefit for participants is a comprehensive assessment of children, which can reveal whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on the neck and forearms means the likelihood of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is treated confidentially, the doctors pass it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and lifestyle changes that need to be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main causes that provoke overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of the TV, and using transportation on short distances instead of walking.
This is also due to high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sweetened drinks and carbohydrates (tamale, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic predisposition analyzed in this program.
Asphalt UNAM can avoid cracks
Raphael Errera, a researcher at the UNAM chemical faculty, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality, resistant to environmental and temperature impacts.
If the signals sent by the road cover were taken into account, about 200,000 holes would need to be repaired for each rainy season in the capital district in the Valley of Mexico, says Rafael Errera Nahera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, and adds that if the process of building andining the asphalted road cover is correct, the number of holes can be reduced or even reduced to zero.
In his lecture, The Technology View of the Hole, read as part of the International Year of Chemistry, it is that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture with characteristics close to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Errera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen can be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, like in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and thus counter the formation of holes.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some with a high molecular mass called asphaltens, and others with a low molecular mass called maltens, which together give the road cover its characteristic viscous and elastic behavior.
The viscous elastic behavior of bitumen lies in the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius itins a solid state, while at very low temperatures bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not constant, but varies over the course of the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, said the chemical engineering specialist.
The scientist observed that the streets of Mexico are mostly covered with flexible coating, which is made up of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the top layers is bitumen, made up of small stones lowered into bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up this coating, he said, is immersed in bitumen.
When driving vehicles and putting effort, this helps the forces to be distributed very well along the road.
If it were modified asphalt, they would be distributed even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt coating, he added, the last layer is placed, which is called a layer of wear, which is made of fine stone, actually sand also immersed in the asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact the wheels of the transport, it should have greater resistance than the asphalt coating and provide road friction.
Being part of the road cover that will receive and spread these efforts, the wear layer also requires a proper thickness, and it is necessary to take into account the material from which it is made.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the condition of the asphalt.
When the soil is wet, water penetrates into the coating and it is difficult for it to get out of there, this causes the softening of all layers of the coating and, consequently, the formation of holes.
When a hole is formed, he said, the wear layer is worn first and only then this affects the bitumen, but the damage does not occur instantly, this is a process that should be paid attention to at the first signs of current repair programs.
Also a member of the National System of Researchers explained that the transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of coating should always be related to the transport load and it is necessary to ensure compliance with this requirement to prevent the frequent appearance of holes.
Raphael Errera said that much is still to be studied and done about bitumen, such as bitumen emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries and even help to repair holes with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate from Valerie to become the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serena Melina Ramirez from getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valerie has won the title of Princess 14 times.
Once again, Vallee del Cauca has only wanted to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content to be on the podium of the winners with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her the new princess of Colombia.
Taking into account the result achieved last night in Carthage, where Miss Atlantica won the crown and the skipper, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingos (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alessate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Laila Blanche (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonela Pineado (1990), Diana Ibel Romero (1993), Hyeye Alhure Garces (2000), Catalina Hilda (2007), Garni Stephane Alessandro (2008).
The question many are asking now:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favourite, who in each of the performances demonstrated that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, not just so she was elected the Queen of Police and the Most Beautiful Person by Vogue - titles held by the Queen, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalya Navarro, who received the Crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to convincingly answer the question "What book characterizes you and why?", asked by Martin Murillo Gomes of the Literary Society Let's Honor.
She answered the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it’s a form of culture, and I definitely believe that the book that characterizes my childhood – Little Prince – is a pretty deep book.
Today I am reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; also at this moment I am reading the book of Irina Nemirovskaya, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called The Heat of Blood.
A response that did not like the jury because of the term "cultivation" and, secondly, because it did not specifically explain how each of the quoted books characterizes it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and satisfied with her outcome: "The universe is wise, what is going to happen is happening."
And you all, please read at least a little, “The Little Prince” is a great book.
Among the voiced hypotheses – Valerie burned out of favoritism.
A Bogotá reporter suggested that because she was preferred, she was greeted with applause, and she was the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Ostery's culinary competition, the audience vote for the best national costume, and Queen Mother), "which aroused the jealousy of other candidates, provoked stress in the queen, and as a result she did not shine on the stage."
And this was noted during her first appearance in a swimsuit at Hilton Beach and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noticeable that she lacked the strength and energy demonstrated by the representatives of Magdalene and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter on RCN’s “Like at Home” program, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess “means that the candidate who wins more awards during the contest doesn’t become the queen.”
In addition, Valerie’s representative recently avoided communicating with the press and this was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valerie failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That’s why two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Dotti said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
“Beauty alone is not enough for Miss Colombia, we have to look not only at the appearance, but also focus on public awareness, before they take part in the contest, they already have to be involved in the projects,” she said.
There is also the assumption that the representative Valerie sinned with defects on the buttocks and fibrosis that was visible on her stomach, but this is controversial, as the jury especially noted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", considering her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The counselor of the kings, Jorge Hernan Orosko, notes that Melina had not the best body, which was better, "but the problems of abdominal fibrosis, which were not very noticeable for me, made her lose her glasses on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Ojos of the Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she underwent surgery.
“Operations are good, but Valerie does not know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was first presented by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, a brutal prediction came true last night, saying it was the damn that Raymond gave Melina as compensation for losing the pleasure of receiving the crown.
So or not, the fact is that today Melina begins the year of reign, not as a queen but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions specified directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the contest in Carthage, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
This was the work of the man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A Cali criminal came into history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI criminalist Kali entered history as the man who confirmed the identity of FARC leader Alfonso Kano by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminals working at CTI, this week it was the turn of Elizar Gonzales, a man from Puerto Texas who spent 21 years in the field of prosecution.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzales worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to traverse the jungle for more than five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Vallée and after graduating from the relevant courses he became a specialist in the field of forensics, where he studied the friction of the skin, i.e. palms and thighs.
In the week of Elizar’s operation to identify a man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take off his clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was approaching.
On Friday night he arrived in a helicopter from Cauca to Palmyra.
He knew he would need to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who was leading the world’s oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten photographs of Guillermo Leon Saenz’s fingerprints (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team to the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it by its appearance; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses, and much thinner.
Fingerprints are not false.
Using magnifying glass, ink, blade and lamp, Elizar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the photographs.
His eyes did not deceive: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, a spokesman for Puerto Texas was asked to confirm to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinson that it was the head of the RVSK.
Searching for fingerprints
For the Dactyloscopy Specialist of the Sijin Division of Kali, the recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos by Elizar Gonzales at the press conference on Operation Against Kano is significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a rigorous science, without mistakes, it can play a key role in revealing crimes.
In addition to identifying bodies, fingerprinting specialists are involved in investigating crimes such as theft and murder, and identifying detainees.
When detained, many criminals have fake passports or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in the case of the theft he had to take a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief relied on his hands to seize a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are hard to work with because they are not convenient surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a picture of the entire palm and identify the criminal who was involved in several thefts,” he says.
Fingerprints also help exclude or establish suspect involvement in murder-related cases.
Recently, a dead man was found with bottles of liquor around him.
During the investigation, it was established that a relative may have been suspected of committing the crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
While this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was on the scene of the murder.
A fingerprint specialist from CTI explained that a chemical or physical reagent is being applied to the places where there are fingerprints.
When they appear, a scarf or tape is used to remove them.
After that, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered in the register.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the TV program about CSI.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not everything you touch leaves a mark.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
“Angry people” challenge New York authorities
Hundreds of protesters stormed a camp in front of Zuckotti Square.
Some of the protesters listened to the court’s decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and headed to the park nearby.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried again to penetrate, under the protection of a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to seize another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered near Зукотти Square, where they wanted to get thanks to a court order that allowed “irritated people” to break up a camp on the square, while the other part of the movement responded to the upheaval by seizing a park in the north of the city, where further arrests were carried out.
“Our idea is that once the court does not allow us to break up the camp in the square, we will break up the camp somewhere else and continue the legal struggle for a return to Zuckotti and through peaceful sitting strikes and demonstrations,” said Mark Brey, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Brey explained that the response of “angry people” to the evacuation of the tent town, which was ordered personally by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, came to court, where judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing protesters to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, “indignant people” took over a new park located at the site of the merger of the central streets of Channel Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and which is owned by the Trinity Church parish.
They could have occupied the place for at least an hour, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Brey could not name the exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also in bracelets.
The organization says several hundred people stood with tents in the place where a delegation of religious leaders went to show support to members of the movement, trying to act as a mediator in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuckotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed in anticipation of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday to consider the legality of today’s morning protests.
Some of the protesters heading there carried and distributed copies of the court order at the same time and even gave those copies to the police guarding the square, which led to “some small clashes,” Brey said, who said some police beat the protesters.
The ruling prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Occupy Wall Street movement and forcing "laws that were issued after the seizure began, or prohibiting demonstrators from re-accessing the park with shops and other property used before."
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that the city had suspended the opening of public spaces because of the court order and the demonstrators were informed about it, but local laws do not allow them to set up tent shops and sleeping bags again.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zukotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out, and the decision was made because the protesters “violated the law.”
Bloomberg said he ordered the cleaning of the square as it became "a place where people came not to protest, but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm others" as "some were threatened" and neighbors feared "for the deterioration of quality of life".
The evacuation this morning was disgusting and shows that in the depths of his heart, Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” added a spokesman for the movement, who condemns the mayor for “disrespecting freedom of speech.”
The Wall Street Capture officials also said they intend to organize "great rallies" on Thursday in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions to commemorate the last two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, she will appear in the television show "Christmas of Russell Peters" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in "The Great Repair", a rescue worker in "Saving Malibu", Bannie in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
Private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with crooner Michael Buble and other prominent Canadians will appear on the "Christmas of Russell Peters" on December 1, as a very special Mary.
CTV today presented footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known for a widely distributed online home pornographic video, where she figures along with her then-husband, the drummer of the Mötley Crüe group Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll depicting Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently performed as the host of Charlie Sheen's "My Cruel Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears in the role of Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, in the special Christmas show CTV participates the Canadian singer Buble, who in late March married in Buenos Aires to the Argentine model Louisiana Lopilato and who also knows the trick in scandals.
Recently, Buble called the American Kim Kardashian "sock" during one of his concerts in New York City
Japan recovered from earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ended the downturn that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that resulted in a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the Rising Sun Country has endured since World War II.
According to the Tokyo government’s initial estimates, the material losses amounted to $300,000 million – a blow that, despite the difficult world situation, seems to be going on.
After three losing quarters in a row, GDP data from July to September definitely helped turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in annual terms.
Recorded in the second quarter – for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 – also embodies the fastest growth rates from January to March 2010.
The revival can be partly explained by the revival of the purchase of machinery to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% against a 0.9% decline in capital expenditure that was seen from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real breakthrough in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse, which calls for using the crisis to strengthen – or restructure – infrastructure, using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, mainly due to the growth of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This figure increased by 1% under the influence of increased costs on cars, travel and leisure.
Claymo Yen
Tokyo has provided the domestic market, when the yen – the Japanese currency – became one of the “refugees” chosen by investors who want to get rid of the euro zone debt crisis and negative forecasts about the US, a privilege that presses, like a stone, on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for its low performance from July to September.
While the markets continue to siege the EU’s peripheral countries, the Yeshiko Noda government is not reducing vigilance.
We need to be alert to persistent risks such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, Economic Policy Minister Motohisa Furuqa said yesterday.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that most member countries showed clear signs of decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts turmoil in the global economy, has shown that the main forces are slowing down.
Then it fell by four tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average of 100 points after falling by eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again gives ground for doubts
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but the Conservatives would not sign any written commitment.
With peripheral premiums for risk and uncertainty prevailing in the parks, Greece continues to wander through a maze that leads to a way out of the big European debt crisis.
The feeling that the new transitional government’s “consent” is imposed rather by the demands of Brussels than by the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, warned yesterday that there are no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred-day period agreed upon during his appointment may be insufficient for their implementation, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonio Samaras, has assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and has reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled for February 19.
The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit, Papadimos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will be crowned tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new executive power.
The package of 24 programmes to increase the employment of the population, reforms of the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras’s message does not clear doubts about his position: “We are ready to help the transitional government, but we do not promise anything.”
The leader of the Conservatives has taken one step further in his feelings about the EU and the IMF, organizations that must unfreeze the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and explained that he will not give his approval to any letter of consent to the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still upset by the effect of Papandreou’s all-or-nothing referendum claims, repeated yesterday that its demands were unambiguous: it would not resume aid unless the new government and the leaders of Greece’s major parties signed “a written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible.”
A spokesman for the Ministry of Economy, Amadeus Altafaï, said the inspectors of the troika could "very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new government "what needs to be done to pay the sixth tranche" in the amount of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been specified.
There will be enough grass in the Greek cloth for a while.
Ms. Sofia: “These are instruments of progress and hope”
The Queen stressed Spain's "main" place in this type of finance
Spain “has taken a prominent place in the world in the field of microfinance.”
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades, the country has become the second largest donor of cooperation tools, whose “essence,” she said, lies in being “an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind, based on faith in the people.”
The Queen opened the fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that such actions are "absolutely necessary" to the UN Millennium Goals set by 2015 and "particularly aiming to halve the number of people living with less than one dollar a day - the level at which the "poverty line" is recorded."
Spain is “still working” to expand its network of recipients around the world and is taking on this task with all “responsibility,” says doña Sofia and hopes that the efforts and achievements made during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “assure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women, the “main recipients of these loans.”
There are “many achievements” and “many difficulties we face.”
The microcredit summit becomes not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that promotes “two main goals.”
Thus, Her Majesty explained that she hopes that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families will benefit from these financial services and a hundred million of these households will get out of the poverty they are immersed in.
The impetus to create a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world "goed the path started years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, Ms. Sophia emphasized as "an act of justice and recognition."
And she described the instrument’s father as a “surprising idealist in the general cause of poverty alleviation,” whose work has been known for 15 years, since the queen went to Bangladesh to study his credit policy on site.
This experience took over a year later at the first World Summit in Washington, D.C., and other meetings such as those held in Côte d’Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “I saw continuous development everywhere,” said Her Majesty, whose connection to this project brought her yesterday the title of “head of the family” gathered in Valladolid by the “banker of the poor.”
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded the speech by calling on the attendees to participate in the discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
The Ethical Imperative
Foreign Minister Trinidad Himenez said solidarity is an “ethical imperative” for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries with times of economic boom, as it is a “permanent commitment.”
Chimenees concluded that microcredit involves a “serious and firm course to eradicate poverty,” and now “more than ever” developed governments should work on solidarity criteria and not allow it to fall victim to spending cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of development cooperation.”
State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, praised the “success” in giving “confidence” to the people “who are obsessed, to whom all doors are closed,” and Mayor of Valladolid Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed all present in the city, which “opens its doors, enveloped by a spirit of solidarity.”
The CDU proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by universal vote
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Congress on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig went without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned in the program, but emerged in the autumn, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that the policy of the government is far from as strict as it should be today with regard to Greece and tomorrow with regard to Italy.
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, submitted for discussion by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The applause, which lasted for a few minutes, which earned her speeches by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, an europhile and finance minister, left no room for doubts.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct answer to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.”
For the Chancellor, “it’s time for a breakthrough in Europe.”
This could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty that make it possible for the European Union to strengthen control of the euro area’s financial policies, but it could also affect the election of the European Commission president by universal vote “to give Europe a face.”
In any case, this is one of the proposals for a draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which apparently belongs to Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree to this decision; Britain is against it, and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also against it.
Soil is prepared.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the vote of each member country in the European Central Bank’s board according to the size of each of their economies, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Wishing to calm the situation in her party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence Congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in a difficult position who like to criticize "high-profile" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devotes an entire paragraph to the importance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Only by way.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is Hospital Lists Fraud?
Following the monetary benefits, UMP and the government began an offensive on the hospital sheets.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefits Fund and deliver a speech on this issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on the fight against social benefits fraud.
And to help this offensive, arising from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also part of the right-wing re-election campaign, most want to concentrate on the hospital lists.
In the first place, in view of budget savings, the government intends to impose on employees of private companies a fourth day of unpaid leave before the start of the payment of benefits.
Obviously, without the special consent of the employer, a sick employee will lose a salary for four days equal to at least 15% of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to spark a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save €280 million.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely to impose on public servants one day without paying sickness benefits (public servants have so far not had to wait for the payment of benefits, unlike the three-day wait for private sector workers).
Now that these issues are being discussed, most are also again raising the topic of fraud, referring to abuse in the issue of medical records.
The controls will be tighter and, in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all the payments you received illegally,” Xavier Bertrand warned on RTL on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the application was somewhat disproportionate to actual abuse of hospital records.
Indeed, since 2002 they have been subjected to constant control and political attacks that are yielding fruit.
People in France are sick no more than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s first look at the numbers.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of Health Economics, the daily compensation expenses in 2008 amounted to €11.3 billion and amounted to 5% of the total healthcare expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% belonged to maternity leave and work-related accidents and 54% to sickness benefits, which amounted to 6.2 thousand euros.
And, therefore, amounted to 2.5% of health related expenses.
French people spent an average of 14.5 days in hospital in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
Average arithmetic, which hides some deviations; another study published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, found that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they did not take a single day of sickness.
Another study, this time on health insurance, claims that in 2010 37% of hospitalizations lasted less than 8 days, 15% lasted from 15 days to one month, 15% lasted from one to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
If you compare these figures with the figures of European neighbors, you can see that French workers are not more likely to take hospital pay than workers of any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001, the overall share of absence from work in France (for health reasons or not) ranged between 10% and 11%, compared to 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital lists is very low compared to “grey” employment.
The level of fraud is very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has resulted in systematic hospital checks lasting more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term disease conclusions were “unjustified” or too long, representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked medical records for more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were "inappropriate or unfounded", which is equal to 132,000.
Overall, it turns out that 169,000 cases were “unfounded” on several million workers who received hospital records.
Figures that show very few cases compared, for example, with the "grey" numbers of employment.
According to UMP MP Dominic Thian, the author of the June report on this issue, they amount to between 9 and 15 thousand million euros of missed budget revenues per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely higher than fraud losses.
Papadimos: Greece should follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement plan to save its economy.
This was stated on Monday in parliament by Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos, adding that the 100 days granted to his coalition government were not enough to fulfill this task.
"In order to the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program," the head of government said, making his first public statement, opening a debate on a vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 should be the “main task” of the new government, as the country’s presence in the eurozone “is at stake,” he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos forecasts a reduction in the country’s budget deficit “approximately to 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Opposition rejects new government measures
On Monday, right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support for measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with deputies from his New Democracy party.
He expressed his agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and fighting waste, but also his rejection of any course that impedes the economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner responsible for Economy and Finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 billion loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid, says the committee of experts
Canadians are denied death, says a report by the Royal Society of Canada
Regarding palliative medicine, the committee argues that the government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, and that does not include cases of cancer.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts from different fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee proposes that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow self-help and euthanasia when this choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, experts refer to a recent study by the Bureau of Economic Experts, which compared the quality of deaths in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that “medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death.”
Because of medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospitals.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and self-help suicide, the authors of the report come to a conclusion that contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and self-help suicide.
Now, according to experts, who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization entails abuse in application, i.e. the implementation of euthanasia or suicide with foreign aid against people who cannot or do not want to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Joselin Downey, who presented the report, confirmed during a teleconference that the majority of such cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide with help were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Self-assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Joselin Downey.
Canadians for euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians are in favor of euthanasia because, according to a 2010 survey by Angus Reid, they believe it will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not be a signal that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for people who assisted in suicide, 41% of respondents believe they should not be prosecuted.
As for extending or terminating medical care for the patient, the situation is less unambiguous, the authors of the report say.
They also suggest, in addition to their other recommendations, that the criminal code should establish that legally lawful termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also demands that healthcare professionals be trained in a spirit of respect to refuse medical care at the end of life without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls on the government, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee demands that it be used when it does not serve to silence physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same restrictions.
Observations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Metr Pierre Deschan, a specialist in healthcare legislation, described the position of the experts who signed the report as “extreme” because, among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia to fatalities.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says Meter Deshan, who yesterday discussed the summary of the report.
DeSham also stressed that the authors of the report seem to put the independence of the individual above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said that “there are warning signs and prohibitions in society.”
Margaret Somerville, a health law expert, also expressed her “catastrophic disagreement with the findings of the report, which she called a “manifest for euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, in particular, the report’s data on abuse in some countries where euthanasia and self-help are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan urges President Assad to surrender power
Damascus condemns “conspiracy”
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Bashar al-Assad supporters held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria has intensified by Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists him and condemns the “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership in the Arab League, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syria’s neighbors Turkey and Jordan called for President Assad’s resignation.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to yield to power in Syria, where about forty civilians and servicemen of the regime's armed forces were killed.
"If the interests of his country were dear to Bashar, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life," the king of Jordan, a neighboring country to Syria, told the BBC.
Turkey’s Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkey’s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, were unsuccessful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, hinting on Syria, a neighboring country against which Turkey takes an increasingly tough course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “expanding consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” that followed the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly harsh course of repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 representatives of the regime’s armed forces have been killed in the Deraa area in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) reports.
Two other residents were killed during a shooting and gunfire in Jabar in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that the country is approaching the end of the crisis.
He also reacted sharply to the Arab League’s decision to exclude Damascus, which he called a “dangerous step.”
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that this conspiracy against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the Arab League is currently studying “a mechanism for protecting civilians and demanding that 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers be brought into the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also called for the UN to send observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said had fallen into “paranoia.”
A new League emergency meeting is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on November 2 and which includes, in particular, the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities where fighting is going and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League decision "inappropriate", while China called on Syria to implement a plan to get out of the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
Italy’s future prime minister, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form their team and execute a program that would require “sacrifices” to restore creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi’s rule.
The former European Commissioner yesterday participated in a discussion with political parties ahead of today’s meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet composed of technocrats outside the parliament.
Monti spoke about the importance of a program involving many casualties, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the numerous small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions following a meeting with the prime minister candidate.
Deputy House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask parliament before Friday to vote on confidence to make sure the new government has sufficient support.
The meeting will end with Mr. Monti presenting a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of the country, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on yesterday’s nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders, asking for time.
“Democracy takes time to prepare the government and the program,” he said, adding that he is convinced that markets will be patient and understandable.
His appointment as president was initially approved by the markets, but concerns reappeared, after an unexpected drop in euro area industrial production in September.
The appointed prime minister was supposed to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians.”
The new government will have to act until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to Deputy Chamber Speaker Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive a vote of confidence in parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monti assured that, once he took office, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become an important player in Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: "Despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed."
The European Union, convinced that Rome will not meet its 2013 budget, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, has called for, among other things, tougher measures.
Italian “boss” Emma Marchagallia, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country that does not have growth can’t meet the deficit parameters.”
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as a European Commissioner (1994-2004), presents a “change of era” for Italy after 17 years of “berlusconism”, a “professor” symbolizing a “challenge of seriousness” and a “other Italy”, according to the authors of the front lines.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid early elections, as by April 2012 Italy must make payments on government debt in the amount of 200 thousand euros.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, a U.S. agency specializing in the field of nuclear danger confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other UN agency documents to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military aspect” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, which relies largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934 and worked for 30 years, “starting in the 1960s, at the Soviet military nuclear facility in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds with explosive methods.”
In 1989 or 1991 he left the center to create a company that produces "nano diamonds" in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his company led him to contact with the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then collaborated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its report, the IAEA mentions "evident signs that Iran's development of the "nuclear detonator system" was contributed by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technique well, but who also told the agency that he had worked most of his career on this technology as part of his home country's military nuclear program."
Anti-Muslim Crimes Increase by 50%
According to the FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence decreased slightly or remained unchanged over the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims grew from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is equivalent to an increase of 49%, compared with a 13% increase in cases of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in attacks on Jews and a 14% overall increase in the number of crimes on religious grounds.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47,3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% were religious differences.
Following a decline in 2009, there is concern that the number of these crimes is rising again, human rights organization Human Rights First stressed, “the increase in violence against Muslims is significant,” the organization added in an official statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be treated as serious human rights violations,” added one of the leaders of the organization, Paul Legander.
"The U.S. government can and should do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes."
“Hate-based crimes” in federal law are a legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This law was adopted after Martin Luther King’s death to punish acts of violence related to race, color, religion, nationality and today’s sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform and becoming similar to Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging site Twitter made changes to the presentation of its platform that will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they follow, which makes the service similar to Facebook.
The new “activity” tab and a different “name” tab make it easier and more direct to track the activity of other “Twitter” users, the Internet users whose messages (“tweets”) you are tracking, and those who are tracking yours.
This allows you to know if they will post messages, if they will sign up for new accounts, if they will have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being widely used across the network on Monday, Caroline Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which has long been known as intuitively rather unclear and as using rather vague terms (RT for posting someone else’s temptation, #followfriday for recommending to follow other users), mostly pleasing experienced users, opens itself thus to a wider audience, presenting users with something closer to the popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of "tweets" on the Internet.
“It’s useless, obsessive, and too much like Facebook.”
Functional activity will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter stream, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austrian
The introduction of the "golden rule" of the budget
The leadership of the large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write the budgetary "golden rule" into the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible reduction by rating agencies of Austria's state credit rating (a triple A).
Chancellor Werner Faymann personally announced this decision at the end of a meeting of the Council of Ministers, while Austria’s public debt is 74.6%, which is significantly higher than the upper threshold of the rate of 60%, set by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's solvency fell by only one point, from AAA to AAA+, we would have to pay interest by three thousand million euros more each year, said Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister from Christian Democrats Michael Spindlegger.
Thus, Austria is fulfilling the requirement of the Eurozone summit on October 26 in Brussels; heads of state and government have called for budget deficits to be cut by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced government accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The ruling, adopted by the Austrian government, resembles the “German model” as Germany was the first European country to adopt this “rule”.
By 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the state budget of the federal state in any year should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, and the lands, like communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to make public debt fall below the 60% mark stipulated by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Yeshiko Noda
threatens to interfere in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yeshiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would conduct new interventions in the foreign exchange market if the value of the yen continues to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the yen exchange rate, Mr. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to almost the historic mark that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which set a new record of strength since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown steadily, driven by purchases by investors who perceive it as a “refuge” in these blurred times of worldwide economic downturn and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the level that triggered the latest intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency damages Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the volume of income of Japanese firms from abroad when converting into the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), Noda stressed, fearing that this growth in the yen would kill the fragile germ of recovery.
The world’s third-largest economic power resumed growth in the third quarter by -1,5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to the growth of exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect the “fundamental economic indicators of Japan.”
Finance Minister Zhong Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened its two-day monetary policy council meeting on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But Deputy Managing Director Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken "appropriate steps" to make it clear that no further easing should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting in late October, the issuer increased the purchase of Treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (47,000 million euros), raising to 55,000,000 million yen (519,000 million euros) the ceiling of amounts it allocates to the purchase of various financial instruments to saturate the securities market.
The Eurozone
Rates are rising, stock markets are fluctuating
The risk of infection by the debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges went a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
At 10 a.m. in Paris, CAC 40 lost 1.4% and finished trading at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4 percent and London by 0.1 percent.
Due to new difficulties with the payment of loans by euro area countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
“Preoccupied investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo stock exchange closed down 0.7% amid new market participants' doubts about Europe's ability to withstand the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its gaze toward Europe, and the exchanges will follow in a narrow corridor of change until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsuzige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return of concerns about the future of the eurozone hits the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest point in one and a half months.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, falling by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it fell after the CDU congress of Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, in particular, the possibility for a country in a difficult position to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish interest rates significantly higher than 6%
Loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level that is very worrying.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while the yield of Spanish bonds with the same repayment period reached 6.2%.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel concerns among participants.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the stock exchanges to restore the situation in Italy, which is threatened by debt paralysis.
Greece’s new prime minister, Lucas Papadimos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 will be the “main task” of his government.
Spain was under fire on the markets ahead of Sunday’s parliamentary elections.
The spread between the interest rates on the 10-year debt obligations of Germany and Spain has reached a new historic high.
Expecting growth figures in the Eurozone
France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3%, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, despite this, revised the second quarter figure to a decrease, with a 0.1% drop in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Economists are worried about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded a 0.5% growth in the same period.
The first assessment for the eurozone as a whole is expected at 11 am, the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
The Energy Policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be decided after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that election meetings are an occasion to reflect on the share and place of nuclear energy.
The dispute will not be fruitful until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options have been examined.
France must build its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
We are now 7 billion people on the planet, and demographic developments will result in the need for electricity doubling by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world’s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing fossil deficit in order to continue producing electricity consistently, not forgetting the crucial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to tackle climate imbalance – a topic that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That’s why Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case for Belgium, which depends on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are just a few of those who are determined to continue their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one plant to its kit, resuming the construction of the station, which was interrupted after the accident on Three Mile Island.
Although Germany’s model based on renewable energy is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, aggravated by increased demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, and a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be noticeable.
We should take the example of Denmark.
The European champion in turbine construction, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, it is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; due to which carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the average in Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than the French households.
In a globalized economy, as the price of energy is a key competitive factor and the key to servicing industrial equipment on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Consequently, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will make beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power illusory.
The price most French refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the energy policy of the country has made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect.
Heavily export-oriented, it attracts a whole multitude of international trade-specialized small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France decided to abandon nuclear power, it would have to donate a large number of these enterprises and lose 6 billion euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrical engineer would order an EPR designed to work for sixty years if it was planned to shut down its manufacturer?
To solve the energy equation, it is necessary to acknowledge that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy production.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy,ining the highest level of safety is undoubtedly a vital issue.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control of existing energy centers such as Flamandville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is widely recognized, are full of the same obsession with safety.
Over the past 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major incidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any consequences for humans or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the device of the reactor and the unforgivable human error led to a tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the crash occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it has learned from the two previous ones.
The result of this step and the cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, presents a project to counter such phenomena.
Since it is considered by all energy professionals who want to build the reactor, stopping its construction in Flamandville will be a great gift to rivals Areva and EDF, paving the way for them to win leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and prejudice to prevail in a dispute that is so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a benefit to the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various sides – the overload of police, judicial and administrative services subordinated to the policy of numbers and the compatibility of this policy with France’s self-proclaimed status as a “state of human rights.”
Then there was an administrative harassment of foreign students, which came to the news when the Minister of the Interior ("Libération" of May 23) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, stoneworkers and waiters."
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The right and the left agree on this.
On the right-wing side, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 stated that “900,000 unemployed people will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers,” and on the left-wing side by Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990 that France “cannot accept the poor from all over the world.”
The difference is in generosity.
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the territory of the country by the Polish water pipeline horde was felt by both the left and the right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and French society.
The only difference is the level of generosity they will show to immigrants.
In his program, Francois Hollande limited himself to banality, saying that “joint work will solve our immigration problem.”
This view of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book summarizing the latest data on immigration (Special People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Determine Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Publishing House, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that host immigrants.
Restricting immigration leads to slowing growth and lowering employment.
Fears of the influence of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace local workers, especially low-skilled, provoking lower wages.
But experience shows that in reality, immigrants complement much more than replace local workforce by doing jobs that lack local workforce.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local workforce, and the most skilled are in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive impact on salaries
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between locals and immigrants leads to the fact that the arrival of immigrants positively affects the salaries of local workers.
Perry estimated that a 1% increase in immigration flows would result in a 0.6-0.9% increase in real long-term wages.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (among American Nobel laureates a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, while Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net income to social security systems, providing an average of 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, in Germany, an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will bring a net profit (income minus expenses) of an average of 150,000 euros to the state budget during his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy at the beginning of his term of office was going to "tooth" to get stuck in the missing points of growth.
The mentioned teeth, which were used to scare away immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to understand European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but at the same time fragile.
The European continent must remember that, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the twentieth century it survived the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some believed that in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it was enough to organize a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since the time of Napoleon the "Little", it is known that it comes from the superficiality of thinking.
Whilst universal voting is a prerequisite for democracy, it is not a sufficient prerequisite for democracy and may even become a “instrument of suppression,” as Republican philosopher Ethan Wasro said.
No, democracy requires much more – public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palynody of a true-false Greek referendum will have a double exposing effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious change of policy and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality must be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the frontline of the struggle for democracy has now shifted and, according to many, Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We won’t win anything by demanding a series of national referendums, organized as necessary and in a chaotic order.
A "card-blank" for an absolute European monarch or a jump with the legs bound into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we are not dreaming of a guillotine blade, but of the implementation – jointly, clearly and continuously – of choice and democracy, this time at a pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many of them will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis – the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is subjected to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but Europe as a whole is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is urgent to restore the management of the European project to the sovereignty of the people.
Because only by working together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of everyone’s debt, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
To get out of the crisis will require decisions at a pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without leading us to a catastrophe.
After a long discussion of this proposal, the Socialists and Jacques Delors are now all demanding a European economic government.
Let it so.
But to imagine it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has come into existence is another madness and a new impasse.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to “create” Republicans.
The revolution of interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains in force.
We must build a united Europe on an economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a real European people’s sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are becoming increasingly widespread.
The world exhibition of chip cards opens on Tuesday in Wilpent near Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors (banking cards, phones with SIM-cards), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6 thousand million units.
The most important is the contactless technology sector, which allows you to pay for public transportation or purchases simply by holding a map over a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier.
Their share will grow in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and will account for 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature, and they are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France starts from a more modest position: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are in circulation.
But the big shops are boosting the pace.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass.
To move to a higher speed, it is necessary for banks to supply their customers with equipment.
“Two major organizations in France have pledged to systematically distribute bank cards adapted for contactless use among their customers in the future,” said Gerard Neboui, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments using mobile phones.
But this is only the first stage in the development of the future means of payment, that is, the mobile phone.
So far, only a few devices are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary for such transactions.
“They were postponed.
“But they should really fly out next year.”
“We expect global sales to range from 80 to 120 million units in 2012,” explains Mark Burten, head of Eurosmart.
Banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced the conduct of the experiment from December to June next year in Cannes.
Approximately 200 customers and employees will be equipped with iPhone devices that provide contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to launch a market offer that allows its customers to pay through mobile phones.
Terrorist Front Spreads From Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about Islamic Maghreb’s ties to Boko Haram.
Long-presumed links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sector have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that Algerians are now confident.
"The way these two organizations are using and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating," he explained, without going into details.
Paris appears to have come to similar conclusions.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French men in Niger in January revealed two linkages.
Abducted in a Niamey restaurant by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leocour and Vincent Delori were apparently killed the next day along with several of the abductors during an operation conducted by French special forces.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone SIM cards belonging to terrorists.
This is terror
The analysis of the calls indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maidiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other - a person allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a step forward, but we must undoubtedly wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
“But it is possible.”
"It has been known for many years that the sect is receiving financial and ideological support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more active," says Kunle Amouvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of lethal bombs and increasingly sophisticated explosives of the same type that Aqmi uses.
The international community led by Washington is now putting pressure on Abu Dhabi to bring attention to the problems that Boko Haram creates.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally regarded this group as an uninteresting community of enlightened people.
Rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri at a mosque, school, and the imam-fundamentalist Muhammad Yusuf, Boko Haram – which means “Western education is sinful” – preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization achieved rapid success.
It is politized and demands strict observance of Sharia, and its activists have begun a struggle against the evil central government.
It is mainly targeted at churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were active, carrying out numerous attacks on police offices.
Abuji’s reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and will go beyond its northern votices.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for the rally that killed 80 people in Jos, and then another one in Abu Dhabi.
In June in Abu Dhabi, Boko Haram organized the first suicide attack on a fortified police headquarters.
In August, the United Nations local representation will be their first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, now concerns all security experts.
Today, with Aqmi establishing itself in Mali and Niger, and the Somali al-Shabaab operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Goodlak Jonathan Alain Juppé warned about the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his readiness to share all available information.
The world as Republican presidential candidates see it
With regard to China, Iran, and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, lead a complex world with simple, or rather simplified ideas?
If you listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe it.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have multiplied loud but detailed foreign policy statements that have traditionally been the strong side of the Republicans.
Slogans about China, Iran, and aid to Israel are often confused.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chances of being nominated from the "Old Good Party", threatened to file a complaint against the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of "manipulating their currency - this is a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the migration of entire industries into Asia.
Even worse if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate who is familiar with complicated foreign policy, has failed to overcome a stance that is overwhelming.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who holds at the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard of.
The Reagan Style
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions do not stop its nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb.”
He also vowed to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfill his promises to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, second in the ranking of candidates, demonstrated disappointing ignorance.
He recently called for resistance to China’s military threat because Beijing is trying to nuclear power – obviously not knowing that China has had it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes on Iran, says he is ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The torture of terror suspects, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Kane, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman.
All this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight of foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president respond that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to lower his tone in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of the "children" from Iraq, his tricks in Libya, which brought him the reputation of a weak politician.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers a positive balance of national security under Obama, which liquidated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that will be bound in the sand.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
North Stream, a new gateway for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, connecting Western Europe and Russia directly along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has been launched.
It is designed to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between the orchestra’s performance and exquisite snacks, in the opening of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mart Rutte together turned a symbolic valve controlling the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
Through the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic meters of gas will be supplied to Western Europe each year via the first pipeline of 1,224 km, connecting the Leningrad region with the land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline is expected to be completed by the end of 2012, providing a total supply of 55 thousand million cubic meters of gas, equivalent to the total consumption of France.
The possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic states.
Nord Stream will actually allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding the passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their power: it will be harder for them to influence Russia, threatening to shut down access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop comparing the Nord Stream with the new "German-Soviet Pact", hinting on an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This is a politically sensitive issue.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of its supplies.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to its understanding of a direct alliance between Russia and wealthy Western countries, which consume large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are already running out.
“This pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it’s a new artery that organically connects us,” said Fillon, opening the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the Gazprom heads who were present in large numbers at Lubmin, the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The submarine pipeline is made of steel enclosed in concrete to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to bypass the mine fields that remained from the Second World War.
“One hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
There were also many steps needed to protect fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake weighing as much as 242 Eiffel Towers, without breaks throughout its length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers rejected it because Sweden was not delighted that the Russian state company would permanently settle off its shores.
"In the event of an accident, we will cut off the flow of gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
So, in case of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline will go into the air.
But this seems unlikely to the designers who designed seams designed to run only once every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline will be carried out by a submarine robot, which pulls the ship, for external observation, as well as an apparatus circulating inside the pipeline.
The cigar-like apparatus is inserted into the pipeline with a diameter of 1 meter and is pushed forward by the flow of gas.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it gives accurate information about any metal deformation.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the need for the slightest repair.
The circulation of gas is carried out only by its pressure.
It is 200 bar at departure and 100 bar at arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15,5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which was commissioned to build and operate the pipeline.
Its headquarters is in Tsuga, Switzerland, where taxation is favorable.
Gazprom then leased the company for 20 years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
“Gazprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of how much gas will actually be transported,” says Jens Müller.
The construction of the gas pipeline was financed by 30% shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works will be 7.4 thousand euros for two pipelines.
GDF Suez will invest around 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will pay off their costs, because Gazprom takes on all the risks.
The gas pipeline leads from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin to a sandy shore planted with needles.
Valves of 4.5 meters of height form the exit terminal of gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour, and 6 million in 2012.
The Moleskine Brand Notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company fifteen years ago, will return the taste of writing.
He has the smell of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easy to recognize by the rectangular black cover, by rubber, by yellow-white pages, as if yellowed with time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, has decided to launch the sale of design notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, took over the responsibility for the launch of the new product.
The note is inspired by the old manufacturing technique, moleskin - a lacquered cotton fabric used, for example, to cover benches.
It is claimed that this type of notepad is highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine brought into line with today’s taste an old and forgotten thing that was a cult for avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success has arrived.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales grew by 25% to 12.7 million units.
We are far from the production of the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Establishing a profile of a typical buyer is difficult, because the notebook attracts an entrepreneur, a student and a freelancer equally.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, broad-minded and educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notes in Fnac bookstores, stores in the centers of small cities and has been able to gain widespread fame.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new need for writing, despite the emergence of email," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This distinctive cultural trait accompanies the development of Moleskine; recently the brand organized the “Road around” exhibition, where architects and artists demonstrated their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched coverings with a leopard drawing on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags.
A success that gave rise to envy: In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which inscribed a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for disabled people begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is still twice the average, namely 19% versus 9% for the general population.
It disappointed?
“No,” emphasizes Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes the Disability Employment Week.
“In 15 years, significant progress has been made.”
At that time, the proportion of unemployed was not two, but three times more.
“But there is still a lot of work ahead.”
There are still many obstacles to disability in employment.
Among them are older people: 37% older than 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a rather low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85% for disabled people versus 38% on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and that are the core of the problem,” said Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about a mentality that is changing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association on behalf of Cité found that the managers surveyed had a low level of knowledge about disability and “imagined people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally handicapped.”
The result – private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of having 6% of disabled workers set in the law adopted in 1987.
The latest known figures from 2008 are 2.6%.
“Today we’re about 3%,” said Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that don’t comply with the law.
Evidence: The number of "taxable" entities, as well as the amounts paid, decreased in 2007-2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 entities (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law that raised the tax has put a lot of pressure on companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects an increase in awareness, in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of organizations with employees between 20 and 49 have disabled workers versus 82% of organizations with employees between 100 and 199.
Azar: “What a happiness”
Before fighting the Blue on Tuesday evening at 20.45, Eden Azar and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they received from this friendly match.
We will not get to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to the tribune of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months later, after his offensive in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
“I’m very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he’s a Belgian.”
“I want to go further,” assures player Lily.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the national team, it is one whole, he justifies.
“I’m in Lille all year round, but I’m not in Belgium.”
“I have to make glasses.”
Left in stock on the eve of this match against France, in a game against Romania on Friday evening, Azar came to Saint-Denis to finally "shine."
Not to forget, however, the concept of “pleasure.”
He has supported the Blue since the age of 7 and won campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I have always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also reinforces the character of this match.
And especially that on the other side are Matei (Debushy), Yohan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami),” he recalls.
“Our roads just crossed.”
"To have the opportunity to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens gently recalled the “pride.”
It’s a pride to play a “Fest match.”
"Pride" also claimed as a "neighbor" that France "re-established a very high-level team" just a year after the injury in Nizhny Novgorod.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderstorm, he admired.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, the technical athlete will fly in the same plane with the blue... to Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing up,” he said.
“We are building something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry.”
“You’ll see this in future matches, including this against France.”
Portugal is very confident.
Portugal’s Paulo Bento starts his match against Bosnia (22.00 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt that the team, which he has been driving since September 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a match to play and Bosnia to win.
Given 0-0 on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to reach the goal that would calm her.
"This is a good result, which, however, involves a certain risk."
But at home, at their brightly illuminated de la Luz stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in the sight of the audience, which should be enthusiastic, although the match will be very tense," Bento said.
“We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” said the successor of Carlos Caio.
On Friday in the match against Bosnia demands the Portuguese victory.
Nobody could have arranged the Bosnians.
“It’s a good result, but there’s some risk,” Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team that has many technical merits and players who have many individual merits," he added.
As it was already in Zenice, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "not giving them time to reflect."
It was a good idea, but this time it was realistic.
