This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but also provides details fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top with pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other features of feathers, such as barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display.
The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not a chick's down.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, and place a pre-printed sheet of paper with their choice of candidate into an envelop.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelop into the ballot box and sign the voting roll.

Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

The eathquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said no damage was reported in the country.
Also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there was no Tsunami indication.
A former Filipino policeman has kept Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Various prisoners have been rescued and least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an old woman as she needed the lavatory. Mendoza was killed.
Liggins followed his father’s footsteps and entered a medical career.
The graduate was an obstetrician and started working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began to investigate premature labor during his spare time.
The research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would speed up the foetal lung development.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as freaky as me...maybe even more...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place."
In 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed in the campaign of the 2010 federal election that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 per cent of those in the poll agree with this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 per cent of those surveyed believe Australia should be a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe Australia should never be a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his fitness has been in doubt.
The drugs he needed to overcome his pain are banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
The discovery was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to the earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship in early year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
The rumors were referred to as "political chatter and silliness".
The candidate is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport is being put on and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park and ride facilities are available at the ground.
Fears of lack of transport raise the possibility that the game would be forced to play behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
The study published on Thursday in Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Scientists from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported the new species developed in two generations, but this process took much longer due to breeding between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into thin wire, which can be twisted and plaited. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and stuck on other metal. It can be made so thin that it was used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basis (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is defined by the amount of Hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have their electrons stripped off them (since Hydrogen atoms are made of one proton and one electron).
Brush the dry powder together and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outside layer, which will feel funny and form a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in most homes, attached to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space gets the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth’s atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is giving us much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other transport devices.
Under them are more medium sized cats that eat medium sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat the far more numerous small prey like insects, rodents, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special job each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides are made up of one to three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The males are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances and pull with five times the force of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full voice of a lion, but more like a sentence of snarly, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes and rodents if they can. Most of the animals that the ocelot hunts are far smaller than it is.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing for where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move very stealthily.
When a small group of living things (a small population) gets separated from the main population they came from (like if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily move back) they often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what they had before.
The original population has not changed much, they still need the same adaptations as before.
The new population gradually adapts to their new environment, and starts to look less and less like other populations.
The two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
These are called speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen which humans breathe, and they take in carbon-dioxide which humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
plants make food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
They make our homes from plants and make clothing from plants.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws were covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning no escape for any thing that crossed its path.
The species may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, and may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that enters the water, even a giant dinosaur such as T. rex would not be matched.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
The other difference was that while poor people and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they would lounge on their sides while they ate their food.
Ancient Roman meals could not include food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
Examples are corn, tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the home of the god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to attend to the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Occasionally special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In warm Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family occurred in open air.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open counters looking into the street. Stone was used for building homes.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled sparsely. In the Norse sagas Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when traveling further west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Though each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you may think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence was the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text is on the bottom of the document, upside down.
The large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
It is likely that the notation was added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the following battles had freed the north of France, but the south still was not free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
Civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization is a Latin word related to the Latin civil, meaning civil, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and that also defines the size of the society.
Cities are the precursors to nations. A civilisational culture requires the passing of knowledge across several generation, a lingering cultural footprint and fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often fade without leaving relevant historic evidence and fail to be recognised as proper civilisations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government with the Congress as its only component.
Because there was no national executive or judiciary, Congress relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its acts.
It also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between States.
The Articles required a joint consent from all the States before they could be changed and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives often absent.
Italy's national football, along with German national football team is the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the biggest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
The cluster/group of islands Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an “archipelago”
Taiwan beginnings start in the 15th century when European sailors passing by record the island as Formosa Island or beautiful island.
In 1624,Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces take control of Taiwan’s western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan as a Qing province in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Shimonoseki Treaty, which gives Taiwan to Japan, which rules the island until 1945.
Intihuatana, the Sun Temple, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better picture of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu was restored and restoration continues to today.
The most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm in width by 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The much-used and often-riddled rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while keeping a measure of order in an image.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
The Christian religion has bound European states together despite languages and customs.
It all-over-spreading power affected everyone from king to commoner.
The main Christian principles are that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church monetary resources are there specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this tenet was being met.
After the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy was effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, but it violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations took attitudes of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to prevent such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
The US arrived with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinctive dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between Han and Jin Dynasty.
During these periods fierce fighting occurred between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the most bloodiest eras in Ancient China’s history, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace at Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people not to one sole ruler.
After the Revolution occupations were open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
Similarly, the military has changed its rankings to based on class.
The French Revolution also inspirated many other repressed working class people of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammad was very interested in matters outside of this mundane life. He often visited a cave called “Hira’” on the Mountain of “Noor” (light).
The remaining cave, which survived the times, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountain ranges north of Mecca, and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
The cave is not easy to find even if one knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it is totally isolation.
Nothing can be seen other than the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.
The Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egyptian Valley of the Dead is a complex of pyramids, several small tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The up bow mark looks like a V and the down bow mark like a slant or a square missing its top side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
Up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is more aggressive and more aggressive.
Feel free to pencil in your own marks, but remember the printed bowing marks are there for musical reasons, so they should usually be respected.
The threatened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on 6th October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a mob of people screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The mob of people forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows.
The mob waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the Queen.
The war expenditures of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people.
The Philippines took up a major duty to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to defray major expenditures and interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
The superprofits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand Templars one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The time when the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The high Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a core logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely without cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on society that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
Examples are vehicles that essentially lead to road development.
However, a nationwide road network is not economical for just a handful of cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to higher incidence of accidents on the road, leading to the development of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography molded individuals, and over time customs and culture related to that geography developed, and these, being in harmony with the place of the society, were better than arbitrary laws.
In the same way as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
The reputation for being an epicenter of luxury started in about 400 A.D. and lasted up to about 1100 A.D.
The status of the city declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the return of Crusaders with gifts such as silks and spices that were more expensive than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channel, West could become behind by 25–30 years.
The end of the Middle Ages western Europe began to develop their own style.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved seed native to the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive because of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Member groups often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and argot.
The most common method to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune or wilful abuse, not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined to people (usually their own parents); in some cases this child abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairment.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are alleged to have been brought up by animals; some have lived in the wild on their own.
When completely brought up by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely like those of the care-animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes beyond.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffoldings can be both virtual and real, e.g. a teacher is a form of scaffolding but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffoldings are internalized in the software and are designed to question, prompt, and explain procedures that may be difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide range of reasons, ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever grow in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
The Foster Care System is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home they previously took from.
The Internet combines mass and interpersonal communication elements.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimension in terms of the use and gratification approach.
Examples of such motivations include learning and socialization (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement” and “continuing relationships” were also identified as new motivational aspects in Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is believed that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, pointed to how people who do not understand speech because of brain damage can still assess sincerity accurately.
The researcher also suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
The 20th century research has revealed that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy its amino-acid requirements from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for humans to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide high quantity proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in almost the same way that chimps on the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is a process of purposefully awakening during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10–60 minutes).
This can be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully awakening you.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking lots of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, which causes one to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates oppositely to the amount of strain in one’s body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present.
All people can achieve enlightenment. The only thing preventing this goal is our own tension and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha but was extended by the Mahayana path of love and by many Indian Yoga techniques.
In principle Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (enlightening energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The centre of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities the energy channel is cleaned, the chakras are activated and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Since World War 2 Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, leading to cooperation between the USSR and USA. After the war the system, process and culture clash led to the country falling out.
With two years of the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for 40 years and would be fought for real, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete nearly overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Union Red Army invaded the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the Eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
using ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to transport large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The role of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while simultaneously interfering with your enemies' ability to move his people and goods.
The most recent example of this is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, when the Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
The German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany probably would have been able to conquer Britain as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats are thought to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were generally held in herds that walked on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways were simply parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses to achieve greater speeds and carry larger loads than on the slightly more rough roads of the day.
Early crossties were introduced to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, it was realized that tracks would be more efficient if they had a stip of iron on the top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheel of the wagons.
Eventually wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, full-iron railings were introduced.
The first known transport was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more friendly to the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists in order to reduce future suffering.
This is almost like symptomatic treatment in many cases.
It is clear that the world has changed much through human scientific and technological advances, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and mankind's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the printer shop of John Dunlap.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think about them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two back legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information which is coded in binary numbers.
Binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general that immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best evidence of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from ancient familiarity with Bed-bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are nidicolous, adapting to living in nest or housing of their host.
The United States has approximately 400,000 known cases of MS, which remains the most common neurological disease in younger and middle aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve.
Research has found that women are two times more likely to have MS than males.
A couple may decide it is not in their best interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoptive, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple may parent the child.
Science’ main goal is to figure out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually the basis for most scientific research.
It is not alone, experimentation and an experiment are testing that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focusing on classical texts, particularly on the Bible in Latin.
Accepted were Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Bio-clocks are self-sustaining oscillators which will continue to continue a period of free-running cycling even without external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
The two experiments involved marking the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Genetic mutations have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
Examples include visiting, photographing, learning about organgatuangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go to their work and are followed by others whose work destination is the same place they have left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone is somehow connected with, and supporting, a private transport system based on private cars.
The evidence now shows that this massive carbon economy has dislodged the biosphere from one of its most stable states that has supported human evolution for two million years.
All people participate in society and use transportation systems. Most people complain about transportation systems.
In developed countries you seldom hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges falling down.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers just incompetent?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with one another.
However, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one-hundred percent certainty.
However, drivers tend to be consistently acting, thus traffic streams tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: flow, density, and velocity.
This relationship helps in planning, design, and operation of roadways.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and friends more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Since thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus told that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems sensible, because the Earth does not feel as if it is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the biggest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second biggest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
The full 20 percent of water that goes out of the planet's rivers into the oceans is from Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building in stone continued throughout the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza never stood up in size and technical excellence in their construction.
New Kingdom ancient Egyptians marvelled at their predecessors monuments, which were then well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City's population is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Ancient people have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as they are all found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, believed that everything is made up of one or more of four elements, which were earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also believed that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
All matter is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
However, as newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to less status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, without having to touch a sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to build a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus up again then release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break apart with little or no evidence.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thicker under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thicker. It was easier for lava to rise up to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what attracts people or appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature to adulthood.
This theory focuses on what is about certain people that make them want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
The two spectrums of behavior can emerge as managers begin to lead former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain “one of the guys” (or gals).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary action, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
Otherwise, one morphs into an unrecognizable individual that feels he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
The team often has more autonomy than conventional team members as they may meet in varying time zones which may not be understood by the local management.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the management team to which each member report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time consuming process of establishing a learning organization?
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can appear.
The process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, sharing knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition investigation. Therefore it narrows the research area and makes it much more exact.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
The fact that different brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behaviour and some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaption in a machine.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, handwriting recognition, voice and face.
This has become a distinct discipline, focusing on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as has been built in several home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a large part of any classroom.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
Each year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, each year the website is updated, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blog posts can also help improve student writing.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve writing to prevent criticism.
Also blogging "forces students to become more savvy about the world around them." The need to feed the interest of the audience inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning well beyond the traditional school day.
Effective use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position in context of others' writings as well outline their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bi-lingual capital and features a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
North is Niagara Falls and north is home to the unexplored natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these and more highlight Ontario as quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are nearly uninhabited wilderness.
The most interesting comparison of population is that more African Americans live in the US than there are Canadian citizens.
East African Islands are in Indian Ocean off the southern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the biggest, and a continent on its own for wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it took a large part in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism started in the 15th century, when Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north the region is bound by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that women traveling indicate that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is helpful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences may result in harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, struck by the arm, etc.
Always be firm in turning down men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it does not make it OK).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina you can find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of geeks.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which destroyed most of the town’s streets, particularly the town centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base to climb the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma is normally around 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibleness, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished town, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the World Heritage List in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of Africa.
The city is stark contrast to the rest of the country, because it has more of an Arabic flair than of an African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa’s main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, daily conservation and entry fees are available for the park.
The Wild Card is also available, which provides access to either selection of parks in South Africa or all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider as the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make Hong Kong skyline has been ascribed to a glittering bar chart that is visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, head for the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
The great majority of Hong Kong Island’s urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the place the British colonists took as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is the place to start.
Sundarbans are the largest littoral mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps, but they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is water/marsh areas.
Since 1966 Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
BUSes depart the interdistrict bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading to the east and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to book a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and it has two lanes of 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction started in August 2011, and it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practised subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, surviving by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly called The Giant Province of the Indies, was born as a result of the Spanish conquerors' clash with the native indigenous groups.
Spaniards started the colonization period which lasted for three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to keep a lot of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year is in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches check Argentina Polo Association.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is set to be one British pound (GBP).
The only bank in the Islands is Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the island and within Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also accepted.
On outlying islands credit cards will likely not be accepted, but British and United States currency may be taken; check with the owner in advance to determine what is an accepted payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside of the island, so exchange money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in subtropics, with summer months temperatures above 30°C.
The winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons, and the amount of rain stays the same throughout the year.
Though many of the animals in the park are used to see humans, the wildlife is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bison, elk, moose, bears and nearly all large animals can attack.
The animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that odor attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous food and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is on the island of Upolu and has a population of under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All the ships were sunk, except one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the Mau movement’s independence struggle, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the death of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's straddling of two harbour. The most popular are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in north to Devonport in south.
The most sandy beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
This is a sometimes crowded family beach with good range of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer but refreshing and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to be had, but New Zealand and Australia wines might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are fearful.
Australians are foreign to the idea of 'flat white' coffee. A short black is called 'espresso', cappuccino is heaped high with cream (not froth), and tea is served with milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but good.
Many trips to the reef are made all year around, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Still, take advice from authorities, follow all signs, and closely watch safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur on beaches and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally they may be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but rarely attack humans.
Saltwater Crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat is in river estuaries north from Rockhampton.
Booking early gives the traveller confidence that they will have somewhere to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, but you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agent usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or procure other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendments or requests should be coursed through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
The majority of the attendants to music festivals choose to camp on site, and most attendants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you will have to get in early to get a camping site close to the action.
Remember that even though music on main stage may have finished, there may be sections of the festival that will keep playing music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for young children.
If crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as ice causes quite harsh noise for most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in town. Cruise passengers are exempted from visa requirements (check the terms).

They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep guests in good mood and keep them at the premises.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages on the house, but drunkenness hinders judgement, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Everyone who is going to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roadways, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow to get you stuck can fall in very little time.
visibility may also be restricted by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
In contrast, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic goes on mostly uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are probably the most important tourist draw in Africa and are a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to overland travel to view the stunning African wildlife, particularly on savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach closely to cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
Walking safari (also called a bush walk, hiking safari, or going footing) is a combination of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a difficult situation.
Cancellation policy varys, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were planned.
The most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Cleaning damp clothing can help them dry.
If an iron is not available or if you do not like ironed socks, try using a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to allow fabric to get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases, scorch).
There are different ways of purifying water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for a minute is enough, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and should you have concerns, then you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests that they do not know in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, irritate, or in worst case spread venom or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can either kill or kill people by force, do not usually qualify as pests.
Cheap shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempted from tax and excise at certain locations.
Travellers traveling to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated backwoods.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: steep grades, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are usually present.
Posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections, commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h). strict obedience to them is even more important than otherwise.
The phone service is much stronger here than on many other stretches of the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are good, and in Bavaria are quite rich and varied, similar to those of Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples cooked into pastries year round, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want some small but rich pastries try Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With over 7,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term for a wide range of regional cuisines found across the country.
If used without further qualifiers, the term tends to mean food originating from the central and southern parts of the main island Java.
Currently widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features an array of simply seasoned dishes, with the main flavorings being peanuts, chillies, sugar and aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can have safety concerns due to the potential for a rider's foot to get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of granite big walls and crags.
Summits are breathtaking views from peaks. Climbers from all parts of the world are continuously building new routes among its endless potential.
Downhill snowsports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," planning entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old, and cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport goes back to at least 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called backcountry ski, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is often related to but rarely involving alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter ones done in steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Skiing route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions you will be able to cover some distances than walking – but only rarely you will get the speeds of cross country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a small continent with many independent countries. In normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would require a huge number of applications and passport control.
The Schengen zone, however, works like one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross border without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa you do not need to apply for visas to any of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
The definition of antiques is not universal. Some tax agencies define older than 100 years old goods as antiques.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products may be defined as antiques, though they are younger than mass-produced products.
Rabbit husbandry is an important lifelong activity among the Sámi and the culture around the trade is important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi have been involved in large scale reindeer husbandry, but mostly lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern trades. Tourism is a major income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Though it is widely used, especially among non-Romani, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people.
If you are visiting a country under a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to consult the advice of other governments, but they are designed for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations from Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are merely a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The views presented are often cursory, general and oversimplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as they may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should get professional training.
A search on the Internet for 'Hostile environment course' will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in far more detail, usually with practical experience.
The course normally lasts for 2-5 days and will include role play, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapon training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications about war zones are few.
Voyagers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with no name and gender (X) or documents updated to match a desired name and gender varies.
Foreign governments’ willingness to honor these documents is also widely variable.
Security checkpoints have also become far more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Preoperative transgender people should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the return flow from waves breaking off the beach, often at a reef or similar place.
The return flow is concentrated at a few deeper sections, and a fast current to deep water may form.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
After you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normally.
Try aiming somewhere you are not caught again or, depending on your skills and on whether you have been noticed, you may want to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs sooner than culture shock (less honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who had easy time adapting to the new culture sometimes have particularly difficult time readjusting to their native culture.
When returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your traditional values from your home culture.
If you first travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that new travellers need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travellers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
The pyramids are dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
The story of sound and light is like a story book.
The Sphinx is set as the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit up.
South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the Peninsula, with the largest island of King George with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Peninsula, bound by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge into the plateau, then remerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phone is not generally a replacement for a mobile phone as you have to be outdoors with clear line of view to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions with remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give more information about connecting to this service.
The most popular option for gap-year planning is travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year out before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling on a gap-year course abroad can actually improve your chances of moving into higher education back in your home country.
Typically there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
The land of a thousand lakes has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes you do not need a yacht.
The coastal archipelagos and the biggest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, but smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat to every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g. in Netherlands the figure is one to forty).
Most of the distinct Baltic Cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the city for two full days while returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore using shipboard excursions you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany in brochures. As you can see from the map above Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying by plane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is not different from the personal fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
Understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight may help to overcome a fear based on the unknown or on not being in control.
Courier companies are well paid for quick delivery. Occasionally, time is very important with business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller firms there was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, on some routes it may take days to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations will not allow them to send luggage with no passengers, which is where you get in.
The most obvious way of flying in first or business class is to spend a thick wad of money for the privilege (or better, get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as rough rules, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business, and ten times for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in even looking for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airways know well that there are a core group of flyers who are willing to pay top dollar for a quick and comfortable ride, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romania, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic with ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member country.
Economic links have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with around 3.7 million people, the second biggest port after Istanbul, and a good transport hub.

There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who have loved ones who died or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti into structure.

Most monasteries provide wraps for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same line, men are required to wear trousers covering the knees.
This can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but that clothing is not washed after every user so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
The most common dinner, especially during summer, is the Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato and any available condiments such as cheese, tunafish, etc.
All nouns, alongside the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.

Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today, and remain as museums, or education sites.
As light pollution in the heyday was not the kind of problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or at campuses, easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the choice flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the Emperor for himself and other members of the imperial aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
plants look best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even one specimen.
If visiting a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" is also going to get you ejected, without discussion.
