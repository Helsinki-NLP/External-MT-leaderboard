The black box in your car?
While the American road planners are struggling with the lack of funding to fix the crumbling highway system, many are looking for a solution in the little black box that fits neatly on your car's dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile driven by a motorist and transmits that information to authorities, has become the subject of a controversial effort by Washington and the state planning office to revive the outdated system to fund major roads in the U. S. these days.
Even the usual tedium of highway planning has suddenly become a matter of intense debate and lively alliances.
Liberace environmental groups have joined forces to mobilize support for allowing the government to use these black boxes to keep track of the miles you've driven, and possibly the places you've driven - and then use this information to prepare tax bills.
The tea party is crazy.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned, raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether to take further action, many states are not waiting.
They're exploring how, in the next decade, they can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile they drive on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for test drives, some of which have GPS monitoring.
It is a real necessity for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether we choose or not", says Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which plans to start tracking every mile driven by motorists in California by 2025.
The way we pay taxes is going to change.
There is technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by the payment of taxes by American citizens on gas pumps, has almost gone bankrupt.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Now the car goes more miles on a gallon of gas than before.
The federal tax has not been raised in the last 20 years, at 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high price of gas, politicians avoid raising taxes by a penny.
"The gas tax is not sustainable at all", says Lee Munich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
The state recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test their per-mile payment system.
"In the long run, this will serve as the most rational option", he says.
Wonka calls it a mileage-based user fee.
Not surprisingly, this idea is appealing to urban liberals, because it could lead to changes in taxes to, for example, change the way cars drive, which could help reduce congestion and reduce greenhouse gases.
California planners are eager for this system as they develop strategies to meet the goals set out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But Rep. Bill Schuster (R-PA), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also considers the black box the most viable long - term option.
The independent sellers in the Region Foundation are also in favour of the payment per mile by the driver.
Adrian Moore, vice president of policy in the region, said, "This is not just a tax going into the blind well".
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been endorsed by two former US transport secretaries who graciously urged Congress to move towards pay-per-mile in their 2011 report.
The U.S. Senate last year approved a $90 million pilot project that involved 10,000 cars.
But acting on the concerns of rural legislators, who were representing individuals who had to walk many miles to work or to town every day, the House leadership dropped the motion on the spot.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most interested is Oregon, which has enrolled 5,000 drivers in the nation's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the state mileage charge instead of the gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the initial testing.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
and the I - 95 Alliance, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not find support everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was recently installed on the cars of 50 volunteer drivers, drivers were impatient to think that the government could monitor their every move.
"The big problem was concern about Big Brother and other things like that", says Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and operational management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
This is not something that people wanted.
As the trial progressed, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It will be fairly easy to convert these devices into full tracking devices".
There is no need to develop a vast, unmanageable technology infrastructure which must necessarily be spread to keep track of the daily movements of each person.
Nevada is one of many states that are doing everything possible to get affordable technology that allows the state to get details of how many miles a car is driving per day, but not where and at what time it is driving.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.
The firm was not originally in the business of assisting the state tax drivers.
It was attempting to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers were paid based on their mileage.
But the device it is testing is well liked by highway planners because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modems at fixed intervals.
"If you don't track people's speed and their location, they're more likely to adopt this method", said Ryan Morrison, chief administrator of True Mileage.
There are some big mistakes in these early programmes of the state.
There are also very low-cost and low-intervention ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can choose not to take any device but instead pay a fixed fee based on the average mileage travelled by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that the device can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience rather than less.
In New York City, transportation officials are trying to develop a taxing device that would include parking meter fees, provide "pay as you drive" insurance, and create a collection of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.
The city planning document notes that "motorists will be attracted to participate because of the benefits they will derive from it".
However, some transport planners wonder that perhaps all the talk about pay - by - mile is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that Congress could more easily deal with the bankruptcy highway trust fund problem by increasing the gas tax.
Additional one - time or annual charges may also be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other cars whose vehicles do not use much gas to pay their fair share.
"What is the need for radical surgery when aspirin can work?" said the commission's director of legislative and public affairs, Randy Rentsheller.
If we do that, millions of car drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, his death was due to drowning.
His friend has been detained by the police on the charge of concealing the deceased's belongings.
The police have submitted the final report of the death investigation to the court.
On 26th August, police recovered the body of Zahid Iqbal from Jhelum Dariya, a resident of Padshahi Bagh.
His family had accused his friends of killing him because his mobile phone and other belongings were missing.
In the report, the police said that the deceased's phone and SIM were checked and found that his phone was being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman inquired said that she had been given this phone by a relative of hers, Ruhail Gauhar.
Ruhail also lives in Padshahi Bagh and was a friend of the late Zahid.
Ruhal had gone to take a bath with Zahid in Jhelum after the Namaz - e - Jumma on August 25.
Zahid unbutted his clothes and laid all his belongings on the shore, while Ruhal went to the other side to smoke a cigarette.
When he came back, he was not there, only his clothes.
Ruhail looked for Zahid, but he was nowhere to be found.
He took his mobile phone, watch and other belongings and put them to his use.
He did not tell anyone that Zahid had drowned.
The police told the court that Zahid died from drowning and the post mortem confirmed the same.
However, Ruhel has been taken into custody under Section 404 for concealing facts and dead body's belongings.

MRF awarded with JD Power Award for 10th consecutive time
Chandigarh: MRF, India's largest tyre manufacturer and one of the top 15 global tyre companies, has been awarded JD Power Award for the tenth consecutive time.
The award is widely regarded by peers in the automotive sector as the equivalent of the Oscar and holds the highest recognition in the industry.
Very few companies have received this award for so many years in a row.
MRF has added a range of perfumed radial tires for higher end vehicles called MRF JLO.
Low profile tyres in the 40, 45 and 55 categories are now available for many other vehicles ranging from Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. The 13 size range now includes models of more than 70 premium vehicles on Indian roads.
The water purifier has been donated by the Du Gard company for clean drinking water in the Lord Valmiki temple of Naya Nangal.
After receiving the water purifier donated by the company representatives JK Kaushik and Khushbu Kaushik, the temple chairman Virendra Aditya said that this work of social service is commendable as now the devotees coming to the temple will be able to use clean drinking water.
Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 77, who is known for his bungalow parties, has secretly married a 28-year-old woman.
This was revealed by his family friend Martel Polanco.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been prime minister three times, married former TV anchor Francesca Pascal in his private chapel.
Francesca met Balusconi when she was a teenage activist in the Forza Italia party.
This is Francesca, whose relationship with Balusconi was said to be a sham.
Martel Polanco, Berlusconi's close friend and a booty-booty girl, has revealed that she too was invited to the wedding.
The ceremony took place three weeks ago.
In an interview with Italian Radio 2, when asked what would happen if they got married, Polanco said they were already married.
It was not a public event.
The wedding took place in the private chapel of the former Prime Minister's residence.
No one can say anything else.
She did not attend the wedding, however.
He has sent his congratulations to the newlyweds.
The couple got married about three weeks ago, on October 8 or 9.
8 months ago he was engaged to Francesca Pascal, a 28-year-old woman, who was 50 years younger than him.
To avoid the scandal, Berlusconi had based his decision on loneliness.
Even in the low - lying areas, the rain continued intermittently amidst the sun's glare.
With this, the cold wave has started in the entire valley.
The cold weather can be gauged from the fact that the minimum temperature has reached 4.8 degrees Celsius in Srinagar, minus 0.2 degrees below zero in Gulmarg and minus 1.8 degrees Celsius in Leh.
Leh was the coldest in the whole state.
At the same time, due to rain and snowfall, the strategically important Srinagar-Leh National Highway has been closed to traffic.
There is heavy snowfall on the Jojila Pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of this season in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activation of the Western Disturbance, snowfall in the high mountainous areas of the Valley started as early as early as Virwar and rainfall in the lowlands continued till late evening.
The cold affected the common life.
People stayed inside to avoid the cold.
Meanwhile, power supply was also cut in many areas.
The maximum daytime temperature of Srinagar was recorded at 13.7 degrees below normal.
In Jammu too, the rains with the strong winds of the morning have increased the cold at night.
Minimum temperature recorded in Jammu was 16.6 and maximum 27.0 degrees Celsius.
According to the Meteorological Department, the effect of the Western Disturbance is decreasing and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Sonam Lots, Director of the Srinagar based Meteorological Department, the weather in the valley is likely to be dry from November 1 to November 7.
Asaram, who is in jail on sexual harassment charges, was once again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday.
Asaram argued that media coverage was portraying him as a Dracula who drank the blood of children, but the court rejected his demand to ban the media coverage.
A bench of Chief Justice P Sathivam refused to order the media to stop reporting on Asaram, saying that they had seen every word reported in the media and saw no reason to interfere.
How can we stop them when they are getting information from the police and others.
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of exaggerating the news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
But the bench was not impressed by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter, saying that they had other options.
A previous court had rejected Asaram 's demand to ban media coverage.
The department officials claim that this is the biggest TDS theft case so far.
The mall group operator has paid TDS to the financial institutions concerned but has not paid it to the government treasury.
By doing so, he kept the TDS money with him.
The group was targeted by the Mumbai search team on October 17 along with the Jaipur search team.
The same link revealed that the trader had deducted TDS but did not deposit it.
That is why the TDS team on Thursday started the Income Tax Survey on this group.
The risk of the account being sealed was raised by the raid and survey of the group of the mall operator about 15 days ago.
Angry over this action, the businessman has made it clear to the officials of the Income Tax Department that he is not yet ready to pay the amount of TDS to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting them.
The investigating officers in this case have clarified that in case of non - payment, recovery action will be taken by sealing the account.
The demand for sweets increases with the coming of Diwali.
This leads to an increase in the sale of fake and substandard maves.
Chemicals are used to make the sweetness more sparkling, colourful and sweet, which is hazardous to health.
The Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against counterfeit food and chemical sweets.
The Department seized a Mawa of 70 thousand from Madhya Pradesh and a Chamacham of 5 thousand from Quetta Colony.
With the increase in demand for sweets in the market, the demand for quality Mave from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department received information that the poor cattle were being brought from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
The transport garage is being used to transport the cargo to Nagpur.
The department seized the mave, which was valued at Rs.
No one, for fear of reprisals, claimed any right to Mawe.
The department considered it unclaimed property and destroyed it.
The department raided the Jeetendra Caters at Quetta Colony and recovered about 5 thousand specimens.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulphite was used to make the sparkle shine and last longer.
A sample will be sent to the laboratory.
The Co - Commissioner of the Department, SS Deshmukh said that the campaign to catch chemical sweets and fake and fake food will continue.
The Department has given information to expedite the operation in the next few days.
Consumption of these sweets can also cause poisoning.
The department asked the confectioners to make sweets from good milk, honey.
The Department has appealed to the people to beware of fake sweets and mews.
Forty two senior leaders of the BJP from the state greeted him at the airport.
It is noteworthy that Modi has come to Bihar for a condolence visit organised by the BJP.
The convocation of the 'Santvana Yatra' is a BJP exercise to embalm the relatives of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is noteworthy that on October 27th, a total of seven blasts occurred in Patna, one after another, during Narendra Modi's rally.
The Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts had the intention of making a run - up during the rally, so that more people would be killed and an atmosphere of terror would be created in the state.
The terrorists ' attempt failed, but six people were killed in the explosions.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
The party leaders have been on the journey since Thursday, carrying the ossuary from their village.
On November 5, the ashes of all of them will be flowed together in the Ganges in Patna.
The consolation visit is part of this journey.
The main character is Narendra Modi.
He will visit the villages of the victims of the blasts from 7 am on Saturday and meet their relatives.
During the visit, he will also hand over cheques of Rs.
The BJP has already announced this financial help.
The Indian team, excited by the spectacular win in the last match, will be aiming to capture the series with a win when they play Australia in the seventh and final ODI at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
India had to win the Nagpur ODI in any case to stay in the series after two consecutive ODIs were washed out due to rain and their batsmen put up a resounding performance and gave them a record win, which tied the series 2 - 2.
India has twice achieved the target of more than 350 runs in the series and once again the responsibility of crossing the line will be on the batsmen.
The Indian batting is at its peak and the biggest target is also proving to be a dwarf in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in great form, but the team will also have high expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as the opening is concerned, the team has such a solid opening pair in the form of Rohit and Shikhar, which is making the work of the other batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had a great partnership in the opening, giving Virat a chance to play without any pressure.
The great performance of Kohli at number three so far has made him the future Sachin Tendulkar.
Many cricket pundits have even called him better than Sachin.
Virat, who will be 25 next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, of which India has won 16.
He has an average of 80.00 in the pursuit of the target and has emerged as a top finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in great form, but too much reliance on these three can be detrimental to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were both flops in the last match.
Yuvraj has not opened the account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in Bengaluru ODIs can be a lifeline for him.
As for Australia, its batsmen especially Captain George Bailey have impressed everyone with their performances.
He is also being sought in the Test squad for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia has good batsmen up to number nine.
Besides Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Heung and Aaron Finch have not made an impact in the opening.
The lack of bowling of Mitchell Johnson can be a huge blow to Australia.
Johnson, who has been performing well in the series so far, has been sent home for the Ashes series preparations.
Dr Jitendra Singh, BJP National Executive Member and Chief Spokesperson, said that Pakistan is working on a new policy of infiltrating terrorists under the guise of this sham peace.
Citing intelligence reports, Singh said in a statement issued here on Wednesday that Pakistan is working hard to infiltrate the nearly 2,000 terrorists trained in its training camps.
For this reason he will never let peace be established on the border.
Pakistan is further divided after the failure of the separatists ' plan to wreak havoc by inciting people in Kashmir.
Citing the visit of the separatists to Pakistan last year, the BJP leader said that ISI chief Lt Gen Zahir-ul-Islam, Lashkar, and Hizb chief Hafeez Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be given a chance in 2014.
Pakistan is seriously committed to fulfilling this promise.
The killing of soldiers at the border, the suicide attacks in Samba and Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Calling the demand to remove the privileges of the army in the state as a deadly move in such a situation, the BJP leader said that till there is permanent peace in the state, even such talk is anti-people.
They give breath to anti - national elements.
He stressed that the leaders should refrain from making statements that would demoralize the army, security forces.
Snowden willing to "cooperate" with Germany on American surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence informant, has declared that he is prepared to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to respond to his activities.
German MP Hans Christian Strauss-Bell met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he has been granted asylum, to talk about his testimony in Germany.
In a letter presented by Mr Snowden to the media in Berlin on Friday, the MP said: "Although the results of my efforts are demonstrably positive, my government treats dissent as partisan, and offers no defence to attempts to criminalise political speech with accusations of hooliganism".
However, telling the truth has not been a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed he could persuade the US government to drop the criminal charges against him with the support of the international community.
The charges filed by the US Department of Justice involve espionage and theft of government property.
Hans Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, told online Zeit: "Mr. Snowden has been willing to talk to German officials, so we have to find ways to make it happen".
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure after claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, MP, who chairs the parliamentary committee that oversees intelligence, said that if Mr Snowden had the opportunity to be heard as a witness "without completely ruining relations with the US and putting them in danger", then it should be taken.
Mr. Straub Biele, a Green Party MP in Germany, posted a picture of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He said that two German journalists were on their way to Russia.
Mr. Belström said that, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, the Snow Dens are not able to return to Russia if they leave.
If Snowden testified in Germany he would be "safe" there, which would require assurances, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had been forced to leave his home because of "the terrible and continuous campaign he had faced".
However, he said he was delighted and overwhelmed by the global response to his work of political expression.
The United States - as well as the citizens of the world - and high officials have condemned the revelation of an irresponsible system of mass surveillance of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities "when the problems of the human condition have been resolved".
Frontier Airlines will charge for carry - on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 for carry - on store luggage for passengers on board their aircraft.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging $100 for a carry - on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, though on Wednesday it announced that passengers could keep the whole box.
The new carry - on charge is for bags in the overhead bin, therefore, small bags under the seat will still be free of charge.
Frontier said it will charge $ 25 if paid in advance, $100 if passengers wait to pay until they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O 'Malley said that the $100 fee is to acquire passengers in advance to take care of the charge.
"We don't want to charge that", he said.
Airlines started charging for first and second checked bags in 2008.
Passengers who are trying to avoid the fee are stuffing as much as they can into carry - on baggage which is stacked in the overhead compartment, meaning there is often less space in this compartment.
The charge is a way to bring less for the passengers on board.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising money for the new charge.
It's about Frontier's most loyal customers that it's becoming increasingly difficult to find an overhead bin replacement.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay this.
That means that this is why the next person in line may have to pay 100 dollars for a similar bag, while a passenger in line at a border gate may get one bag free.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure that passengers are aware of the fees before getting to the gate.
Frontier's new carry - on fee will not start until summer although a date has not been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but the airlines like them.
They argue that it costs money to handle luggage, and that those who want service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are seen by many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most have not even touched the carry - on bag charge though.
Spirit Airlines Inc. first introduced carry-on charges three years ago, and its partner discount airline Allegiant Air followed.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary 's Wizz Air, said airline consultant J Sorensen, and which tracks add - on fees.
He said that Spirit's carry - on fees bring in $ 50 million a year, which was estimated in a December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew in Spirit and expressed surprise at the unusual carry - on bag fees that passengers face at the gate.
"The boarding process was the most seamless I had seen in my airline career", he said.
I was hoping to grind my teeth and look out at a battle gate.
"The plane was full and they boarded it lickety-split".
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier says that travelers who buy soda, or juice, can keep the whole can, and they'll give this free coffee only once.
It'll give the water away again.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but after complaints from passengers seven months later they backed out and no other major airline followed after being there.
Frontier 's move to charge a fee on carry - on if a passenger does not purchase directly from the airline is its latest attempt to drive customers to its own website.
The airline pays online travel seller Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This is why all airlines have been given an incentive to direct passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone further in this area.
In September, many frequent flyer miles began to be given away half-way to customers who had purchased from these individuals through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday it reduced the mileage award to 25 per cent of the trip mile.
So, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows sole passengers to choose their seat in advance when they purchase directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is shrinking and it's losing money.
Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flight capacity fell by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
Republic Airlines is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the sale.
NSA blamed "internal error" instead of hackers for the website crash
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that some technical glitch caused our website to be down for a few hours, not hackers as some people claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a pre-scheduled update", the intelligence agency said in a statement emailed to the agency.
This problem will be solved this evening.
It is not true that the disruption was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDOS] attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours, and for some users the site was still inaccessible.
A spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not compromised at all".
The spokesman said that no classified information was at risk.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA's website by a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to send so much traffic to the target website that the server is overloaded and the site is shut down.
This cyber strategy is relatively crude and the attacks are not aimed at penetrating the internal network of the target system.
The formerly secretive NSA, once dubbed "no agency", has been the subject of public discussion and harsh criticism in recent months over the revelation of a large number of foreign and domestic espionage programs - collectively, after the theft and disclosure of classified NSA files by the disbanded former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the agency has led to speculation that the incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The beautiful expression was presented in accordance with the plot of 'Another Dronacharya' showing harmony between the Dvapra era and today 's circumstances.
It was shown that in today 's world a guru is bound by the chains of a false path.
The play was inaugurated by the Chief Guest MLA Prabuddayaal Valmiki, the Vice Chairman of the Chhavani Parishad, Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh in the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College.
The drama depicted the similarity of the circumstances of Dronacharya of the Dwapar era and Professor Arvind of the present.
In the play directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bechain, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vanshi Chhatravedi, Aidid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. gave a great performance while doing justice to the characters.
The lighting was done by the young colorist Jitendra C. Raj and the set was designed by Hemant Kumar.
The ceremony was followed by the presentation of various awards to the personalities who have made literary and cultural contributions on behalf of AptA.
The stage was given to Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, Head of Urdu Department of Singh Viva, Senior Journalist Shambhunath Shukla and Colorist Jitendra C. Raj.
Secretaries Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc. were among the functionaries of the Executive who contributed to make the event a success.
Bombardier's profits decline, orders fall as aircraft are delivered
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc. reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, in its rail unit in the third quarter and contract issues as pressured by lower aircraft orders and deliveries.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or issue an update on whether the aircraft will complete its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service from next September.
After the first flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, it has only been flown three times, the question has been raised whether the test phase is on track.
The result fell short of forecast and the stock has sent the Toronto Stock Exchange sliding more than 8 per cent.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst with National Bank Financial shares had lowered its rating from "moth" to "area performance" on Thursday as the stock is up during the next one or two quarters from limited.
"While weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly expected, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation", Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for the Bombardier CSeries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, it is doubtful that the market will be suspicious of the programme.
Bombardier hopes the aircraft family can now cut it at the lower end of the market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and after months of delay was flown for the first time in September.
Buyers are waiting for the flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as firm orders for the CSeries are up to 177.
403 total orders and commitments available with 15 subscribers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Baudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet was put into commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and media on Thursday that the event was proceeding as scheduled.
"The test aircraft was on the ground longer than predicted", Baudoin said in a conference call, adding that the ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's interval.
Each manufacturer makes a different schedule.
We had decided to do a first flight and do an update period and say that we have done.
That's why the flight schedule will be all through.
The remaining part of the second of five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the second following shortly after, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical that the customer can begin operating a CSeries aircraft in the first 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier has said that it evaluated the Entry in Service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - confirms our view that entry into service will be pushed to Q1 / 15", Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $ 147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $ 172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.

New research has shown that we work with utmost sincerity and dedication in the morning.
They do not lie to anyone and do not think of stealing or cheating.
But by the end of the day, we change our minds and we put aside the ideal and start acting against the norm.
Researchers from Harvard University and the David Eccles School of Business at Utah have come up with some interesting facts.
Researchers have found that while we tend to prefer our moral values when we are relaxed in the morning, we tend to prefer our integrity when we are tired or under pressure in the evening.
The researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to be told whether the dot was more on the left or the right.
Participants were told that if they gave the wrong answer instead of the right answer, they would be paid.
The experiment showed that the people who were tested between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistakes and gave correct answers.
At the same time, when the experiments were conducted on the subjects between 12 noon and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their principles on the table.
This allowed the researchers to prove that while money-grubbing in the morning doesn't affect our honesty, it does by the evening when we stop giving priority to morality.
The research has been published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.
After the robbery, the thugs fled, waving their weapons.
The family has taken the injured in critical condition to the hospital.

When Sundar resisted, the thugs shot him in the stomach, injuring him.
The family and villagers who were informed of the incident took him to the hospital in Meerut in a critical condition.
No report had been filed in the case till the news was published.
Three days ago, while returning home from the same bank, Jasvir, a resident of Ammanulapur, was shot and wounded by two thugs on a bike.
Police have not been able to reveal any more recent cases.
SO Sumer Singh Yadav claimed that the incidents would be exposed soon.
The hotel staff protested and started beating him.
The drunken MP 's son started a scuffle with the younger brother of the hotel owner, R. K. Singh, who had come to the rescue.
Meanwhile, many more people came.
When he tried to catch the beating youth, he fired a revolver.
The shooting caused a sensation in the area.
The hotel staff then arrested him and called the police.
The hotel owner Munna Singh, who had arrived at the police station, lodged a report against Anand Pandey, son of the MP Gorakhnath Pandey, a resident of Berwa Paharpur, Koirana Police Station, Bhadohi district.
The police arrested him and confiscated the revolver.
According to India Inspector Ashok Saraswat, Munna Singh, a resident of Pratapgarh, runs a hotel named Rag Darbar on the National Highway.

Jail for cocaine-addicted lawyer who leaked police investigation information to Mr Big
42-year-old Bashrat Dutta was an informant for the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer thought that people might find out about his secret drug addiction.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
The lead defence lawyer who told Mr Big about the main police investigation because he was afraid people would find out about his secret drug addiction has been jailed for three years.
After Barashat Ditta, 42, was compromised by his cocaine addiction, the notorious criminal provided Neal Scarborough with sensitive confidential information about his drug trafficking activities.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" and hailed by the criminals as a "top brief", was arrested in 2011 from his home in Scarborough following a police surveillance operation, which he had represented in the previous narcotics trial.
Authorities found Scarborough, 32, with three bags of cocaine at the solicitor's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a law society dinner with his colleagues.
Investigations after the discovery of cocaine particles in Dutta's hair, wallet, and credit card revealed that Dutta was a "regular user" of Class A drugs.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at the time as part of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine gangs operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 others who were sent to jail after police seized £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine, and more than £200,000 in cash, during a series of raids.
42 - year old Dutta used to provide information to criminals, as he was afraid that people would not know about his cocaine addiction.
Blackburn situation Ditta, of the law firm Forbes Solicitors, was facing a mistrial today in Liverpool Crown Court after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He had confessed to cocaine possession in an earlier hearing.
The lawyer's bad times began when the police, while investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found him entering Dittas house and placing drugs of more than 60 purity under the lawyer's bin in a black golf glove.
Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta after the drug was administered, who had gone out for dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching the house, the lawyer found that there was a drug store and that there had been nine conversations between them.
The court heard that Ditta was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine in the trials, after traces of Class A drug were found on his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine and said he was talking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and said their discussions were a matter of "legal privilege".
During his arrest Dutta tried to remove a number of credit cards by removing his wallet, but they were confiscated, and a hair sample was taken.
In the interview he said that he ran the police office from his workplace as well as his home, and his clients called him at home for legal matters.
After the arrested principal persons had told what the spies knew about them, the court heard that Dutta used to call the principal persons in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had brought the case before.
Annie White, for the prosecution, said: "The criminal lawyer should be best known for not breaking the law".
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal advocate, becoming too involved with his particular client.
We are not talking about the relationship of a normal drug dealer, but of a dealer who is supplying drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been legal, no doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went far beyond his own limitations of the lawyer - client relationship.
He interfered with the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not honoring his profession, but insulting it.
He had made too close contacts with certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed himself to compromise his freedom.
Detta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr Scarborough I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: "Mr Ditta changed from criminal solicitor to criminal at the same time he started obtaining drugs from organised crime".
His cocaine addiction made him highly compromised and much more vulnerable to the aims of his leading members of organized crime groups, who used him to obtain important information relating to police investigations.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of integrity and instill trust and confidence in the people.
Mr. Dutta has betrayed this trust and has tried to hide his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit investigated Mr. Ditta, finding him guilty of three counts of cocaine possession and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring the perpetrators to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to the criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty - five other gang members were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offenses.
On her website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about herself, in which she said her fantasy job would be to be a lawyer for a client facing the death penalty in the US, with Muhammad Ali as her dinner guest and inequality as the inspiration for her work.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying that "it is a terrible place to be, and it is legitimate to ask: What is there to prevent Parliament from taking away the independence of the judiciary in the coming future?"
Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group - the company that operates Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM - said: "This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it".
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is a government body" and said that banning content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to the MPs", he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the new bill would give the government "tough control over the media", while The Standard said that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had been "deeply shaken" and called the bill "cruel".
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after the attack by an Islamist gunman at the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media broadcast security camera footage of the squads sent to the scene of the attack, showing them deliberately looting the mall, which angered the Kenyan media.
Police Chief David Kimayo had issued summonses to two journalists and media personnel for questioning, although the summons was withdrawn after a media uproar.
The new bill would impose fines of up to 2 crore Kenyan shillings on media companies and up to 1 million Kenyan shillings on individual journalists, and would also put them at risk of "de-listing" or not being recognised by the official press.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the offender if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "one penalty is enough to shake the foundations of most FM stations".
It also said these measures could have a devastating impact on what it described as Kenya's "vibrant blogosphere".
By shutting up the media, politicians know they can do as they please.
Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew describes Kenyan media as a major source of checks and balances in public life, writing that "no one will ever know".
He wrote, "If left to politicians, they will bankrupt the country and return us to the era of hunting and hoarding".
In the past, Kenyan legislators have faced public anger.
In May he voted to reject the cuts ordered by the National Pay Commission, and restored a tax - free salary of about 532,000 shillings per month, considered among the highest in the world.
The birthday of the wife of the world 's richest Indian, Mukesh Ambani, is on November 1, but as soon as the clock struck twelve on the night of October 30, the whole of Jodhpur began to echo with Nita Ambani 's birthday.
Earlier, the atmosphere of celebration was entirely composed of the performance of AR Rahman 's team.
In this musical night which started at 8 pm, Rahman performed his signature songs.
Priyanka Chopra was on the stage to show off the beautiful colors of the dance.
About 32 charters arrived in Jodhpur for the guests attending Nita Ambani's birthday.
Due to the reduced parking space at Jodhpur Airport, the charter was parked at Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars including BMW and Jaguar were ordered.
Sood said that the city has completely failed in its cleanliness and street lights.
No steps are being taken by the Municipal Corporation and Huda to run the city centre of Panchkula.
He has demanded that Panchkula should abolish Gurukkar completely.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sood said that after the municipal elections, the city has got new councillors and mayors, but they do not have the power to get things done.
The city council has become a dummy and the officials are acting on their own.
Sood said that the Municipal Corporation has crores of rupees but all the money is being deposited in banks as FDs and interest is being collected.
But no steps are being taken to invest in the development of the city.
VK Sood said that the problem of dumping ground is the most serious.
Due to the construction of the dumping ground in Sector 23, the people living in the sectors across the Ghaggar have been forced to live a hellish life for the past several years.
Municipal officials have been talking about shifting the dumping ground at Gao Zhuiriwala for several years, but the people of the Barwala area are already reeling from the serious problem of flies.
He said that the health services and education system in the villages have been in a bad condition.
No work has started to provide facilities to the people in rural areas.
UN sets new goals to fight poverty
The United Nations is about to begin work on a new set of goals, which will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
The Australian diplomat played a key role in advancing the "Sustainable Development Goals" to replace the MDGs, which are due to expire in 2015, just ahead of the overnight Sustainable Development Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
These were incorporated in the final draft of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms. Gillard during the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki - Moon said at the summit tonight that the time has come to "rise above national interests".
"I am very pleased that the Member States have agreed to initiate and own the process for establishing the Universal Sustainable Development Goals", he said.
These SDGs will build on our development under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to implement the mandate given to me by our member countries to fulfil our long-term objectives of Sustainable Development Goals, building on the success of MDGs.
Mozambique's security concerns grow as powerful personalities clash
With a statue of Mozambican founding president Samora staring down at them, thousands gathered in central Maputo in a rare public demonstration to chant the slogans of peace.
"We want peace back, we want stability", said Vanessa de Sousa, the chief executive of an investment firm.
Fearful of her country's future, she changed her corporate uniform from a T-shirt printed with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, clashes between government forces and RENAMO have been reported almost daily, more than 20 years after a peace agreement.
Re Nemo was once a notorious rebel in a movement supported initially by the white - ruled Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa as part of its efforts to destabilize the country 's independent government.
After the 1992 peace accord, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to return to full-blown conflict, but recent events have discouraged foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy. The discovery of the Northwest's vast offshore gas reserves and coal reserves could bring in more than $ 50bn in investment next year, some of the companies including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Well, Eni.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Rémy Némos blame each other for the tension.
The government launched its latest conflict on October 17 by launching an attack on its members in Sofa La Province, traditionally a RNM stronghold, says Ray Nomo.
The attack on the former rebels and the escalation of the government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Daka Ma, the leader of the group, Fernando Mazatzang, Renamo spokesman, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Ray Nammo for triggering the clash, accusing him of attacking troops.
President Armando Zibua has called for the dismissal of concerns about instability.
Mr. Djibouti told AFP, the French news agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama saw himself as a "loser" "whatever it is his armies are left to try to prove that they can impose their own judgment on the government".
Both Free Limo and Re Namo insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Majang was quoted as saying that the 1992 Re Nammo peace accord was canceled but has since become a concern.
He told the FT that means he's not being honored by the Free Limo deal.
Our vision is to come back to the negotiations, but seriously", said Mr. Mahashange.
Previous talks between the two sides did nothing to lessen the tensions of a series of clashes this year.
"It's about two big men (Gibbons and Dhaka) fighting side by side", said Yousaf Khan, a lecturer at the London Open University and a Mozambican expert.
Neither are they good negotiators nor are they necessarily ready to make concessions of any kind.
Remo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already spoken of boycotting the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as a morbid movement 's attempt to win concessions and financial plunder from the government.
Re-Namo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), was created by a former Re-Namo member in hopes of improving its performance in the elections.
Mr. Manjang says Mr. Jebujanko - who is leaving office at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multiparty democracy, he does not want to give up the presidency because he does not want peace, does not want transparent elections, " Mr. Massang said.
What kind of capability Re Nemo has is unclear, but it is a major north south highway on which he has made disruptive hit and run trips to police stations and vehicles.
Most of the clashes are in the province of La Mancha, several hundred kilometers north of Zomaputo, which hosts the port of Bira, which relies on miners, including Rio Tinto and the Valley, to export coal.
The Rio Railways suspended its operation for almost a week in June after the threat of an attack on the Namo line.
When asked whether Rema would be able to repeat the threat, Mr. Manjangwinath was almost certain.
"Things were not going well in Mozambique which the international community wanted to be aware of", Mr Majang said.
The government of instability has further exacerbated the tensions, says Fernando Lima, Media Cop, who heads an independent media company, while many people are also concerned about corruption, slow growth and the recent flood of kidnappings.
"The people responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and I think he should be the one to find solutions to the problems", he says.
The Sultanate of Omar, a demonstrator, people still want stability.
"Nobody cares about Ray Nomo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads", he said.
Children should be taught "the way of life of the author as a model for the myths and legends.
The tales of Thor could show "there is no contest in brute strength to subtle cunning", while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Even to teach many of the myths "exceptionally far from the wild and in some cases obscene and it would not be appropriate to teach it in schools", Cross Lee Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age - appropriate tasks.
"I find it surprising that in America, myth and folklore are already a part of the education", he said.
I've been advocating this as a plan for twenty years.
He called writers and teachers "overeducators" and said that this is "a new trend" for children, with messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Crossley Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote the Penguin Book of Norwegian myths and British folklore, said: "You can have many intentions but it is better to keep them out of sight".
Perhaps the big difference between writing for an adult and writing for a child requires some sense of hope.
Everything is to be simplified or to come to a happy ending, because but it is an instinctive sense of right and wrong.
and that should be submitted rather than told through a story revealed.
Old base is not showing.

Ben Greemann: The New Yorker: The tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival, which is now in its fifth year.
One might argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: about a hundred years ago, comedian Frank Fein, who served as the Master of Ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the audience in a conversational manner.
Fey's discovery has expanded over the years, most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, created and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the standup institute Caroline's, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners appeared in the Carolinas, and became huge hits, to the point where they became too big to be played in clubs", says Hirsch.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the presence of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual musical and comedy benefit for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes" which featured Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many of the comedians participating in this year's festival are from non-traditional mediums, such as shows on smaller networks like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll, who rose to prominence with the deep-cable sitcom (F.X.X.'s hilariously ranchy fantasy-football-themed "The League"), now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", though she is best known for her viral video series "Marshall the Shell with Shoes On".
Other young comedians with distinct voices, including Kroll and Slate (w. C. Camaw Bell, with a completely different, disillusioned voice, satirical, ethnically focused, and Anthony Jeselinik) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the celebration will be an interview with David Steinberg:
Steinberg started out as a standup comedian, but has become a well-known television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted the show "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at the Town Hall in the heart of Manhattan.
Steinberg said, "The city is definitely in the comedic DNA of all of Larry's work".
He told me that when he was here, he would sometimes go into the alley between the two buildings and think to himself that if I ever lost all my money I would stay here.
Oil continues to fall towards $ 96 a barrel
The fall in oil prices continues as a report on Friday showing concerns about oversupply is offset by China 's growing power-hungry manufacturing sector.
The benchmark for December delivery of American crude was down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel late in the morning in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in Europe.
The contract is down 5. 8 percent for the month of October, fell 39 cents on Thursday.
The ample supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week, the Department of Energy said Wednesday.
Over five weeks, the supply has increased by more than a quarter of a million barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand showed a surge in activity that two reports on Chinese manufacturing came out Friday.
This suggests that growth may continue to strengthen China 's economic recovery after a two - decade low in the third quarter of 7.8 percent in the previous quarter.
Brent Crude, also a benchmark for international crude oil used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents from $108. 58 a barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks action on NYPD's rest and recreation policy
On Thursday a federal appeals court blocked changes to the New York Police Department's rest and recreation program requiring a judge's order and removed the judge from the case.
Judge Shira Schindler of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that the judge's decision will be pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge in the town had ruled in August that it violated the Constitution by way of stopping people and excluding them from its program of interrogation.
The city's police department has appealed its findings and its remedial order, including the decision to allocate a monitoring to help in the change in its policy and the associated training programme.
The appeals court heard the arguments on Tuesday on the request stay.
The Court has said that because he agreed to the requirement for a judge to avoid the appearance of bias in part of a series of media interviews and publicly criticized the Court of Appeals for statements he made in violation of the US Code of Conduct for Judges, the judge should therefore be removed from the case.
The judge ruled that police officers had wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its break and sports program.
He has hired an outside monitor to oversee major changes including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and he has ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some premises where they are most often turned off.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police stop.
An oral argument on the appeal of the Nagar is scheduled for some time after 14th March 2014.
The pause and play tactic has been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The leisure and sports policy has been around for decades in some form, but has increased dramatically under the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, from 684,330 to an all-time high in 2011, mostly from black and Hispanic men.
A lawsuit filed by four men all of them minorities in 2004 became a class action case.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's break and sports program have said that the end of improper behavior will require a more credible and effective police force and may affect other police departments' policy use.
Opponents say the changes will reduce police morale, but will solve a wider problem of a police force under pressure after being shrunk by thousands of officers over the past decade, not crime, and waste of money.
The judge has noted that the termination was not for rest and recreation, which is constitutional, but improved the NYPD' s enforcement of the stop.
The training was attended by a large number of participants from Ghoda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chhatra districts.
During the seven days, all the participants were introduced to several disciplines including tent pitching, flag pole, and so on.
The training obligation is being fulfilled in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
The spirit of unity is being spread by all the participants by joining the prayer of Sarvadarma.
Camp Principal Vipin Kumar, State Training Commissioner is giving his special support.
Coulson used phone hacking to confirm classified information.
Andy Coulson, a former editor of the News of the World, has been charged with using "phone hacking, surveillance and face - to - face" in an attempt to confirm a so - called secret information about Charles Clarke's affairs while he was home secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis Q.C. told the Old Bailey that the News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was dating his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The court said the newspaper had hired private investigator Glenn Mulcair to hack into Polby's voicemail and "keep an eye on" the man, but Coulson called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Addis said that "the prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside people's homes and watch them, but that he puts the articles in front of people, to see how they react to it".
He said that the NOTW used three methods to investigate the cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third involved the editors themselves.
He obviously knew about the other way, the vigilante, he must have known.
What about the first one?
Did he know about the phone hacking?
They say, no, we say, "Yes, he knew all along".
The rumor about Clarke's affairs was first brought to light by the A. O. T. W. feature desk when a sexually-oriented source in Ms. Polby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles".
From home in August 2006, from Mulcare, at least three tapes of the voicemail were seized from Ms. Polby's phone.
The investigators also found entries in the private investigator's computer that named Ms. Polby and her sister as "projects".
During the period of the investigation, Ms. Polby 's grandparents were called anonymously to inquire about her.
During this period, former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former Reporter James Weatherup witnessed the surveillance of Ms. Polby.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson sent him a voice mail saying: "I have a story we are planning to run tomorrow, which I would definitely like to discuss with Charles".
Mr. Addis said that Coulson's involvement in the case is in the same patch as other key figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The bench heard on Thursday that Coulson had conversations with Mr. Blanket about having affairs with a married woman while he was handling the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied colluding with others to hack phones between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcare, Thurlbeck and WeatherUp have admitted to phone hacking.
NSA disclosures about state surveillance fueled corporate fear.
On a quiet day in late August, a German police helicopter crashed into the American consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
At the behest of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take a picture of the roof of the US outpost, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media asked the BfV to identify the presence of the listening antenna and hinted at an exchange of operatives between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Klepper, the director of U.S. national intelligence, insisted that the U.S. should not use its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal foreign companies' trade secrets and to enhance the international competitiveness of American companies or to increase their bottom line". Again in September.
But since Edward Snowden, a whistleblower turned contractor, began revealing his treasure trove of secrets to American surveillance, European government and business leaders are no longer sure that the director will keep his word.
The US National Security Agency reportedly spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras, and our cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, and Yahoo expressed fears about state surveillance.
The final blow came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful individuals can be targeted, certainly business leaders are also potentially targeted.
Snowden has made deep cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible to use this data for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up", says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by the German consultancy, the US is now almost as big a risk as China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
In all the documentation leaked by Mr. Snowden, there is, however, to date no evidence that the United States knew the trade secrets of foreign companies for its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the EU's lack of Internet capabilities and it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Haso Platner, president of the German business software company SAP, said, "This is no way".
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, then he should not have been allowed to die 20 years ago.
Everything is concessionary in Germany, from coal, cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden's revelations about America's technological sophistication and intelligence access have proven to be a shock to some companies who previously believed that the biggest surveillance threat was China.
There is a big change happening in the cloud computing space where European officials are more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially sensitive.
According to a survey released by Cloud Security Alliance, a trade association, some 10 percent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after the data-mining program Prism was revealed.
Jim Schnabe, co-CEO of SAP, says: "We noticed a new question that customers didn't have a year ago is: Where is my data stored? And can you guarantee that it will physically stay in that jurisdiction?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are simply confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and data and that they should be guarded at all costs.
That economic espionage happens is not a surprise.
It always has.
"This has been a topic for many years, and through the fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed", says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
The Americans spy on us commercially and industrially, and we do, because it's in the national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in defences and this is an advantage for the aggressor.
For large companies, long-standing message recording has been happening whether it's unwise to leave a USB stick in the business at home, or a laptop unattended in a hotel room is unwise to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of carmaker Audi, says, "It's a very old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they can't be used as remote listening devices".
Germany's BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile when smart phones are compromised due to risk on overseas tours.
Prepaid mobile phones were later thrown away.
However, the risk of hacking and surveillance of small and medium-sized companies is a concern.
In Germany, it's many companies that top the global market in particular space.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access", warns the BfV in a report.
The US has warned about economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
France named US national intelligence in February as a second tier of criminals involved in hacking, which is behind China's economic intelligence, along with Russia and Israel, according to The Washington Post.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, when it comes to financial espionage, "the French are the worst.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRI, states in an interview: "The services are well aware that all countries, even if they are fighting in non-terrorist wars, are spying on their partners".
The Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial levels, and we do, because it's in the national interest to protect our businesses.
No one was fooled.
The parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a "strange" accident believe their son was murdered
A teenage Georgia boy whose body was found wrapped in a wrestling mat in his high school gym believes his son was murdered, a family attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, GA, was found inside his high school gym on January 11 trapped in a mat standing upright behind bleachers.
The Landis County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson had died in a freak accident, but the 17-year-old boy's family denied this.
Benjamin Crump, the attorney representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that "they absolutely believe that their son has been murdered".
He has no faith in the way the sheriff has described death.
"He believes that this is beyond the physical laws and logic of common sense", said Cramp.
They feel that this finding is an excuse to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
He said that he sent his son to school with a book-back, and he came back in a body bag.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mulroney said Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that many important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he killed for some crime?
Murray made the remarks at a news conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they lead us.
My aim is to bring out the truth.
He said that "I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation".
Moore told the reporter that initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of "positional respiratory arrest".
According to Moore, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death".
He said that "there are many questions that need to be answered or confirmed".
Moore also said that if he found enough evidence to summon a criminal or conduct a civil rights investigation into Johnson' s death, he would ask the FBI to do so.
A representative from the Londage County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a judge in south Georgia ordered the officers to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope video footage will give some clues as to how he died.
CDC releases guidelines for schools on child allergy
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released guidelines for controlling food allergies in school children.
The guidelines are the first issued by the U.S. government as the number of schoolchildren suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one in every 20 children in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about food allergy in children and how to handle it in case of any allergic reaction.
Schools have also been advised to stockpile epinephrine - the most commonly used auto-injector of the Epine brand - to combat potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis.
The state legislature recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily stockpile more epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children with allergic reactions.
Children can say "It feels like something is pinching my tongue", "It feels like there's hair on my tongue", or "It feels like my tongue is tingling".
Parents of intersex children can choose the gender of their children indefinitely
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognize a third gender for children born with undescribed genitalia.
Newborns will no longer be assigned male or female in the traditional way.
Parents are not required by law to declare the sex of a new baby, but are allowed to declare the sex "not specified" on the child's birth certificate.
The legislation aims to reduce pressure on new parents who may rush into decisions regarding gender - specific surgery for newborn babies, and to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman".
I will remain the scarred, spotted footprint created by the doctors.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the scope of sexual developmental disorders, the collective term for abnormal chromosomes, genitals (ovaries or testes), or abnormally developed sex.
It is possible that Wallis Simpson was intersex.
Gender identity is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to determine the sex and to monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before surgery, if such a misconduct occurs.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York City psychologist who specializes in gender identity issues, said that Germany's new law "seems like a good thing".
Intersex children are the cause of moral confusion.
He said, "Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most children don't".
You can determine gender without surgery, and then see how identity develops.
The science of how a sex will develop in a child is not very precise.
No one can give a satisfactory answer as to why this happens.
It's a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
In a 2011 report filed with the European Commission, intersex people are described as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not related to gender but to their biological composition, which is neither explicitly male nor female but is either a combination of both or neither is clearly defined.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sex characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breasts and length; primary sex characteristics such as genitalia and genitalia; or in chromosomal structure and hormones.
The report provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of employment, as well as harassment, violence and prejudice crimes.
There are now special camps for boys of the non - conforming sex.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to mark male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to keep her "genderless" status for life.
According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the German passport will have a third specification in addition to M or F as X for intersex persons.
According to news reports on France 24, issues related to gender are still controversial in neighbouring France.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country signed a petition to withdraw "gender theory" from school textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online also opposed the German law, saying, "While the world is moving toward a situation where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we are moving two other pillars of civilization in the opposite direction".
The mother of a newborn in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would like to see children assigned a gender at birth.
"Parenting without additional boundaries is very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is", he said on the parenting website.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites, named after the beautiful Greek god who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered the penis to be a slate that could be erased and then written.
But now many are challenging the ethics of surgery, recognizing that gender identity is a complex task, and sometimes even doctors can make mistakes, not knowing how children will feel about their gender specifications when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called the 'psychiatric emergency,'" Dresser says.
When these babies were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The current theory about the treatment of children with undetermined genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered gender to be determinable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues - how parents raise a child - interact with a child's genes and hormones to determine whether he is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan", his doctrines became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose sex had been accidentally removed during a circumcision to have the child completely bandaged, have her testicles removed and raise her as a girl.
"Money presented that case as a successful case of transition, but it was not", Dresser said.
At the age of 15, the child changed back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresser said that some doctors were still "following the same pattern".
But with the advent of the Internet in the late 1990s, individuals undergoing these penile surgeries began to come forward as "not happy with the results".
A similar case was with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with an XY male chromosome, but his genitals were indeterminate.
The doctors clearly did not understand whether his penis was small, or his scrotum was large, but they were certain that he could never live a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce 's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and she was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl".
I wasn't happy, but it was very hard to ask.
At the age of 18, she was going to have vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and confused, he asked for the medical records.
It was a terrible revelation.
I was taken captive at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from making enough testosterone, causing his genitals to fail to develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, took testosterone supplements and removed his breasts.
He became infertile due to surgery.
Today, she works with an organization called the Interface Project to help people normalize their views about intersex people.
But Annie Tamer-Mattis, executive director of the California - based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that Germany's law "invites cynicism and stigma".
"Many activists feel that the German law will encourage parents to make quick decisions and to designate the child 'undecided,'" she says.
We fear that this will encourage interference.
We think that instead of waiting, it is better to specify male or female gender.
But we do not know how the law will play its part, so we can only speculate.
Tamer-Mathews said her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to be identified as a third gender".
He said, "Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal sex".
The German law is concerned with specifying it at birth.
This is not a war fought by newborn babies at this time.
As they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their bodies.
But Dr. Erlin Baratz, a breast radiologist in Pittsburgh whose daughter has a sexual development disorder and who assists hundreds of others in support groups, said that Germany's law would "empower" both parents and children.
Baradzi's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she had a D.S.D. called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
As her androgen receptor was defective, female characteristics developed in Katy.
She has a vagina but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"This law allows parents to avoid making any hasty decisions on their own", said Baratz.
It gives them time and understanding properly by some tests before writing 'man' or 'woman'.
In this way, you stay well - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely baby and enjoy it.
We don't need to rush into a surgery that can't be reversed.
"It brings the kids into the decision-making process and frees the parents from the uncertainty that motivates them because they don't believe they're doing the right thing", he said.
Eventually, the child will determine which gender he is most comfortable with -- and that's a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
Legal Awareness Camp was organized by the Tehsil Legal Services Committee Ramanagar on behalf of the committee chairman and the sub judge of Ramanagar, Sandeep Kaur, at the middle school Dalher in Ramanagar.
In which students and others were informed about the right to education and the law for economically backward people.
Advocates ML Gupta, Rohin Bharadwaj and Sarpanch spoke on the subject and raised awareness among the people.
A large number of villagers were present at the event.
Report: Biden dumping Obama campaign thoughts for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama have secretly considered Hillary Clinton to replace Biden as the vice presidential ticket for 2012.
The most notable revelation is the highly anticipated 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Helleman, Tom, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the president's top advisers held "extensive group-sessions and polls in late 2011 " to find out whether dumping Biden could help Obama's waning re-election hopes.
According to Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book details the campaign's efforts to get the chief executive and the White House, named for former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to find out how former Secretary of State Clinton's transition from vice president impacted the polls.
The potential switch was a highly guarded secret within the Chicago campaign's infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only a half dozen knew the change was under consideration - including the president's close advisers - John Dalle, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Palaufaufe.
"Double Down" claims that Daley tried to change Biden despite his personal synchrony before finally making a decision when his information indicated that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Clinton with Biden.
"I was looking at the whole scene, and one of them was this", Dale told the newspaper.
You remember, the presidency was in danger at that time, so we were in a situation where we were like, "Holy Christ, what else are we going to do?"
While Dalle described the research as "cautious", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out how much dividend the claim would yield if the poll was made.
"Campaigns don't spend money on polls and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something", Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dale if his boss knew about the potential change.
While Daley said he "didn't think the president knew about the possible change", the former chief of staff believed it was "possible" that Obama knew.
"Double down" sure: won't answer whether she got to Obama's desk by doing political research, Martin said.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know about Biden's Dumping Tickets research.
"Possibly", said Martin.
Do you like glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken advantage of the sea creatures to develop the best breakfast.
He got the idea after reading a paper on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to use chemical glow to re-glow the protein.
Ice cream will react with the eater' s tongue to raise the pH of the protein and make the ice cream glow.
Chris says that ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth, so the more you lick it, the more it lights up.
"It's incredible, but the early days of production will get you about two grams of stuff for me from £200", said Charlie, founder of the company Lick Me I'm Delicious Ice Cream.
The protein we're using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As the mouth warms up, the proteins will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow.
We've been testing it for the last few months and it feels perfect to share on Halloween because it gives a wonderful glow effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the shiny jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each scoop costs me about 140 pounds.
Although iska tastes very good.
Charlie's Bristol - based experimental company is renowned for its unusual apne flavours, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf.
But his next work is going to be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream".
That's impossible naturally because of the ice crystals that form refraction on top of the ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is a jellyfish's fluorescent utility, synthesized by Chinese scientists
The entire market was jammed with customers in Rani Bagh Market.
Recently, people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy utensils.
This was the case in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market and the Central Market at Prasanth Vihar.
A similar sight was seen on the shelf shops of Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
Here too, people made a lot of purchases of gold and silver jewellery and coins.
This led to traffic jams in other markets including the Outer Ring Road.
However, those who had to leave for their homes had to spend hours in traffic jams to reach their homes.
Halloween 2013: by numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and play dress-up games for the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more than a greedy person.
I haven't even signed to give out candy from my apartment for the last two years and probably won't this year.
But statistics show that I'm a black sheep when Halloween comes.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans will actually spend $158 million this year for Halloween, $6.9 billion on candy and costumes and decorations.
One thing I've always noticed is every Halloween costume.
According to the NRF, out of the total $6.9 billion spent, the cost of clothing is estimated at $1.2 billion.
This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women shouldn't be prostitutes, because they're sexy food like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
For the men, I hope a lot of zombies, and thankfully for the dead, will make our Instagram feeds for space men this year.
According to Google, the most searched outfits would be zombies, Batman, bandits and thieves.
I guess there's nothing wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed the dogs and, surprisingly, we were not alone.
According to NRF, Americans literally spend $330 million on pet clothing.
Ironically, that is the case with many hot dogs.
We don 't look around when it comes to candy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to the Nielsen Company.
The Heirshy Bars, the Lollipops, the Milk Duds, the Tweeslers and the Clark Bar are worth about 600 million pounds.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it's good news that 41 million Trick or Tricks are participating in our neighborhood.
But in reality, we, and the jokers, will be buying 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectioners Association, one thing we won't use during Halloween is candy corn, but that too will sell for about 35 million pounds.
That 's the personal corn lump of about 9 billion.
It 's a mystery. Still to be solved.
There's nothing more elemental than a Halloween haunted house.
They have the best names, "Terror Behind the Wall" (which is, in fact, a prison), "Scream-O-Scream" and were "House of Shock".
According to the American authorities, there are actually 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States that generate 500 million in revenue, and those awfully nice pictures that your friend posts on Facebook and the guy who likes and comments on you is Nice Face.
Finally, let us talk about the pumpkin.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o-lantern carving is like decorating a Christmas tree -- it's something we've done since we were little.
Luckily for us, there was a "Baby in a Pumpkin" trend that started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these guards and not hanging out with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins this year.
Jack-o'-Lantern slowly twirling on his front porch, probably from Illinois, which this year grew by 542 million pounds of pumpkin.
If you're looking for extra credit, call Tim and Susan Matis in Napa, Calif., and try to carve their 2,032 - pound pumpkin upstairs.
MCA said in a statement, 'It was decided that a postage stamp with Sachin's photo during the presentation before the start of the match be issued.
This will be followed by a joint presentation by the BCCI and MCA.
Besides, a special coin will be used for the toss which will be handled by the MCA.
The MCA will also release a 64 page booklet containing articles related to Tendulkar and statements about him by people from the business, sports and journalism worlds.
The limited number of brochures and coins will be distributed to members of MCA and BCCI, the Union said.
He said that 10,000 masks, 10,000 score cards and 10,000 hats with Sachin's photograph will be distributed every day.

The dream of the firecracker merchants to trade in the firecracker market in the transport area was not realized.
The crackers are trapped in the mazdaar after the High Court order.
They are no longer allowed to trade in the makeshift crackers market set up in Ranjit Avenue, nor are they licensed to trade in the transport area.
The Commission constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court during its visit declared the temporary firecracker market at Ranjit Avenue as unsafe.
The Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar was also fined Rs.
In its order, the High Court has strongly reprimanded the administrative officials of Amritsar, saying that what kind of administration was it able to solve even one problem of the crackers for nine years.
They could not be provided with proper accommodation in the city.
After this, due security arrangements were made and the crackpots were asked to issue licenses for their business in the market at Shippangarh.
The firecracker merchants were happy about this order, but their happiness was turned upside down by the police on Friday.
The team of Aslaha Licence Branch of Police reached Pataka Market and sold the farm by setting up a counter there.
The conditions which were then laid before him were impossible to fulfil in a day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, Anup Kumar, in charge of Aslaha Licence Branch, SHO Sultanvind Arun Sharma, and others arrived at the Patakha Market.
He expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by the firecracker traders.
Therefore, no licenses were issued to the firecracker traders.
There is one day left for Diwali.
This has caused a lot of anxiety among the crackers.
They are facing a loss of crores of rupees.
The petaka businessmen Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni say that they will take a claim against the district administration if they lose crores of rupees.
Angry firecracker traders on Friday night marched from Shabgarh to Ranjit Avenue.
Slogans against the police and district administration.
After this, the temporary firecracker market in Ranjit Avenue was also closed.
In a mine 50 feet above the ground on the edge of a dangerous mountain, the fire brigade was called to rescue a lost puppy
The Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after a minor road collision.
He was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the mine.
Firefighters lowered the front part of the rock down the rope to save the dog from death
After being trapped by the puppy somehow 50 feet above the ground on the face of the dangerous mountain, the fire - fighters were called and he got a lucky break.
Nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after being involved in a road accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
Their owner Scott Elderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, of Denholm, were at the Flappit mine in West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again, and have thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After escaping from a minor accident, they went on a mad search for their lost dog, and posted an appeal on social networking sites.
At 2.15pm on Wednesday, a keen-eyed dockwalker spotted Ruby on the mountain in the mine, 50 feet above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Clackheaton Fire Station arrived on the scene and lowered Ruby by rope to save her and used a stomach tube to bring her down the cliff.
Andy Clayton, technical rescue specialist, said: "She was in a critical position.
It was in the middle of the face of the rock, and fifty feet from the top to the bottom.
She did not make a move during the defense, she remained a stone.
But she's fine now.
After that she was eating biscuits.
It was a most unusual cry for help.
The sight of the dog is incredible.
Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby has been lucky to survive".
He was likely to be seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where she was found to be well except for fatigue and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "The rescue was a terrible thing to witness".
At first I couldn 't believe how she got there.
It is wonderful to have her back in my arms.
The veterinarian said that if she got too tired and fell, she would certainly fall down.
The fire brigade did a very good job.
What they did was really very brave.
We are grateful to them, and they were all excellent.
Mr. Elderson, from Keighley, also said: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there".
The fire brigade did a great job.
I can't believe how she got there.
Mick Jagger says that when Katy Perry was 18, they didn't attack her
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, the PON star said that he sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said he had dinner with the senior rocker, and "when I was 18, he beat me up".
He said, "It's old-fashioned, and he treats me well".
The 70-year-old Jagger representative said in a statement Thursday that he "clearly denies ever striking Katy Perry".
The representative also said: "Possibly Parry, in the misunderstanding of another person, is saying about them"
Parie was one of the guest singers on the Rolling Stone tour this year.
His new album "Prism" reached the top spot this week.
George Carvan: The breakdown of the euro has given the Scots a choice
Another day, another story of freedom's fear
This time we have been warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the free travel zone across Europe as a condition of EU membership.
The stories about the border of the barricades on the passport control and the barbed wire on the walls of Hadrian.
True, the Strathclyde paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, though - predictably - it did not mention this in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe how EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as they see fit.
Since Scotland is no longer a Schengen area, Brussels will be cheaply relieved for Brussels of continuing non-compliance in exchange for getting what Scotland really wants.
So, again, the no-story.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long has been fixed. I first heard the "freedom means passport control" unsubstantiated news about 40 years ago.
Yet, the point was lost in retelling this interesting old story.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to bid for Europe anyway?
Why should the yoke of London be traded for Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: The great, postwar plan to organize Europe has finally come to a halt.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Parties across the EU are gaining strength to oppose the EU or to end the euro as the single currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party - founded this year - suddenly came out on top with almost half a million votes in the September federal election, effectively excluding the Free Democrats (the equivalent of our own Lib Dems) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis has proved to be a game changer.
The same stringent rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, along with the constraints imposed on national economies through complying with the common currency, are causing many to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis played little role in the excessive budget deficits of national governments - only in the case of Greece.
Rather, the Eurosystem has stabilized its members' exchange rates in favor of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself in a situation of inherent productivity loss compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce wages and public spending - encouraged by Berlin.
Far deeper than the current budgetary and monetary problems is the European productivity malaise.
As a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - to provide discounts to French and German energy firms on consumer spending - European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United Nations.
This is the crippling cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even a freeze on all wages in the world cannot save the European petrochemical industry from being hit by cheap US shale gas.
The result is a spirit of revolt among the people, especially in France, which was once a major supporter of the EU.
After the war, France 's top politicians saw the EU as a way to keep Germany in check and provide Paris with the world 's equivalent of Washington 's billing.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, which have shaken the French economy.
Results: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has won a landslide victory in the recent by-election, pushing the ruling Socialists into third place.
The Front is currently the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they cannot go along with the assumption that disruption for the left will automatically benefit the right.
What is Peine doing with his newfound fame among the French working - class, white people?
The party wants to use next year's EU elections to create an anti - EU, pan - monetary anti - monetary faction in the European Parliament.
If, as is very likely, the anti - EU parties do well in these elections, such a faction could influence the European Parliament for the first time.
My view is this: Soon the combination of anti - EU and anti - monetary sentiment in Europe will end the euro.
The euro will not be completely abolished, but it will return in some form, in the form of a "Europe of sovereign nations" backed by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I expect the UK to keep itself out of this project in the hope of drawing closer to the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all of this?
We can choose to remain the territory of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to secede at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in a loose European system, provided we have our own currency.
It will be easier for non-EU nations to work together with other like - minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise we should consider maintaining our economic independence by following the Norwegian path.
The SNP government in Scotland has - remarkably - been the most successful anti - austerity political campaign in Europe, winning a surprising majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory - Lib Dems coalition.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, as it would then have to accept the austerity rules imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Premature puberty: The early stages of growth
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty earlier than white girls their age.
Physical changes do not necessarily indicate that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemicals are to blame
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be a cause of precocious puberty
Premature puberty is less effective in boys
Pat Etheridge, a former CNN correspondent, is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter begins to develop breasts and develop genital hair at the age of 7 or 8?
Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pediatric endocrinologist, explained at the American Academy of Pediatrics annual conference in Orlando, Florida this week that these early physical changes are common in American girls, they are the new trend.
"I spend a lot of time trying to reassure parents", says Kaplowitz, "that this does not usually indicate rapid progress toward full puberty".
Direct signs of development such as breast germination, genital and pubic hair and body odor are seen early in girls.
But in the last four decades there has been a very slight change in the age of Rajosadr (first menstrual - dharma).
In the United States, the average age is 12. 5 years, which was 12. 75 in the year 1970.
"It takes at least two to three years for the first menopause to occur when the breasts begin to develop", explains Kaplowitz, author of "Premature Puberty in Girls: A Necessary Guide to Dealing with This Common Problem".
The most accurate test of puberty is the time of development.
There is debate about what marks the beginning of puberty, but when the breast grows with development before the age of eight, two call it "child-adulthood".
In most cases this process will slow down or stop - which can be closely monitored by the paediatrician.
In cases of more rapid progression, examination by an endocrinologist may be required to rule out the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay premature menstruation and other consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can cause underdeveloped growth and sluggish height as an adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy depend on the age of the child, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
The psychological aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is aware of the drug problem but admits, "Duping adolescence can lead to increased behavioral issues, and girls may start to feel isolated from their peers".
The second major problem can be understood: Parents simply do not want their young daughters to have periods.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will keep clean", said Caplowitz.
One woman, whose daughter had her first period at the age of 10, recalls, "It was a shock.
Although there were signs of this and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She returned from school feeling frightened and upset that she was the first of her classmates to have started menstruating.
There are many popular theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence to suggest that sex - oriented messages can be blamed on hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or media.
Boys too - like girls - are reaching premature puberty.
Caplovitz rules that the most important cause is the outbreak of obesity.
She helped conduct a study in 2001 on girls aged 6 to 9 that linked body fat to the time of puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African - American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls their own age.
There are many explanations.
Globally, patterns of premature puberty seem to be affected by everything from economic conditions to weather to genes.
Other puzzles: Although boys are acquiring facial and genital hair at a young age, the full course of puberty is not as evident as in girls.
Other physicians present at the A. A. P. conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see moustache and genital hair.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty", says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goreybe Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician on how to talk to their children.
"It may mean communicating before the expected time", advises Caplowitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be reassured that even if it is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.
The temperature on Virwar was recorded as 3.1 degrees Celsius.
The rain and cold winds on Wednesday night made people feel very cold.
On the day of Veerwar, people wore sweaters and went to the markets and their destinations.
People have taken out their rak's when the first winter rains come.
In the morning, people were also seen enjoying the sunshine.
The change of weather would also provide relief from illness, such as colds, etc. But after that, the rain continued to fall due to the clouds that covered the area for the day.
The children also went to their school wearing sweaters.
The maximum temperature on Friday was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius, according to the Air Force Meteorological Department.
While 7. 8 mm of rain was recorded.
The weather forecast is for cloudy skies.
With the controversy over seat width, large orders from jet manufacturers are at stake.
Setting the pace for the fight for this month's Dubai Airshow, a race has started among leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-haul flights.
The controversy centers on the width of economy class seats on long-haul flights, not always as offered by airlines, but whose allocated space efficiency is claimed by the latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing company to be key.
Airbus expects to set an industry standard of at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide seats in the economy cabin this week, but that should be decided by the airline, its main rival Boeing says.
The dispute between the aircraft manufacturers comes when the possible orders placed after the 17 - 21 incident involved the sale of the larger twin - engine version of the long - range aircraft.
How is the design of the aircraft's rear - particularly whether the seating is 9 or 10 being designed to accommodate the demands of the larger capacity of the mini jumbo jets?
Boeing says it has created a "777 X" that will hold 406 people in a 17-inch wide, 10-person, single-seat compartment.
Airbus says it will carry 350 people in seats 18 inches by 9 inches, competing with the A350.
The aircraft giants often attack the business on technical matters through advertisements in the business press.
Now, with the Airbus 777 X, Dubai is expected to dominate over 100 orders at the Airshow, further appealing to the public.
Recently, it has been shown that the beginning of the War of Independence is taking place, and this is what Finucero is showing us, the three of us together in a restaurant.
"Boeing is also offering long-haul flights in narrow seats with regional turbo", said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
As a result of the change, people may be getting bigger, but the way they sit on the plane has not changed.
According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, between the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 Jumbo defined the modern long-haul flight, and the turn of the century, the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 gained 10 percent more weight.
According to the U.S. Health Statistics, the average American male in the 21st century has a waist of 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to the 1950s single-seat concept when the new name "jet set" was narrow in average circumference.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission to suggest an extra inch in seat width could improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputed Airbus' seat measurement data, and said it was not up to the manufacturers to decide how the airlines balance the fare and the amenities.
Also, research shows that the width of a seat depends more on the experience of the cabin.
"It really speaks to the flexibility that airlines have and the things that they believe they need to do to succeed", said Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
" They won't tell us what they're getting out of it".
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers it is about elbow room, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that it can affect income.
The trade behind this dispute is estimated to be at least $ 700 billion, enough to tip the balance of American and European exports in the coming decades.
Reuters reported for the first time in July that seat layout is actually a contentious issue among new jetliners.
Airbus and Boeing claimed 20 percent efficiency per seat in their new twin engine design compared to the segment leader, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's performance claim relies on the comparison of the 10 x 777 with the original 9 x 777 design.
The comparison with the unit cost of profit is now 10.
Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger facilities for Europe says "Boeing is doing this to make their aircraft more competitive with our products, to occupy more seats".
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-row cabin for the current 777 S suggests that many passengers favor the dense layout, which can also go along with the cheaper fare.
Cabin insider Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network said, "The eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is powered by the threat of the 777".
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list of suppliers for airlines to choose from.
Jet sellers around the world should also take the precaution of checking on this layout competition.
To make it more comfortable, all the builders are also offering high density layouts for low cost airlines and regional travel of jet aircraft.
Airbus is giving away a 10 A350 but say it 's not sold yet.
But until recently, Airbus has insisted on wider cabin seats on some of its jets for the need of more cabin comfort.
Modern jets are unlikely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but this could divert the 777 X from the sales wave.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may end the enjoyment of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could eliminate the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from lifelong nicotine addiction.
Further testing is needed before human trials can be initiated, which could take several years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the initial signs are positive.
Professor Cornell said that "we are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can eventually help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods available in the market today, but found that their nicotine addiction is far more powerful than these methods".
The vaccine contains a harmless virus, engineered to deliver genetic information for the purpose of creating new anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to make a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood and stop the smoker from craving nicotine by neutralizing them before they reach the brain.
In the trial, mice given the vaccine and later given nicotine continued to perform their normal activities.
But the rat that was not vaccinated "felt good", the researchers say, a sign that nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The first tobacco vaccines failed because they had antibodies.
He had to be dosed at regular intervals to maintain antibody levels, but that proved expensive and impractical.
But the new vaccine is expected to be expensive, as the liver will turn the cell into a factory for antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the human vaccine of the future is completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try cigarettes, thus preventing them from becoming addicted to nicotine.
But it is likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They will find that if they start smoking again, they will not get any pleasure from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them to quit", he said.
British scientists called the results interesting, but warned that much more research was needed.
Even after the postmortem, the real cause of death of the tiger could not be revealed.
The Forest Department is giving a round - edged response, saying that the death of the tiger was natural.
On Thursday night, forest workers of Ramnagar Forest Division found the body of a tiger near the Khichdi drainage of Pavalgarh Conservation Reserve.
All the parts of the body of the tiger were safe and there were no wounds or injuries.
On Friday, the postmortem of the tiger was conducted by the Vets of CTR Bharat and Hema Rathore of Kottabagh in the presence of the Forest Conservator Vivek Pandey, Deputy Director of CTR Saket Badola, DFO Kahakasha Naseem, SDO GS Karki.
According to sources, the internal body of the tiger was said to be damaged during the postmortem.
This did not reveal the actual cause of death of the tiger.
The departmental officials kept replying with a round of applause.
However, the IVRI has been sent to Bareilly for the topical examination to confirm the poisoning of the internal organs of the tiger.
The tiger 's death was considered natural by the forest conservationist Western Circle Vivek Pandey.
There are no signs of poisoning etc. from the tiger's body.
However, the BISRA has sent the probe to confirm the poisoning, while the surrounding area has been searched.
We deny being affected by Tripod Obide.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the State Corruption Watchdog.
NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripody has refused to deny the policy of maritime leases on the islands at the request of his political mentor, former New South Wales Conservative MP Eddie Obaid, who had hidden interests in the three former government - controlled lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed an investigation into whether Mr Obaid lobbied several state ministers for violations of lease policy circulars where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obaid were renewed without tender after their term expired in August 2005.
The allegation that Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obaid' s hidden interests is now being investigated after evidence given by Mr Lin Ashpole, former Deputy Chief of Staff, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressed for the introduction of public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009 the Circular's enterprises for leases, from which Obide earned $ 250 million a year, were renewed without lease tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tenders.
But he refused to change the request of Mr. Obaid, who had urged a change in the government lease policy.
A transcript of the phone calls made to Mr Obaid and Mr Tripodi at ICAC in August and September 2007 and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to Mr Obaid 's Fisheries Department after working at the Ministry of Ports
Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi. "What was the commercial lease policy development case being discussed in the telephone conversation?"
"No", answered Mr. Tripodi.
I cannot recall what was discussed, but it was certainly not that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obaid.
Authorities say Israeli fighter jets have been raided in Syria.
Israeli fighter jets targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia late Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News.
The officer did not say what the motive was, but there must have been at least one motive.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian SA-125 missile.
Israel has already launched airstrikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign employees on the 457 visa can pass the "authenticity" test
A "validity" test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the government, as it aims to extend a stringent procedure.
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a standard aimed at preventing 457s being used in Australia to fill unskilled positions or to be disguised as being delivered to family and friends.
A government discussion paper was released today, condemning the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, with former Labor MP Maxine McCue today saying it could anger Australia's neighbouring countries.
"Foreigners are coming to the end of the line" and the rhetoric about "Aussies first" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions have been calling for a safe labour market, he told the America India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected - and I wouldn't be surprised if some in the field have seen the echo of that historical evidence.
The letter outlines 12 measures that were first considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday where he met officials about people smugglers, has implemented five of the proposed changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant may be examined as to "whether the enrolment is genuine in circumstances where the enrolled person is a relative or personal partner of the employer or the relevant person of the person sponsoring the visa".
Businesses may need to keep track of the number of 457 visa holders, as earlier businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees employed hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man 's troubled nine - year - old son had come with him on a trip to Australia, and after his father 's death on Wednesday, an adult cousin of his, who was on the same ship, has tied the knot.
Australian authorities transported the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study has been announced by the UK Government to increase Scotland's benefits from the HS2 rail project.
Work by HS2 points to high speed services in Scotland and the north of England, which will begin soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Cramer said the project would "unite Britain".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to be working with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will involve a new high speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
On completion of the second phase, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government revised the cost of building a high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, in consultation with Scottish Transport, instructed HS2 Ltd to consider the possibilities of further improving rail capacity and travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Kramer: "Our aim for HS2 is a genuine national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer together".
We are moving forward with HS2, because the benefits will be huge.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be better connected because of HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland".
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr Carmichael for Scotland's "clear" return to the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it will also add to the economic burden on Scotland in the whole of the UK in terms of high speed rail.
We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to explore options to bring high-speed rail to Scotland, create benefits for all and deliver the Glasgow - Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the inquiry report with British Government Ministers next year and to taking decisions together on further action.
Aircraft electrical equipment regulations will remain in force in Australia
Despite the easing of equipment regulations in the US, Australian airline passengers will continue to have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during boarding and landing.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the option open for US airline operators to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight, provided they are in "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can do this during many flights, but many people do not like being unable to access their e-books, etc. while taking off and landing.
Australian aircraft operators are considering the decision, which would require US aircraft operators to do much more to meet this requirement, but have indicated that they have no immediate plans to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that Australia still has restrictions on the use of electrical devices during critical phases of flight.
"Currently CASA has no specific regulation governing the use of electrical equipment on aircraft", the authority said, "this issue falls under the regulations that require airline operating companies to ensure that safety is always maintained, and that passengers must comply with safety instructions given by crew members".
Virgin, which is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change but has asked to take further action on the regulator's instructions.
"We would welcome a review by CASA in the case of allowing the use of electrical devices, as we really feel that it will provide a better experience for customers, as we now have [wireless in-flight entertainment] on our aircraft", the spokesperson said.
Quantas said it will follow the current rules for now.
It said that "according to our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no immediate plans to change this".
FAA decisions apply to US airlines.
Well, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and we will certainly consider the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different for each US airline company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Airline companies will be required to certify that their aircraft can withstand radio interference from mobile devices, and to amend their rule books, training materials, carry-on baggage programmes and briefing to passengers.
The FAA said that "after airlines verify the tolerability of their aircraft, it will allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electrical devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all altitudes".
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off their equipment during landing.
The group also suggested that heavy equipment be safely stored under the seat or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
The silver of pawnbrokers due to the difficulty felt by the middle class in Singapore
In a pawnshop at the Bendemeyer Shopping Centre in Singapore, Janani Amritalinga is taking cash in exchange for her gold bracelets, rings and earrings to pay for her daughter's school fees.
Mrs. Amartlinga said, "My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is tied up in it".
She says that although she earns S$3,000 (US$2,400) as an administrator and her husband also has a job, the family's monthly income is insufficient.
In fact, there is similar demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where domestic debt is rising - ValueMax, where they are doing their business, became the third pawn shop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Jewellery pledging is not the only way to get cash - S$ 1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga - but is almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnbrokers in Singapore charge 17 per cent per annum, which is only slightly higher than the 15. 4 per cent offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and they can provide loans more quickly than a bank.
Millions of people in the region are turning to pawnshops as families face difficulties due to the rising cost of living and the rise in household and consumer debt.
After five years of strong growth following the global financial crisis, and cheap credit due to easy monetary policy in developed economies, low and middle income households are turning to pawnshops to meet their needs due to the slowdown in their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standard & Poor's, cited rising domestic profits, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said that in Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt as a proportion of GDP.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged more or less from the tech recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued export slowdown and consumer demand decline.
Song Seng Won, an economist at Malaysian bank CIMB, said, "The crucial point is that with rising prices, people in the lower middle [income scale] will try to increase their income in every possible way".
Historically high prices in gold prices over the past two years have prompted people to mortgage personal assets as they take advantage of the opportunity to redeem the value of their family jewellery.
In Singapore, 70 percent of the goods pledged in the 200 pawn outlets of the city-state are gold.
People are saying "The gold looks good, let's pawn the gold chain of grandmother, and we will take it back next month.
EasyMoney, Thailand's largest pawnshop operator, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlet in recent months.
The mortgage business has grown so much that Valumex, the outlet operator in Bendimir and 15 others like it in Singapore, are planning to expand not only in their neighborhood, Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Valumex executive director Ya Li Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars received in this week's listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While the high interest rates have led to criticism of some discount lenders, Ms. Yagh says that pledging not only gets a cheaper rate than other lenders, but it does not directly increase the loan.
"Customers mortgage items they already own, and the repayment of personal assets does not increase household debt", she says.
The social acceptance of pawnbroking for securing short term financial assistance is increasing.
It is not that pawnbrokers are used only by the financially weak.
In Singapore, the rich also use the ValueMax outlet, mortgaging gold bars or Rolex watches for up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
We have customers from all walks of life.
"These include wealthy individuals who need short term loans for business ventures or investments, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow needs", Ms. Jah says.
Sometimes they need money in a very short time.
India's biggest businessman Mukesh Ambani's wife Nita Ambani is celebrating her 50th birthday on 1 November 2013.
Neeta is celebrating her birthday in Jodhpur, not Mumbai.
He organized a huge party on this occasion.
Many big Bollywood stars arrived in Jodhpur to attend the party. Late in the evening of October 31, several big stars were seen catching flights to Jodhpur at Mumbai Airport.
The stars include Karishma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose and others.
Obviously, you can imagine how big the celebration will be when such big names join the party.
$ 325 million rescue package for the health of Taji
The Union government has insisted that the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system comes with strict conditions that will ensure that the state government cannot squander the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibresek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to address the current crisis caused by the island state's aging population, high rates of chronic diseases, and system limitations.
The decision to fund the project over four years was made after consultation with the government and independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
Ms. Pliberecek said today, "The government has brought an emergency rescue package which we believe will address the particular challenges facing the state.
The $325 million package also includes an alternative surgery plan of $31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving the previous accumulated cases.
This includes funding for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved after-hospital care, training of medical specialists, mental health services and introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the best practices I have been told by leading physicians to improve Tasmania's health system", Ms Plibbersek said.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government would face strict reporting and accountability governance.
The State must maintain the current funding level to receive Commonwealth funds, and report each month where the additional funds are being spent.
A three member Commission will be constituted to ensure that the State provides the service in the most effective and efficient manner.
Mr Wilkie said that the $325 million would not mean much "unless real reforms are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more sustainable level".
Nevertheless, he appreciated the Government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought to the Prime Minister in early May".
"I hope that the federal aid package will be very helpful in the direction of removing the public health system from the distress list", said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the State Government, these additional alternative processes will essentially undo the recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "a band-aid solution".
told ABC TV, "We are here because the Labor State government has taken $430 million from their health system.
You cannot regard the state government taking nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth giving 300 million dollars as a good news day.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibresek should guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel has excellent production design and timing, but it has gone beyond what it should have been.
Set in France in 1760, the novel tells the tragic story of a young noble named Suzanne, who is sent to a convent by a member of her family.
When she rebels she is subjected to the extreme cruelty of the voluntary persecutor, the Mother Superior, and becomes the object of erotic attraction for the other.
This film never goes into sexuality or sensationalism - and that is the problem.
The seriousness of the plot also risks making it a boring film for the audience.
Dr. Munna Singh, Vice Chancellor, CSA has decided to charge admission fee to the garden due to the dirt spread in the garden.
The department has been given a 15-day ultimatum to rectify the situation.
The Vice Chancellor made an inspection of the Deputy Director Seed and Field and Director Research with the Horticulture Department at 10 am on Friday.
He found more than a dozen employees, including the director, in their seats.
After reprimand, he threatened to cut his wages if he was found absent again.
Dr. Naushad Khan, the university's media officer, said that a month-long tour will be conducted for Rs.
For a fee of one rupee per day, people will be able to go and walk in the garden.
System will work: The files coming before the Vice Chancellor related to various tasks will reach under one system.
Not every employee will have the right to take his file and enter the VC office.
The concerned officers will convey them to the final Vice Chancellor.
Monitoring group says Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing capability
The monitoring group said on Thursday that Syria had destroyed equipment critical for making chemical weapons and poison gas warfare materials, while fierce fighting erupted in northern Syria, which is very close to where the toxic agents are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Movement group said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the Syrian civil war began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons comes a day ahead of the November 1 deadline.
The Hague - based organisation had ordered Damascus to destroy or "decommission" all chemical weapons production units and machinery used to mix chemicals in poisonous gases and fill them with war materials.
The completion of the initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in this ambitious development which aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
Destroying the equipment means that Syria can no longer develop new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the weapons and collections it possesses.
Syria is believed to have 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the announcement came as fighting escalated on Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts believe is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as a storage facility.
The Movement Group, which keeps records of the death toll through the network of the movement in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
It has said that this includes 61,067 common citizens, including 6,365 children.
The government says 29,954 are members of President Bashar al-Assad's military forces, 18,678 are fighters fighting on the government's side and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said that among the dead were 2,202 army deserters and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that about 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
As a result of the conflict, about two million people have been forced to leave the country.
Assad's military contingent fought for several weeks in Saffira against rebels, many of whom were affiliated with al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said there were casualties on both sides, but did not say anything explicitly.
The war illustrates the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in a very short timeframe.
The statement on behalf of the OPCW, which is working with the United Nations, said its team was "satisfied and has just confirmed - and seen - all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/fill equipment destroyed".
It also said, "No further inspection activity is being planned".
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first phase of verification work at 21 of the 23 centres declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit the two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, the OPCW said that the two sites "have been abandoned and... chemical weapons products stored there have been moved to other declared sites that have been inspected".
It was not immediately clear whether the unit at Safira was one of the two centres where OPCW inspectors were unable to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
In a comment issued by the OPCW, Director General of the Monitoring Group, Ahmet Uzumcu said, "I salute the tenacity and courage shown by you in completing the most challenging mission undertaken by this organisation to date".
The three - year - long civil war is mainly between the Assad government and its security forces, which include members of the Alawite sect, which has branched off from Shia Islam, and the rebellious Sunni Muslims.
In another development, the head of the observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, said that a powerful explosion occurred on Wednesday at the air defence centre in the Syrian coastal region of Latakia.
He said that the cause of the explosion is not yet known.
The police have recovered fake registry, fake seals, laptop and photocopies of the fake registry from the possession of the accused.
The Moti Nagar Police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the accused arrested include Rajiv Agarwal aka Bintu of Chandra Nagar, Habowal, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohada and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office (Eastern) has absconded from the scene.
According to the police, the accused, along with the clerk and record keeper of the Registrar 's office Balbir Singh, used to extract papers from the records of vacant and old land and then buy new stamp paper and prepare a forged registry on them.
After that, the real registry would be lost and the fake registry would be added to the record.
After this, the accused used to sell the land for crores of rupees on forged papers.
At the same time, they took loans on these forged papers.
After this, the real owner of the land was subject to the police and the administration.
The accused who had the fake registry prepared had a special eye on the land of the NRIG.
Because there is no one to look after the land of the NRIG.
So it is easy to create fake land registries and sell them.
Police Commissioner Gill said that the accused had told in interrogation that they had prepared about 150 fake registrations so far.
According to the police, Rajeev, the gang's ringleader, has previously been charged with fraud and theft.
Anger over conviction of Bali bomb plotter
Relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 bomb blasts, outraged by the punishment given to the bomb plotter, said that Omar Patek should face the firing squad.
Patek, who had been on the run for nearly 10 years as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years for his role in the construction of the explosive device used in the bombing.
He can be released in 15 years if given parole.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many more.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings in churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, although they could have asked for the death penalty for the so-called "democratic individual" who was notorious as the mastermind of the bomb.
The decision rekindled the painful memories of June Courtney, a Perth woman who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
He stopped his aspersions and said that Patek should have been executed.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other cowardly terrorists.
"He should be brought before the firing squad", Ms. Courtenay told AAP.
I have to live without my grandchildren and my daughters every day.
The club was obliterated on October 12, 2002 just after 11 pm, after a bomb loaded in a van parked outside the club exploded.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when the suicide bomber detonated the bag full of explosives just 20 seconds before.
He went into a month - long coma as a result of the bombing and "died" three times while on life - support equipment.
Mr Hughes says Patek should have received the same punishment that three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist group responsible for the massacre - Amarozi, Mukhallas and Imam Samudra - received four years earlier.
In fact, this person should be executed before anyone else.
To keep him alive, see, there is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless others, 20 years is not enough.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be sentenced.
He evaded capture for nearly a decade, but was finally captured in January 2011, in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where U.S. forces killed former al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent presented evidence that the report revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to reestablish contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al Qaeda.
"He did not surrender", says Ms. Courteen.
Even today, he is not really the one who has caused so much mental pain to so many people.
The decision comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
Miss Courtine said, "There will be many tears this year".
Patek can still appeal against his punishment.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on the plane (but not cell phones)
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music from gate entry to gate exit - but not to talk to their cellphones - under highly anticipated new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But the passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference that how quickly these changes are implemented will vary from airline to airline.
Airlines will have to show to the FAA how their aircraft are complying with the new guidelines and how they are updating their crew training manuals and device collection regulations to reflect the guidelines.
The FAA has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on board aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
"Based on the status of the project, we may very soon be able to approve extended use of the electronic device", the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to lock their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the gate is closed.
They are expected to not turn on the aircraft until they reach 10,000 feet and are given permission by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices when the aircraft is landing, and not to turn them on until the aircraft has fully landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully protected from electronic disruption can allow their passengers to use the device during take-off, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airlines and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
The changes have been welcomed by Laura Gladding, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants.
"When the policy is safely implemented - and we will work with airlines to do that - it will be a win-win for both sides", Glading said in a statement.
We are tired of feeling like "hall monitors" when it comes to this issue.
However, surfing, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data by connecting to the Internet at altitudes below 10,000 feet will still be prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there's still no interaction with friends, an online game like Scrabble, which led to the famous incident in 2011 when actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while the plane was parked at the gate, and American Airlines had to take him off the plane when he refused to turn off the device.
Heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be stored as there is a risk of injury to another person in the cabin if they are thrown.
Cell phone calls will also continue to be prohibited during the flight.
The Federal Communications Commission has the regulatory authority over phone calls, not the FAA.
The FAA may remove restrictions on certain electronic devices during take - off and landing of aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rosenkan of the National Transportation Safety Board, who is a national transportation safety expert for CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are a really serious issue, not only because they potentially disrupt navigation-related devices, but also because they can disrupt cell phone towers when they are in the air", said Roenker.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue recommended last month that the government should allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure has been mounting in recent years on the FAA to relax restrictions on their use.
Sen. Claire McCaskill, a D-Mo critic, has said there is no valid security reason for the ban.
These restrictions are becoming more difficult to enforce because of the ubiquity of the device.
Some studies also indicate that about one-third of travelers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAA started restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 after reports of disruption in navigation and communication equipment due to passengers carrying FM radios and other high-tech gadgets of the time.
The new airlines are more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi access at cruising altitude for several years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
Most of the airlines should meet the eligibility criteria for increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huarta said.
Today's electronic devices emit radio transmissions of much less power than the previous generation of electronic devices.
For example, e - readers, the transmission is quite nominal when the page is turned.
But the transmission is stronger when the data is downloaded or sent by the device.
Amazon.com was among those who favored easing restrictions on passenger use of the device.
In 2011, company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers into airlines and flew them to test for problems, but found none.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks posed by the use of the device.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believes the disruption from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only reports narrated by pilots in support of the aircraft systems being disrupted by the device, most of which were very old.
However, the Committee members recommended that the FAA allow the pilot to order the passengers to turn off the device when the aircraft is landing in low visibility.
The travel industry group has welcomed the changes and called them the common sense feature of people travelling in the latest era of technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a passenger traveling with pleasure is not incompatible with safety and security", said Roger Doe, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Taking a lesson from the serial bomb blasts in Patna, the UT Police has been equipped for quick reaction in Diwali celebrations and emergencies in view of security.
A total of 1800 soldiers will be on foot and vehicle patrol at all the major landmarks, crowded markets and other places in the city to ensure smooth flow of traffic, prevent rush accidents, and to punish those who commit other crimes including teaching lessons to the movers.
The contingent will include women police personnel including PCR, Traffic Unit.
Police personnel and commandos will also conduct vigilant duty record checks at hotels, guest houses and other places including PGs in the city.
The police have directed the SHO to constitute a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the cases.
The DSPs, including the Inspector, are also entrusted with the responsibility of inspecting the VIP Sectors, markets, malls and other places in the city.
In view of the emergency situation and the festival of Diwali, the High Commissioners have also scheduled additional police personnel for duty in police control in view of the convenience of the people.
The Police Fire Department and the staff of the dispensaries, including the Director, Principal Director and DHS of PGI, besides the management of Sector-16 GMSH and Sector-32 GMCH, were asked to remain on high alert in times of emergency.
To teach the mobsters a lesson, the departmental officials have now called the 'anti gangsta staff' on duty under the leadership of the NGO, including the women police personnel.
Police personnel of the Anti Gangsta Staff Team will be dressed in plain clothes and will be stationed in crowded places including markets to arrest the mob.
On Diwali, all SHOs have been ordered to install 44 Naks in inner city areas.
Police personnel will also be on standby at 38 checkpoints along the city boundaries.
The bird was airlifted back to the wild for safety from the North Sea Rig.
The bird, found nesting on the North Sea Oil Rig, has been released back into the wild from the coast by air transport.
The bird, known as the Water Rail, was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen before being brought back to his rescue centre in Aloe by the Scottish SPCA.
"This water rail was probably a wintering migratory bird from northern Europe, caught in strong winds over the North Sea", explains Colin Seddon, the center's manager.
The bird was apparently exhausted and took refuge on the oil rig.
He added: "It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help".
The water rail was restored to health and fitness before being released.
Is the European upper class ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April and pledged to bring business together and determine what changes the UK's job and prosperity makers would like to see in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them what they thought of UK business with the EU.
U-Gov surveyed 1,000 business leaders representing UK business sizes, sectors and locations.
The findings of this survey may come as a surprise to many.
We found that a large proportion of businessmen now want to export outside Europe, and to focus on those countries which are modernizing and growing, while the E. U. member countries are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritise new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than engage in the long and costly process of reforming the EU 's shadowy institutions.
When asked for their views on specific policy areas ranging from monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that control of these decisive competencies should return to Westminster.
The general discontent with the single market was easily seen, with businessmen saying that the cost of Brussels regulation far outweighs the benefits of being part of Europe 's trading zone - even the giants who traditionally favored European companies, 40 per cent, agreed.
Finally, and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that a large proportion clearly want Britain to move towards a trade-based relationship and treaty change with the EU rather than politics.
This finding, which was seen at the levels of the major business groups, showed that business was moving towards a "meaningful change" that would give the UK back its lost power.
It comes at a high price - the issue of treaty change and getting a better deal for Britain, in the poll, shifted 16 percent of the vote in favor of remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that UK business people support his plan to negotiate the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect a renegotiation of the current balance of power to bring about a meaningful change in the UK' s favour.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and is becoming increasingly imperative, as the eurozone moves towards a closed economy and fiscal union.
The UK must prioritise jobs and growth, as our survey findings show that for business it means a new focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom described the beginning of a new era of pipelines in Bulgaria
The Head of Gazprom said that the start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of Europe's largest energy projects.
"Today marks a historic event: construction has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large-scale and important project in Europe", said Alexy Miller, president of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream will diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A dispute over the contract between Gazprom's counterpart in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is destined for Europe, and Gazprom presents a risk to traditional routes, officials said.
A direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, would mean the end "forever" of the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries, Miller said.
After the full project is operational in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas from South Stream at reduced rates.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

The Royal Commission heard allegations of sexual offences against two YMCA employees before the charges against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA NSW employees have been charged with child sex offences, before charges were brought against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011.
But in its statement before the Commission, it said that it had "never reported any cases of child sexual abuse within its organisation", the Commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which a Y.M.C.A. employee was charged with child pornography offences and another case in which a Y.M.C.A. caring gym instructor was charged with child sex offences against children in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told the Commission 's assisting counsel, Gail Farnes, that he was aware of the first case, but not the second.
He also admitted that the statement of Y.M.C.A. before the Commission that "Y.M.C.A. has been subjected to external investigation and found Y.M.C.A. to be the foremost in child safety" is also inaccurate.
The Commission has evidence that YMCA was notified and received the second lowest rating out of four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who has been associated with the Y.M.C.A. for 21 years, admitted that appointing Lord had failed the "self including me" management, and failed to ensure that staff were clearly aware of their obligations in relation to reporting child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 children during his two-year tenure at YMCA.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that there was a cultural problem at the YMCA that caused staff to fail to report the child safety violation by Lord.
The staff gave evidence of what they saw as violations, including Lorde spending time alone with the children, babysitting them in private, sitting them in the lap, telling them he loved them and letting them play on his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lorde' s supervision and had asked for child safety training because she was concerned about her behaviour, testified that Y.M.C.A. Caringbah Child Services Manager Jacqui Bernat, who was supervising Lorde, was "very intimidating and difficult to find most of the time".
The CEO said he did not accept the evidence from the employees that they were not comfortable giving information above their manager.
He said that his friendship with the Lord had rather misled his decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had provided the YMCA NSW congregation with his view that the lesson for the organization from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "about not giving information".
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have the confidentiality agreement signed by the staff immediately after the allegations came to light was made by Liam Whiteley, the Y. M. C. A. general manager of children 's services.
He said that the aim was to avoid confusion of evidence, but it was "overzealous" and not executed properly.
Stephen Smalbone, Professor of Child Sexual Abuse at Griffith University, said that the YMCA was not a safe organisation during Jonathan Lord's tenure between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruitment, screening, admission, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing has been adjourned till 20th December.
Blair says they want the UK back
Tony Blair said he would like the chance to become Britain's Prime Minister again - but he believes there is no chance of a return.
In the interview, taken in the evening on the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, the 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr Blair largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to his role as a representative of the foreign affairs and Middle East peace-keeping group.
Asked whether he would like to return to the prime minister's office, Mr Blair was quoted by London's Evening Standard newspaper as saying: "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely, so"...
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community in the wake of the financial crisis.
When the crowds of expert show horses gathered for the best horse of the year in Cardiff, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for three - year - old Fenton Kirkland.
A few months away from taking his first step, this toddler and his pet, Taffy the Shetland Pug, easily completed three steps and won the top prize - beating out 30 of his adult competitors.
The inextricable pair - who are only 6' 2′′ tall - were highly praised for their looks, behaviour and style at the annual competition organised by the Sunnyback Equestrian Centre at Rowdry, near Cardiff.
In front of the men and women in beautiful bowler hats, he tilted his flat cap at an angled angle and circled his two - year - old toffee around the ring.
The judges praised Fenton for his natural ability to control, which is far ahead of his age.
And Toffy got the highest marks for her looks and personality.
Fenton was given the toffee as a present for his third birthday last March, and he has been practising with the Shetland pony every day since.
"Fenton and Toffy are a great couple", said his 30-year-old mother, Donna.
They had to face the challenge from all the candidates, but they both won the Gold Cup and the Rosetta.
This was only the second time that she had entered a competition with the Toffey, and we are all very happy with her victory.
The most unique in this arena, he was so amazing that everyone wanted to take a picture with him.
This little boy from the village of Nantyglow, near Abwell, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells who has been exhibiting horses for over 10 years.
Mr. Howells said: "The whole place was filled with excitement, and everyone was celebrating and clapping".
He was running across the sands of the arena, and despite his small size, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is a lover of animals - he loves horses, tractors and the farm, and he has two chickens to look after.
The way he has started, he will be in the best horse show of the year very early on - and I am sure he will do very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to control his pony".
They make a great couple.
The judges scored Fenton and Toffy on the way they performed and on the way they presented themselves in the show ring.
He saw good teamwork between the Pony and his rider - in this case Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fenton's pretty clothes helped him, he was really looking very different.
The Chinese newspaper complaining would be "a waste of money".
A Chinese newspaper that had appealed on its front page for the release of a reporter convicted of defamation will be reinstated, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou newspaper New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr Chen later admitted on television that he had taken a bribe to write a fictitious story about a company partly owned by the state.
The regulator said that the New Express now has to undergo a "complete overhaul".
The order for "reform" came from the Guangdong Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of the Yangcheng Evening News Group had published a number of false stories about the listed company Zumloyen in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "the editorial management of the New Express was disorganized".
It said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty by revoking the reporter's license of Chen Yongzhou".
It "directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a complete reform of the New Express, recommended that the New Express investigate those responsible for it and immediately revise the leadership of the New Express".
Mr. Chen wrote many articles in the New Express blaming financial irregularities in a construction - equipment company called ZoomLyon.
After his expulsion, his newspaper published two front page appeals for his release, and said it supported Mr. Chen 's journalism.
But then Mr. Chen went on state television and admitted to writing and publishing false stories for money.
"In this case, I have damaged Joomla, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the trust of the public", he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have come to realize my mistakes.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a front - page apology, saying it had failed to properly investigate his report.
Many high profile suspects have recently made TV broadcast confessions.
Experts say that forced confessions are made from time to time, despite a law passed later this year that forbids officials from forcing a person to plead guilty.
Shri Hanuman Chalisa will be recited by the National Chairman of the Anti-Terrorism Front, Manindrajit Singh Bitta along with 10 thousand children at the Shri Hanuman Chalisa recitation to be held on 23rd November at Dana Mandi near Jalandhar bypass on behalf of Shri Hindu Justice Bench.
This information was given by Bitta to the gathering after he was invited to recite Hanuman Chalisa on behalf of Shri Hindu Justice Peeth Chief Spokesman Praveen Dung and Ashwani Katyal, Bhupinder Banga, Surjit Jain, Bunty Bajaj, Raman Khosla, Bantu and Anil Sharma.
He appreciated the efforts of the Shri Hindu Justice Bench to connect children with the Sanatan culture.

U. S. - Mexico drug tunnel finds its own railroad
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U. S. officials have described the four - foot - by - three - foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret passageways ever discovered.
The tunnel is roughly the length of six football pitches, connecting a warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U. S. A.
This area is full of uniform warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the trucks being loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was sealed before any drugs could pass through, officials said.
According to court records, authorities have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel discovery.
Three men, who officials said were acting as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
If convicted, they can be sentenced to prison terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers take advantage of the vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major roadway to be discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels discovered since the Central Mexican marijuana crop in October present a formidable challenge to drug mafia groups on how to get the product to consumers faster.
In 2010, authorities found nearly 700 yards of track equipped with rail, stretching from a Tijuana home's foundry to San Diego warehouses.
The Congress candidate Sarhul Ram Bhagat has filed nomination for the assembly constituency.

British police sent Assange an extradition notice
British police sent an extradition notice today to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent a "surrender notice" to the 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he would have to appear at the police station, adding that failing to do so would be his own responsibility for the arrest.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on sex offence charges, and his options under British law were exhausted when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing Stockholm would hand him over to the US, he applied for political asylum in the South American country, seeking asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy in London on 19 June.
A spokesman said Scotland Yard had "sent a surrender notice to Mr Assange, 40, requiring him to appear at the police station on a date and time chosen by us".
He is in violation of the terms of his bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the issuance of a police notice.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the anti-privacy website WikiLeaks.
A fine of £1,000 for driving a car at 130 mph with a hot drink between the legs
The driver has been fined £1,000 for driving at 130 mph (210 km/ h) with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Tiptree on 27 May.
When the police stopped them, they found takeaway drinks at their feet.
In Colchester Magistrates Court, Howie has pleaded guilty to careless driving.
Seven points were added to his licence, resulting in him being banned from driving for six months.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fine of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
The tax on foreign property owners would end London 's artificial status.
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measures, but awaits final action from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced stamp duty at 7 per cent for houses worth over £ 2 million, and for those who prefer to keep a house in a company rather than an individual.
Stamp duty on residential properties in Westminster and the boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea in the tax year 2012/13 was £708 million, which is already more than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber.
Mr Cook said: "After the increase in the stamp duty on high value houses and the introduction of the Associated Anti-avoidance Legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is a lower than appropriate tax on high value property, which has nothing to do with the effect of the outdated council tax system.
He added that "but this move may make some foreign investors hesitant to buy property in London and the current owners reluctant to sell".
Prime property, the top 5 to 10 per cent of the housing market by value in affluent southwest London, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, saw a record 11.8 per cent rise last year.
According to Savills' research, central London prices continued to rise regularly at 5. 6 per cent each year, but the increase appeared to be slightly lower than the "domestic market", as the south - west, north (7. 4 per cent) and east (6. 5 per cent) of the city saw a boom.
Scientists have further elucidated the relationship between the movements of a dog 's tail and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tails more to the right (from the dog 's point of view), while restless dogs move their tails more to the left.
But now scientists say that companion dogs can recognize this subtle variation in tail and respond to it.
The study has been published in the journal Current Biology.
Professor of neuroscience, Georgia Vallertigera, of the University of Trento, explains: "It is well known in humans that the left and right hemispheres of the brain are involved differently in the stimulation that produces positive or negative emotions".
Here we have tried to look at it in other species.
He showed that in dogs, as in humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for the movements of the left hand and the opposite order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the unilateral wagging of their tails by other dogs, researchers watched the animals watching the films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rates of the pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
It will not take us long to understand why his tail sometimes moves to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Wellertigera explained: "We introduced the dogs to the films of the dogs - in realistic versions or in shadow-pictures to deal with other puzzling issues, and we could see the tail move and present the tail more to the left or right".
When the animals saw a dog with its tail tilted to the right (from the dog 's point of view), they remained completely calm.
But when he saw the tail turn in the opposite direction, and turn mainly to the left (again from the dog 's point of view), his heart beat faster and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigra, he does not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these gestures.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from experience which actions they should be concerned about and which ones they should not.
He said: "If you have met other dogs many times, and if they wag their tail constantly to one side, this is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience".
The researchers say these findings could provide owners, veterinarians and trainers with better insights into animal emotions.
John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, an expert in dog behaviour, said this was not the first study to examine whether the left or right side is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they see an aggressive dog and to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another study from the University of Victoria in Canada, they reported: "Unlike the Italian study - when the robot dog's tail was moved to the left rather than the right, the dogs were more likely to approach it rather than become restless".
He said that the difference was because in various studies dogs were not fully understanding animals or robot dogs in films.
He explained that this could be helped by studying how dogs react to real dogs.
"While there is considerable evidence from different mammals that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still to be found - and dogs are no exception", he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it seems that it will probably not take us long to understand why their tail sometimes moves to one side and sometimes to the other.
The Arctic Monkeys postponed the Glasgow gig due to Alex Turner's illness
The Arctic Monkeys rock band has postponed a gig in Glasgow after its lead singer was diagnosed with meningitis.
The Sheffield group were scheduled to perform at the Hydro venue in the city on Friday.
But the illness of their lead singer Alex Turner forced them to reschedule the date of the show.
The band's announcement came as they were forced to similarly cancel a gig at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "After the decision to postpone the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight after medical advice, Arctic Monkeys will also have to postpone the show at the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1".
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis, and is tragically unable to perform".
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November, and the show at Glasgow Hydro will take place on 21 November.
All tickets will be valid for these shows.
We apologize for any inconvenience to all ticket holders.

Pope Francis will announce the first cardinal in February
The Vatican announced Thursday that Pope Francis will create a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals, the highest ranking clergy in the Catholic Church, rank only below the pope, and are the ones who choose the pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his own people who will eventually help choose his successor.
There are 201 cardinals in total.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, cardinals are not allowed to participate in the election of the pope - they fall into the group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony of promoting the new cardinals, a meeting of all the existing cardinals will be held, called the Pontifical Council.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to hold the February Pontifical Council in advance, so as to make it easier to plan other meetings involving cardinals from different countries of the world", Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinal electors was likely to decrease by February.
He said that the Pope, in general, announces the names of the fewer than 120 cardinal electors, as well as those of the more than 80 years old, at his discretion.
Next year's papal conclave will be important, Valero said, because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year.
There is a prejudice against Europe at present, and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope, the cardinals from the rest of the world, are nominated to restore the balance", he said.
In South America, forty percent are Roman Catholics, but the number of cardinals is very small.
They will also be the first cardinals to be elected after Francis has formed the Council of Cardinals - a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose job it is to seek ways to reform the Church.
At first, the Pope decided everything himself.
"Francis has just chosen these eight cardinals to help him", Valero said.
He said it was "possible" that Francis would seek the advice of the cardinals.
But we are not the first in this situation - it is completely new.
Valero said that normally popes give cardinals to bishops of great places, but Francis was "totally surprising - so we don't know who he'll name".
GM recalled pickup trucks in the U. S. to correct seatbacks
General Motors Co. recalled nearly 19,000 trucks to correct a flaw in the hand-rotating seatback in its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks, according to a notice Friday from U.S. auto safety regulators.
Some trucks may have a defect in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, the Union Auto failed to comply with safety standards regarding seatback, head restraints.
According to a notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website, "if the vehicle is stuck from behind, it is possible that the head restraint will not adequately protect the driver, increasing the risk of injury".
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM's trucks began shipping in June and, after the 2009 bankruptcy renewal, this marks the most significant vehicle launch for the top U. S. automaker.
GM notified the truck owners of the defect in late October.
NSTMA could not review the notification letter due to the 16-day government lockdown which had disrupted auto sales growth in October.
GM said on Friday that sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks that were redesigned for the 2014 model year had increased by 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM had sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM 's stock was up 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
The desperate cry of Obama voters
I voted for Obama twice, hoping for change.
He says that Obama's great efforts have been hindered by the GOP's policy of obstruction.
The policy of containment cannot excuse the problems of the Obamacare website, the drone attacks
The Obama 2008 campaign memoir reminds us of what might have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I 'm reading very sad books these days.
It is a book which I feel will encourage me during the turmoil of the second year of medical school and give me a ray of hope.
It's called "The Courage to Win", and it's a memorial to Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I find myself relaxing at night from my patients' prescriptions and going to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could hold your breath.
The election proved to be one - sided, and the news speakers paused to reflect on the historical significance of the moment.
My classmates had tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents saved every newspaper they received.
A group of young visionaries was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
When Obama became president in 2008, he had an 82 percent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The reality of the present is a hard reality, like a return from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope -- they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.
After I voted for the first time, things really changed.
I simply could not have imagined any of it.
I credit Obama for a lot of achievements, from the Affordable Care Act, to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, to the end of "don't ask, don't tell" to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that the policy of partisan protest has held back many of our country's efforts to move forward: including immigration reform, public health care options, closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, and others.
But the number of times I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and colleagues has left me with no answer to give.
I have reached the point of political despair.
The Republican protest policy is not a response to the espionage of foreign leaders, nor is it a response to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the collection of data about the private lives of ordinary American citizens by the national security agency nor to the prosecution of people who expose government wrongdoing.
It cannot explain the murder of US citizen Anwar L. Awlaki without a trial, nor the dwindling public funds and spending limits during the presidential campaign.
It cannot respond to the report's findings, which say that the White House's attempts to silence the media have been "the most aggressive since the Nixon administration".
And most recently, it can't excuse a failure to design a simple website three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.
I don't know if I expected this.
If, at the age of 18, I had anticipated that the regime could defeat the political campaign that brought it forward.
It is clear that elected office is not a predictable route, because opposing political parties and random events like the Newtown massacre will shape our public discourse.
Yet the examples I have given above seem to be largely chosen by the administration itself.
This is what bothers you most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we have been hearing for a long time.
Yet, with Obama's approval rating at less than 45 percent this week, that book has made a return to 2008 very difficult.
I see him and remember his vanished promises.
I was reading a section of the book this week that described how Clinton suffered a huge loss to Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a post - mortuum campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that they needed to get back on track, and remain true to their objectives.
He said, "I want my mojo back".
We must remember who we are.
Today, five years later, Mr President, I could not agree more with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that P.M. Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the paternity leave scheme
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said that the parental leave scheme is a conflict of interest for Prime Minister Tony Abbott because his daughters can get pregnant and take advantage of it.
Mining industry magnate, who is in dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill, has made the claim while trying to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be important in determining whether to reduce carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only ministers can have a conflict of interest, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from the policies.
Mr. Palmer said "that there may be a significant conflict of interest in the issue of paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters become pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not they get leave".
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat in Fairfax by 53 votes after he fell again.
Mr. Palmer called for resumption of the counting of the votes to expedite the process.
Tony Aot's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should the result of the election come two months after we have voted?
He said, "We should have a better system".
Why can't we have a system where we can fill in our report on the computer, vote instantly and have the results at 6:30 p.m.
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencil marks on ballots.
So, because if someone doesn 't like it, we can delete it?
To use a pencil in today 's world seems absurd.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint consultation letter with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his policies included building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he took his new task "very seriously".
Public office is for public service.
He said that "we do not need any other award than the award of history for serving the community at this crucial time".
which caused the plaintiffs problems.
Addressing the gathering, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his deep indignation over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
The rapid increase in attacks on lawyers and their families is evidence that criminals have become fearless, he said.
They have no fear of the police and the administrative system.
Referring to recent incidents in different places, he said that when the advocate community is not safe, the common man can easily be assumed to be safe.
RBS suspends two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people familiar with the matter said, in another sign that the global probe by regulators into suspected currency market manipulation is moving at a fast pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in their investigation of the world's largest financial market, which trades $5.3 trillion every day.
The two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended as the investigation into what appears to be a repeat of the Libor interbank loan manipulation scandal continues.
The bank, while declining to comment on the suspension, has confirmed that the bank has received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago the bank said, "Our investigation into this matter is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators".
Last month, experts in the case said that RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent and received from the former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
The trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been dismissed from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at J. P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramachandani, head of European spot trading in the City, went on holiday last week, while the former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Experts in the field said Mr Usher's instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup.
UBS said it has taken action against some of its employees this week after Swiss regulator FINMA revealed it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's competition authority Veco, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating bankers for allegedly being manipulated to manipulate their favourable movements in the currency market.
People familiar with the matter said that HSBC, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or received requests for information from regulators.
Banks have been closely scrutinizing instant messages and emails for years, looking for clues to wrongdoing.
News of the probe has caused a stir among traders in the sector, who have been among the top earners in the investment banks' trading unit for the past several years, but are facing a challenge this year as the low volatility in currencies has reduced opportunities for speculators to probe.
Some bankers tried to suppress the issue by saying that it was impossible to manipulate the very large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that despite the overwhelming volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own platform by banks means that "you can start to influence the market at a slightly lower ticket price".
The news came on the same day Credit Suisse announced from its Exchange Traded Funds desk in London that the trader was being terminated this week, having lost nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
Credit Suisse said that "we believe the trader acted alone, and that he was manipulated".
Students pursuing other courses including technical and management courses running on campus will be able to exercise their franchise this time.
The university chancellor has written to the Governor for permission to hold the elections.
As the admission process in the university began, the demand for the elections of the students ' union started to rise.
He also launched a signature campaign to select his representative to make his voice heard by the university administration and college management.
Students entering around two dozen courses including BTech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Bioscience, Tourism Management and Paramedical Science run on campus will be able to choose their representatives this year.
More than six thousand students studying here will get a chance to exercise their franchise for the first time.
Vice Chancellor Prof. Ashok Kumar said that the university has sought permission from the Governor to hold the elections.
The date of the election will be announced as soon as the permission is given.
He said it is the responsibility of the college management to conduct elections in other colleges.
Many college management do not want to have student union elections on their campuses.
At the same time, elections are not being held due to lack of unity among students.
The council had launched a petition for the election.
Akash Jaiswal, departmental coordinator ABVP
After Diwali, the district administration will be asked for permission to hold elections in the colleges.
The lack of clarity of the college approach to the union election is also causing problems.
On Dhanteras, people have bought a lot of gold and silver in the capital, from pots to silver.
Such purchases have increased by 20 to 30 per cent compared to the previous year.
The lounges were crowded in the shops of jewellery in Shimla.
The decorating pot shops from Lower Bazaar to Mal Road were also crowded.
Although the year was one of inflation, people were not shy to make purchases on the auspicious occasion.
The auspicious time for shopping on Friday was from 7. 52 to 10. 12 am and from 1. 56 to 3. 37 am and from 6. 17 to 8. 12 am.
During all these three mohurts, more people flocked to the suburbs, including Shimla, for more shopping.
In the Simla Lower Market, there was no place for people to set foot.
The crowd was the same in every small and big shop.
In such a situation, when the Krishna side of the month of Kartik is celebrated as Dhanatrayodashi, shopping on Dhanatras is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
The Supreme Court upholds the Obama health care law
In a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the health care law named after Barack Obama to be constitutional.
By a 5 - 4 vote, the justices ruled in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's separate order - which would require citizens to purchase or pay a penalty for health insurance before 2014 - that it was constitutional under the government's taxing power.
Chief Justice John Robert supported the four other liberal members of the Court, while the other Justices Scalia, Thaws, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also upheld the remaining articles of the 2,700 - page law, and held that the Health Care Act's requirement that states increase Medicaid eligibility or forfeit all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally unconstitutional.
The petition was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business to block the law.
The law was opposed by all the leading Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary session, including the projected nominee Mitt Romney.
It is true that without money we cannot do our work.
Money is one of the greatest necessities of life, but it is not in our interest to assume that it is the only thing.
We celebrate Dhanteras on the Krishna Tryoshi of the month of Kartika.
Dhanteras is worshipped as the god of wealth and death, Yama.
Money has a very important place in our religion and in our lives.
No money is good or bad.
Our attitude toward money is one of good and bad.
Nothing can be of greater value than the wealth which serves the welfare of mankind, but the wealth which is the cause of pride is worthless.
We should earn money for a holy purpose and spend it for a holy purpose.
It is the duty of every man to earn money for the support of his family.
Some of it should be the spirit of spending on society, but the tendency to accumulate money in an uncontrolled way or in any way destroys our conscience, our personality.
The spirit of charity should always be in mind.
Even a small amount of money you give can be the basis of someone 's livelihood.
We should all think of the many people in society who are living in dire need.
In fact, in the Purusha - stars of life, meaning, religion, work and salvation are given equal importance.
All men desire wealth and success, and they get wealth and success according to their efforts.
The wealth that is associated with honour is the one that lasts.
No matter how rich a criminal may be, he cannot use it properly or be of use to others.
Do not envy someone who has money.
The true rich man is he who creates a channel for the flow of wealth into the many hands.
There is no better use of money than to create employment for others.
Another thing, money is not only in the form of currency.
It would be in your health, your character, your love for others.
Try to become the owner of this wealth.

Special Judge IS Mehta, after hearing the case in a closed room, accepted the plea of NIA and remanded Ahmed to 14 days remand.
According to sources, presenting Ujair Ahmed before the court, the NIA said that Ujair Ahmed was the main accused in the Patna serial blasts along with Imtiaz Ansari and Haider, members of Indian Mujahideen.
Ahmed had introduced many other terrorists to Ansari.
Through interrogation of Ahmed, NIA wants to arrest other accused in the case.
The search for the explosives and the terrorists involved in the bomb is still ongoing.

The NIA had arrested the accused in the Patna serial blasts case, Ujair Ahmed from Ranchi on October 30.
The Special Task Force (STF) has revealed the fraud in PMT 2012 only a day ago.
STF has found irregularities in the roll numbers of 700 students in its investigation.
Out of these, about 125 students were admitted to medical colleges.
Now these students can be denied admission.
After the revelation of STF, the Medical Education Department has started a brawl to cancel the admission of these students.
The department is waiting for the STF to submit a list of all these suspected students.
The list will be sent to the Vardham to revoke the eligibility of the students involved.
However, the department is also seeking legal advice in this case.
The departmental officials say that the students who entered in the year 2012 have completed one year, hence it is necessary to seek legal advice in this matter.
As the case is limited to the investigation of STF, the medical education department officials are not in a position to say anything.
The business manager Tarun Pitore says that if STF submits the list of suspected students with evidence, their admission will be immediately revoked.
Meanwhile, Director of Medical Education Dr. Nirbhaya Srivastava said that the students have not refused to cancel their admission if the fake admissions are found to be correct.
According to STF officials, the fake students involved in PMT of 2012 are being investigated.
After the examination, the list of suspected students will be handed over to the Vishaman.
It may be noted that Vyapam had disqualified 345 suspected students in the PMT examination held in 2013.
Of these 345, the Department of Medical Education has so far cancelled admissions of 84 students.
MLA for Poonch assembly constituency, Ejaz Jan inaugurated the water cooler at the Gurdwara complex.
The MLA said that the Gurdwara has a large number of people coming and going, but water coolers have been installed due to lack of proper drinking water system.
This will provide cool water to the people during the hot summer days.
In winter season, pure plain water will be available.
This will alleviate the problem of drinking water for the pilgrims coming and going.
Members of the Gurdwara Committee and others were also present on the occasion.
If the new government continues its policy of ending the sale of kerosene through rationing after the general elections, then kerosene will not be available at these shops in half a dozen states.
The states where kerosene sales are to be stopped include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Besides these, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some states of the North East are also preparing to close the sale of kerosene.
According to sources in the Ministry of Petroleum, the decision to discontinue the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the States will be taken on two bases.
The first is the rapid electrification of rural areas.
The second basis is LPG connection.
This means that the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in states where most of the rural households have been given LPG connections.
The Ministry of Petroleum has made a strong preparation for this.
The sale of PDS kerosene has already been discontinued in Delhi since October 2013.
Sources said that under this policy, the kerosene quota of Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand has been reduced substantially.
The quota for Punjab was reduced from 2. 72 lakh to 1 lakh kilo litres.
The allocation of kerosene to Uttarakhand was reduced by 70 and to Haryana by about 40.
Despite the cuts, there have been no reports of kerosene shortages from these states.
The Ministry is assuming that this shows that kerosene has been used for blending.
The difference in price of PDS kerosene and diesel is currently Rs. 37.
This encourages the mixers.
In states where the sale through PDS will be discontinued, the oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs. 39 per litre on kerosene.
The Kerosene subsidy burden is estimated to be around Rs. 31 thousand crore in 2013-14.
The accused used to defraud investors by opening accounts in the name of trading in shares by citing the trading firm.
Probably for the first time in the state, a case of fraud involving crores of rupees has been revealed in this kind of disclosure.
The police have not been able to reach the ringleader of the gang, but seven people, including the accused who had seen him operate in the state, have been detained by the police.
The gang operated a fake commodity market under the name of MetaTrader-5.
The debtors of the company used to take cash from investors and give it to them by creating fake IDs on a fake software.
The accused would see the shares bought by the investors on trading.
It was even known at what price the shares were bought.
In fact, no shares were bought and no transactions were made for them, as no demat account of investors was opened and the shares were shown as false on the fake software.
Police are estimating that hundreds of people have come to the gang's door.
Every investor was given an investment of two to five lakh rupees in the name of profit.
The main accused, Amit Soni, has been taken into custody by the cyber cell from Jodhpur, while six others have been apprehended from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dohra, any share trading company needs to be associated with the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only after this can the company get investors to trade shares through it.
The investor 's demat account is then opened so that shares can be bought and sold for him, but the company called MetaTrader 5 was not associated with any exchange nor did it trade stocks.
The company had bought the server for itself on September 24, 2012 under the name of Wintrade.
Since then, people have been deceived in the name of investments through this company.
Eight businessmen from Indore have come forward to complain in the cyber cell.
Even after selling the shares bought at a profit, the amount was not transferred to the account.
He started demanding profits from the company 's creditors.
Investors are even saying that the fake IDs they were given were always undervalued.
The accused had set the price at his own level.
The company has appointed its CEOs and agents in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and UP.
The agents would lure people into joining the company with the promise of higher profits.
After this, from some two lakhs to some five lakhs were deposited.

With the sharp bowling of Sohag Ghazi and Mashrafe Murtaza, Bangladesh beat New Zealand by 40 runs in the second ODI to take an unbeaten 2-0 lead in the three-match series.

Anderson and James Neesham combined for eight wickets.
Anderson took four for 40 while Nisham took four for 53.

The Punjab State Power Corporation is earning crores of rupees daily from the current Gate City Circle office in the ruined building.
All the employees are forced to work in fear of accident.
The staff working in the building were terrified as cement fell from the roofs of the building.
The building was built in 1913 during the British era and was the office of the former Municipal Corporation.
In 1995 the building was handed over to the power board.
The department is sweeping the floor by merely making the repairs look like a sham.
The building is in such a bad condition that the staff are afraid to even sit in it.
The condition of the building is so poor that plaster often falls from the roofs.
In the last one month, cement has fallen from the roofs of four rooms.
A female employee has also been injured.
JE and the Revenue Accountant were saved alive.
At present, the building has about four hundred and fifty employees.
This includes 5 XENs, 12 SDOs, 20 Junior Engineers, 130 Clerical Staff, 200 Technical Staff and 20 other Staff Members including SE.
The fact is that nothing has been done by the Powercom High Commissioners to protect them.
Three rooms allotted to the ZEZs, the scooter and bicycle stands, two rooms on the upper floor of the building have collapsed completely.
In such a situation, the condition of the building can be easily guessed.

BJP Prime Minister's candidate Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of the Dinanth Mangeshkar Hospital, lashed out at the Congress while addressing an election rally on Friday.
On this occasion, Modi said, "In many states of the country and at the Centre, sometimes coalition governments were formed, sometimes Congress governments, sometimes Communist governments, and sometimes BJP governments.
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits and economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
What team did what.
If the results are comparable, the country will not be faced with the question of whether the BJP should come to power or not.
Everywhere where the BJP has formed a government, there has been an attempt to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
The country is a witness to the fact that inflation was low under the governments of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man was given two meals.
But when the Congress or its backed government came into power, the poor man was not given enough to eat.
Not a single leader of the Congress, not a single leader of the UPA is giving an answer for what they have done in the last nine and a half years.
Even the media in our country cannot reach them.
The Congress has become arrogant.
They do not even answer the media.
You are elected to the Lok Sabha, you answer to the people.
Modi attacked Congress leader Kapil Sibal, saying, "In 2014, when the people bless the BJP, every year it will present its work to the people.
In a democracy, the ruler should not be in Delhi, but the servant.
There can be no nat in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Congress friends keep leaving balloons on the day of their arrival.
Congress friends, we have already passed the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, the people take the examination.
In the case of notary patents, Google, Samsung, Huawei have been sued for financial gain.
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents has filed dozens of patent lawsuits against cell phone makers, including Google, which it beat in the Nortel bankruptcy auction on Thursday.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4. 5 billion, has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies in the U. S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
The indictment said that the patents also included technology that matched search terms to search terms from relevant advertisements on the Internet, which is the core of Google 's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is a fierce competitor to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased the bid several times, eventually offering $4. 4 billion.
After losing to Rockstar in the Nortel patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons being that Motorola had a long list of patents.
The indictment stated that "Google has violated, and continues to violate, despite losing the auction in an attempt to acquire patents-in-court".
Rockstar has sought increased damages against Google, alleging that it is infringing on patents by Google.
Believed in Egypt's first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his victory day has hardly ended the political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he took the oath of office as the country's first freely elected president, replacing the ousted Hosni Mubarak 16 months ago.
At his formal installation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi becomes the first independently elected Islamist president in the Arab world, and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy nearly 60 years ago.
He took the oath in front of 18 judges wearing black robes of the court on his chair on the bank of the Nile, which resembled an ancient Egyptian temple.
During the ceremony, which was shown live on national television, Morsi said that "we are aspiring to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic".
The radical Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years since its founding as an outlawed organization and which has been targeted by previous governments, said Morsi, 60, a US-trained engineer with the party, "The Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life today - full freedom, true democracy and stability".
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building and arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 am local time.
Unlike the president 's bustle of the Mubarak era, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the new president, with traffic stopped for a short time to allow their motorcade to leave the normally busy road that connects the city centre to its southern suburbs.
Moorsi, derided as the Brotherhood's non-Christian "empty tire", saw his personal standing greatly enhanced after his victory and his speech on Friday presented him as the candidate of not just Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 revolution against the dictator Mubarak.
Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and red tie, took the oath of office in front of the judges sitting in a wood - panelled chamber, saying that "today Egypt is a citizen, a national, constitutional and modern nation".
Morsi then moved to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was officially welcomed by the military band playing the national anthem, while he stood in the posture of vigilante.
The military ruler, Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi was also present.
Upon his arrival, hundreds of people in the lecture hall of the main university there welcomed him with the slogan "Army and people are one hand".
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a bastion of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi was symbolically sworn in at Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorship last year, and vowed to withdraw presidential powers from the deposed leader, who was deposed by a military council last year.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court rather than the customary swearing - in of the Parliament, he bowed to the will of the military, a sign that the struggle for power would continue.
Morsi 's speech at Tahrir Square was full of dramatic popular expressions.

Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases US spying had gone too far.
He also claimed that innocent people have not been tortured under the intelligence surveillance programme.

I can assure you that innocent people are not being tortured in this process.
But in some cases inappropriate methods have been used in the attempt to obtain information.
Meanwhile, a key committee of the US Congress has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
The aim is to make surveillance more transparent and to restore the trust of the people that has been damaged by the revelations of massive phone tapping.
The Senate move has been welcomed by six US companies, including Google and Yahoo.
The NSA has also raided the data centres of these companies.
The Senate Select Committee on Appropriations passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill [FISA] that cuts the NSA on Friday by a vote of 11 to 4.
The bill mentions several restrictions, including a ban on unilateral phone tapping under the USA Patriot Act.
Under FISA, the deliberate and unauthorised collection and use of data will be criminalised and punishable by up to ten years in prison.
The bill will become law after it is passed in both houses of Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Chairman of the committee and Senator Diane Festin said that the NSA's phone recording program is within the law and I believe it has made a significant contribution to the security of the country.
But there is a need to bring more transparency to it.
Moreover, the security of the public 's privacy must also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook, outraged by the revelation of the NSA's internet surveillance program, have supported the bill.
In a letter to senators, the companies said they welcomed the lawmakers' proposal to curb the NSA's massive phone recordings.
The NSA's activities were revealed in documents released by former CIA employee Edward Snowden.
There is outrage in the international community after the NSA's surveillance of the telephone conversations of the heads of state of 35 countries including Germany and France was revealed.

So you think travel agents are a thing of the past, thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre is pushing this trend.
The company has raised its full year profit forecast, and is expecting record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company expects its full-year pretax underlying profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with the previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If the target is met as per the current guidance, this would be an increase of 12 to 17 per cent in the record $ 290. 4 million achieved in 2011 - 12.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made a profit of 8 per cent in the first half, and had made a good start in its second half, particularly in non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
"So far, our 10 countries are in profit, and many more are on track for record full - year earnings before interest and tax contributions", he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally our most profitable centres.

Flight Center shares were up 3 cents yesterday at $38.20.
A recent media report said that the NSA had leaked information from Yahoo and Google data centers for spying.
The Washington Post has revealed this based on documents obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
The NSA's program, called Muscular, was reportedly run in conjunction with its British counterpart, GCHQ.
The two agencies stole data that passed through the vast fiber optic cable networks laid by Yahoo and Google.
The Washington Post quotes a top secret document dated January 9, 2013 that says more than 18 crore documents were gathered in just three days of the program's launch.
These include email, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run outside the US and an anonymous telecommunications provider helped the NSA gain access to the information.
According to the newspaper, it was easier for the NSA to run the program outside the United States, as court orders are required for such operations in the United States.
NSA chief General Keith Alexander denied the allegations during a press conference in Washington, saying, "As far as I know, this never happened".
The NSA has always acquired all information within the limits of the law.
The NSA was recently targeted for spying on the German Chancellor.
The United Nations said Wednesday that the US administration had assured it would not monitor its communications.
The US has also said that the communications system of the UN is not monitored.

Schools have taken the initiative to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar.
In English literature courses, students must read at least one Shakespearean play, a 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and a contemporary British story after 1914.
The exam will also include "Unseen Text" to encourage more reading.
A combined English literature and language course will be abolished.
From 2015 students will have to take a separate G.C.S.E. in the language, and there will be much more motivation to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Education Department will launch new syllabus for English and Mathematics tomorrow - these will be the first two subjects to undergo a revolutionary change.
It will also change other core subjects next year.
In a separate step, the examination regulator will showcase the changes in the structure of GCSE with the ofqual, new grading system, and reduced syllabus.
Speaking in the heat, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that "there was a great deal of consensus that we needed to reform our examination system to restore public confidence". He said that the GCSE would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies found that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year - or 3 hours a week during term time compared to most countries.
Australian schools, by comparison, provide students with an average of 143 hours a year, compared to an average of 138 hours in Singapore.
While there will be no formal requirement to give more time to Maths, the Alliance sources said that combining Maths with the subjects in the comprehensive GCSE - League table for greater weighting was likely to encourage provision of additional teaching in schools.
The course will focus more on "real world problems" including financial mathematics.

Surrounded by questions from the opposition at the railway gate, Bunsal at one point put the opposition in a dilemma by saying that he had not looked at a woman in 15 years.
After this, all were surprised as to where the woman 's words came from.
Perhaps Bansal was referring to the domestic relations of a senior BJP leader and a councillor.
Turning the matter around, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had conspired to get a woman to complain about him during the last parliamentary elections, which failed.
Talking to reporters, Bansal said that he has been questioned by the CBI in connection with rail bribery.
If they were made witnesses in the case, then they would have been made after thorough investigation?
Bal said that he had written a letter for only one needy person in the booth scam he was talking about.

The Cabinet meeting was marked by an exchange of greetings.
At the end of the meeting, Singh praised the Chief Minister for his speech in the Chhitan Camp in which he had retaliated against Narendra Modi.
He also said that he had no other thoughts in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges must be met with courage.
The Chief Minister also had the same expression that he took Singh 's speech in a positive manner.
It may be recalled that Singh had requested the Chief Minister to respect the workers in the Chintan camp and to protect them from alleged harassment by the officers.
However, he also said that he was ready to resign from the cabinet to keep his word.
However, after the opinion that emerged in the Chithyan camp, there are signs of renewed thinking in the matter of placing workers in government posts.
In the camp, the state JDU president Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the nomination of the workers in the 20 point committees would be announced soon.
It was also a sign that the list was almost ready.
It is being reported that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will now personally review the list from his level.
They will also check whether the MLAs - MPs have been consulted in the making of the list.
The list will be extensively revised to accommodate older and committed workers if required.
It is a common complaint of the MLAs that their views were not taken in making the list of nominations.
The names of people from other parties have been added much later, while many important activists active since the days of the Samata Party have been overlooked.
Some people are born with a silver spoon, some make their lives a model through their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One such person is Dhidhirubai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani was born on 28 December 1932. He was the third son of Hirachand Govardhan Das Ambani, who was a teacher in a school in a small village of Chorwad in Gujarat.
Dhirubhai was the third of five siblings.
The family has five children, including Ramniklal, Natwarlal, Dhirubhai and two sisters, Trilochna and Jasumati.
Due to financial strain, Dhirubhai had to leave school after completing high school.
Dhirubhai had started to help the household financially in childhood.
At this time he used to set up a shop near Giranar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Dhirubhai's first job was in 1949 when he arrived in Aden, Yemen, on a ship called the Kabotta at the age of 17.
His elder brother Ramniklal had made all the arrangements for him here, so he had no trouble finding a job abroad.
But Dhirubhai had something else in mind.
So in 1954 he returned to his native country.
In 1955 Luckaman arrived in Mumbai with Rs. 500 in his pocket.
And that was the beginning of his business journey.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such steps that he never looked back.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left this world on 6th July 2002.
At that time he was the owner of Rs. 62,000 crores.
His sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are currently in charge of his Sultanate.
Today, like his father, these two brothers are also internationally known businessmen.
Who does not know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

It is going to cost a lot to kill mosquitoes to avoid diseases like dengue, malaria, filariasis.
The state government is going to triple the tax on repellent, mats, liquid used to kill mosquitoes.
The proposal for raising the tax will be tabled in the Cabinet soon.
The government, which is facing a financial crisis, is looking for every possible way to increase its earnings these days.
The Resource Committee, headed by Minister of Urban Development Mohammad Azam Khan, has been constituted to improve the financial health of the Government.
According to sources, the Committee rejected several of the tax - raising proposals at the recent Resource Committee meeting, which would have had a direct impact on the general public.
However, the Committee has given green light to the proposal to increase the tax on mosquito repellent, quail, mats and liquids.
The tax on these is proposed to be tripled.
At present, these are subject to four per cent VAT and one per cent additional tax.
Now, 12. 50 VAT and 1. 50 surtax are proposed.
This is expected to generate additional revenue of about Rs.
Tax on Tendubal leaves rejected: Although the Department of Commerce has been in favour of increasing the tax on Tendubal leaves from 5 to 14 per cent to increase the tax revenue, the Financial Resources Committee has rejected the proposal.
The committee believes that the leopard leaf is used in making the beer that the lower classes drink.
Similarly, the committee has not given the green light to the tax increase on electrical goods like transmission wires at present, saying that it may have an impact on the general public.
The proposal to impose green tax on commercial vehicle renewal has also not been considered by the Committee.

Jagran Bureau, Srinagar: Former Minister Ghulam Hassan Khan, who joined Congress from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has reportedly had his security removed by the police.
Khan held the state government responsible for this, saying that his security has been removed for political reasons.
It may be noted that Ghulam Hassan Khan, who won the 2002 election on the PDP ticket from Shopian, was a member of his cabinet while Mufti Muhammad Saeed was the Chief Minister.
Ghulam Hassan Khan said that I have been receiving security cover since 1996.
I live in Shopi's, the so - called terrorist stronghold.
A CRPF security team was stationed at my house under the command of a sub - inspector.
I have bodyguards with me, but on Veerwar, all my security was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security guard was leaving my house, I spoke to the District Deputy Commissioner and District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he merely said he would investigate the matter.
However, when contacted in this context, Kashmir IGP Abdul Ghani Mir denied knowledge of the matter, saying it was a sensitive matter.
I will personally investigate how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been removed.
The Congress chief, Prof. Saifuddin Soze, said that as far as I know, there is no such thing.
If Hassan Khan's security has been compromised, it is a very serious matter.
I am in Jammu at present and will be coming to Kashmir in the next one or two days.
I will discuss the issue with the concerned administration.
According to this report, the UPA government has spent Rs. 8.5 crore during the last four years to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Contrary to Modi 's claims, during the NDA 's tenure (between 1999 and 2004) and the tenure of Atal Vihari Bajpayee as PM, there was a period when no advertisement was issued by the government for two consecutive years (2001 - 2002) on Patel.
While laying the foundation stone of the 182 meter Statue of Unity of Sardar Patel in Kevadia, Gujarat on Thursday, Prime Minister Modi said, "Before, there was no advertisement on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
While the DAVP records show that the UPA has spent Rs. 30 lakh in the year 2009-10, Rs. 4. 10 crore in 2010-11, Rs.
When asked about Modi's claims, Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Manish Tiwari said that BJP PM candidates do not speak on the basis of facts.
The UPA failed to bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
Tiwari said that this was due to the economic recession that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel 's advertisements is far less than that spent on the jubilees and death anniversaries of members of the Nehru - Gandhi family every year.
DVP spent Rs. 33 crore on print advertisements for the birth and death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Rs. 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, Rs. 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs.
When asked about the difference, Manish Tiwari said, "It should not be seen in terms of spending on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including the size of the advertisement or the rate of advertising for that year, etc.
The real point is that it shows our dedication, which the opposition people are unwittingly trying to take over the legacy of a great leader.
Today, he will meet the families of those who were killed in the Patna rally on last Sunday.

State Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has alleged that the BJP is trying to distort the atmosphere.
Moving through mud, rivers and jungles to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Weyl, providing free health care in rural areas of Cameroon
Well and his team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
West African countries don't have many doctors; there's only one doctor for every 5,000 people.
Vote here or via mobile
Dr. Georges Weil is one of the top 10 heroes of the year 2013 by CNN.
You can vote for them or for anyone else in the top 10 to make CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Vail watched his sick father pass into and out of consciousness, going to hospitals that were not properly equipped to assist him.
Jameel Wael was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first he had only a broken arm, but an infection developed that spread to his brain, and it produced a blood clot, which affected him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neurosurgery in Cameroon", says Georges Weil.
If we had money, we would have taken my father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Weill kept his father in the crowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment he could get.
"It's not easy", said Weil.
You leave your house at 5 a.m. expecting to be the first person to arrive at the hospital, but it doesn't happen.
But there are many patients.
Some people can wait and die.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Weil's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor for every 5,000 people.
By comparison, the United States has one doctor for every 413 persons.
And even if there are doctors, many Cameroonians cannot afford it.
Two in five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two thirds of the expenditure on health care in the country is from the private sector.
"Their only problem is poverty", says Vail.
And because they are poor, they cannot enjoy their life.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Vael resolved to do something about it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
And he started the non-profit organization Esquivim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others take a van, tie medical supplies to the roof and drive to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes luck is not on their side.
They have to push the vehicle through rivers and mud more than once.
But when they arrive, they are greeted with the real heroes: feasting, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community has to offer.
The free medical services in these villages are a real cause for celebration, and the Vel - with their big smiles and endless energy - are joyously involved in it.
The next morning, his team begins to visit hundreds of patients.
"We meet 500 people on each trip", said Vail.
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics offer a wide range of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get a backpack, a donated pair of glasses, or a free birth certificate -- a document that schools need but that many poor families can't afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgeries with local anaesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school building, town hall or at home; after the procedure, the patient walks to the recovery area, and makes room for the next person.
The group 's generator lights up the operating room and the sanitising equipment, and Weil and his volunteers get up early on Sunday morning.
It is a slow pace, but the village musicians generally help keep the troupe motivated.
"They keep drumming all night to keep us awake and to keep us going", said Vail.
On Sunday, his crew returns to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group - which includes doctors from Cameroon and foreign medical students - performed 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their help can change the world for the people they help.
One person said that he would be able to go back to work due to receiving free hernia surgery.
The man said, "This will change my future and my family's future".
Apart from running a weekend clinic and working as a surgeon in a hospital, Well also works at night in a private medical clinic around Yunda.
He said that this is his second job which finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is completed by private donations.
"I don't know when they go to sleep", said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Weil's group.
They're either always in the hospital, or they're trying to raise money for their organization so they can keep running these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join WELL's campaign, it is an experimental opportunity that they may never get in their own country.
"We have been able to gain experimental experience in the surgeries in which we assist Dr. Weil in picking up instruments or clearing blood stains", said O'Malley.
You would never get the opportunity to do that as a second year medical student in the United States.
The volunteer students usually pay their own way to Cameroon, and they often come with donated medical supplies.
But after they have reached puberty, they bear the expense of their stay and the instructions.
"There is no doubt that they are heroes", says O'Malley.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon will never end.
For Vel, the burden of almost a job is not difficult.
Helping others to live happy lives, fulfilling a promise to their father, these are the things that bring them great joy.
"I find great joy in doing this work", says Val.
And I think about my father.
I hope they're watching what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to ease their pain.

Addressing a rally, Modi said, "If you look at the speeches of Congress or the UPA leaders in the last two months, you will find that they do not talk about what they have done".
He said, "Congress has become so arrogant that it does not answer the media's questions".
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government is there, yet he needs answers from Modi.
It is your duty to answer to the public.
Apparently Modi was responding to Sibal who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants a controlled environment where he gives his speeches and does not speak to journalists to avoid questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to debate face to face.
"I promise the people of the country that when the BJP forms the government in 2014, we will present a report to the people every year", Modi said.

Obama's health care proposal withdrawn
Amid a barrage of criticism, President Obama yesterday withdrew his oft-repeated deceptive promise that "you can keep your health plan if you like it".
With millions of people receiving cancellation notices from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president for misleading American citizens in recent days.
Yesterday Obama changed his actual message.
In a speech in Boston, he said that "many people who have health insurance, and it is useful, can continue to have it".
Addressing what he calls the "news flash", Obama has graciously purchased new coverage in the marketplace from American citizens who receive these reports.
Most people would be able to get a better deal, a comprehensive health care plan for the same money or cheaper than the one being offered.
They said, "You'll get a better deal".
The administration has said that it should come as no surprise that 5 percent of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plans because their coverage does not meet the standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
In a statement before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said, "I say to these American citizens straight out, 'You deserve better than this.'"
Sebelius, who is taking over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace since October has been "unfortunate".
He said, "I am as frustrated and angry as anyone else".
I want to earn your trust again.
After a sharp skirmish with Republicans yesterday at a House hearing, Sebelius angrily said the following sentence, which was intercepted by a mike, to a fellow Republican sitting behind him, about whether he would need to be enrolled in Obamacare.
In a hearing that lasted more than three hours, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily forfeited government - sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through Healthcare.gov, which it is now selling to millions of Americans.

This has led to a decline in the number of cases of code violation.
From the date of enactment of the Election Code in October to 21st October, 313 cases were registered against various political parties.
There are only 31 cases from 22 to 27 October.
With the introduction of the Election Code of Conduct, cases of violation of the same were also coming up.
In the early days, there were more complaints, but gradually it has started to decrease.
It is being told that in the early days, due to lack of full knowledge about the code of conduct, more complaints were coming against the political parties.
The Commission has been aware of the political parties and has taken lessons from the recorded case, which has resulted in fewer complaints.
Many parties were campaigning as before, in the absence of information, but when action was taken against them, they stopped it.
Political parties are following the Code of Conduct with the acquisition of information.
This has also reduced the number of violations.
ADA has sent a proposal to the Government in this regard, which will be approved soon.
In this historical city, surrounded on three sides by the Ganges and the Yamuna, there is no longer any plot on which the ADA can plan any large residential development.

Asaram, who is in judicial custody in Central Jail here for alleged sexual harassment of a minor student, will be in jail this Diwali.
As well as Jodhpur, Asaram is also accused of raping a girl in Surat.
His son, Narayan Sai, has been on the run from the police.
And that is why an arrest warrant has been issued against him by the Gujarat Police.
It is also being reported from Ahmedabad that even the trustees of Asaram have now gradually started to shy away from Asaram.
Besides, action is also being taken against the ashrams of Asaram that are built illegally or on government land.
We have already told you that Asaram is the owner of more than 400 ashrams.
One of these ashrams is in New Jersey, USA.
Accusations are being made against Asaram and his son.
But the blind faith of many of his devotees is not over.
Asaram has as much dominance not only in India but also in America.
In India, even though Asaram is in jail and his devotees are getting away from him, it is not the same here in America.
In the New Jersey Ashram, devotees are still visiting the Ashram and seeing the Asaram as before.
In an unexpected admission, John Kerry said that U.S. intelligence "has gone too far beyond what is appropriate".
John Kerry has unexpectedly signaled the softening of the U. S. protective attitude toward its surveillance program by admitting that its espionage sometimes "goes too far".
The Minister of State has also admitted that he is guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on "automatic pilot" in the form of insidious disclosures to whistleblower Edward Snowden about the exposure of NSA spying activities.
The revelation has brought a diplomatic upheaval to the US government's relations with its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Open Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, myself, and others in the government were actually aware of some of the things that were going on with the autopilot, because looking back to the difficult years of World War II, and the Cold War, and then, certainly, 9/11 had its potential.
They have become the first high-ranking members of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage has crossed its own line, but insisted that no one's rights have been abused.
He said: "In some cases, it has gone unnecessarily far".
The President is determined to try to make this clear to the people and is now reviewing it thoroughly so that no one feels misused.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry emphasized that the NSA was, however, working for a good cause, and its surveillance work has saved many lives.
He added: "We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up".
There is radical militancy in the world, committed to killing people, blowing them up and attacking governments.
So if you can stop it before it happens, what's the problem?
We have prevented planes from actually crashing, buildings from collapsing, and people from being killed because we have been able to know in advance what others were planning.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday that U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to help address concerns abroad about so-called U.S. espionage, and will try to convince European countries of the need to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about the threat of their participation in counterterrorism organizations being blocked because of the National Security Agency's surveillance scare.
Murphy, the first-ever Democratic Party nominee and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington that "it is really important to the U.S. national security interests that European countries are with us in terms of our counterterrorism efforts".
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be swayed by their anger about the NSA program.
Reports of NSA recording millions of phone calls from Europe have soured relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency chief said the reports are not entirely accurate, and reflect a misunderstanding of the metadata NATO allies have collected and shared with the United Nations.
Other revelations in Snowden's leaked documents suggest that the NSA monitored the cellphones of 34 other top world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Defending the practice of spying on allied countries, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper called it necessary and said it was common practice for both sides to do so.
Amid the commotion, Murphy said his office was arranging a congressional trip that was likely to take place this year, and he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators will be released in the coming days.
He said that the itinerary is still being worked on.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said some "unpractical relations" would also have to be abandoned.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people, even with their own spy programs that have been used for years.
"Although we can modify our surveillance program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying", Murphy said.
Meanwhile, this weekend, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland, where he will address scholarship on U.S. surveillance activities, from U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran.
A new policy of board changes has been initiated in the municipalities.
Recently, the Congress - led board in Sainthia Municipality of Virbhum district was changed to Trinamool Board due to the change of party of councillors.
This change was due to the fact that most of the Congress councillors, including the chairman of the municipality, joined the Trinamool.
Not only the Congress but also the CPI, the CPI - MA and some councillors of the Forward Bloc have started suppressing the Trinamool here.
Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Roy sees this as a good sign for the party.
He says 10 Congress councillors, including Saithia Municipal Chairman, Virendra Parikh, and Congress leader, Viplav Dutta, joined the Trinamool.
Some members of the Left Front, including the CCP, have also taken up the banner of the Trinamool.
All have informed the District Magistrate in writing under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become a part of Trinamool and that the Sanithiya Municipal Board has also come under the control of Trinamool as per the numbers.
Shri Rai also claims that everyone agrees with the blueprint of Bengal development laid out under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders from other parties, including the Congress, the CPP, the BJP, and the Forward Bloc, are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
The worthy leaders of any party are welcome in the TMC.
The Trinamool takeover of the municipal board is being seen as a key issue in political circles due to the change of party of the Congress councillors in the Saithya Municipality ahead of the elections in the five municipalities on November 22.
First, in Haldia, ruled by the Left Front, and in Nadiya, the Congress - ruled municipality, the Trinamool has seized control of the board.
When the Trinamool takes over the municipal boards in the districts due to party changes, the party 's new members are given a grand welcome at the Trinamool building in Kolkata.
The Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Rai is excited about the leaders joining the Trinamool, breaking away from other parties.
He says that those who break away from any party are welcome in the Trinamool.
He claims that the people are gaining confidence in Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's leadership, which has resulted in people wanting to join Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party, the MACPA, says that lower-level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People are joining the Trinamool Congress out of fear of the terror.
The CPP is considering the changes to the elected local body boards as a blow to democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its base but the legitimacy of changing the votes in the power is questionable.
Australian woman appeals against Thai jail term
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney has been sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for falsely accusing a taxi driver of assault, appealing the decision and gaining bail.
On June 15, the Phuket Provincial Court found Stevie Rochelle Bamford guilty of falsely accusing the Thai police of a local taxi driver who, along with two other individuals, attempted to stop him on the morning of Sunday, June 10.
But later CCTV footage showed that she had safely returned to the hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Baumfort admitted to fabricating the story after being questioned by Phuket police for two days.
He was kept in the local police cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low - security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket instead of an adult women 's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Department of External Affairs in Canberra to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney 's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family is "very worried" about their daughter' s care and they want to recall her back to Australia.
"This has undoubtedly been a worrying time for us, but we hope she will be back home as soon as possible", Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports in Australia meanwhile said she was vacationing at Krabi's holiday resort in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand said that Bamford's case was being fought by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court could extend his sentence to two years and force him to serve time in an adult prison.
Similarly, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek acquittal in an attempt to improve its bad tourist image.
