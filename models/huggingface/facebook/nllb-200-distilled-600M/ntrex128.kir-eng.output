Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that we will be embarrassed
Some Members of the Welsh Assembly have been confused over changing their name to MWP (short for Assembly of the Parliament of Wales).
This issue arose after the change of the name of the Assembly to the Assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
Across the political spectrum, the members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that we should not be ridiculed.
One Labour Party member said that the word MWP is a corruption of the English words Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales, "twp" in Welsh means "dishonesty", and "pwp" means "law".
A member of the Assembly in the Scottish national dress said that the group was completely outraged and suggested other names.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was positive about changing the name, but that when it was shortened it was like "coming".
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is similar in pronunciation to the Yorkshire English letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to change its name, said, "The final decision of the legislators is, of course, in the hands of the members of the Assembly as to what the members of the Assembly are to be called".
The Welsh Government has authorised the Welsh Assembly to change its name by Act 2017.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation, which found that it supported the name of the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
The Commission preferred the title of Members of the Assembly to Members of the Welsh Parliament or "WMP", but the proposal of "MWP" was supported by a large number of public consultants.
The Assembly's leaders may be proposing other approaches, but the struggle to reach a consensus for the president, Elaine Jones, who is willing to pass the bill within a week, could be a headache.
Legislation for reforms includes changes to how the Assembly should function, including rules for disqualifying Assembly members and establishing a commission system.
The members of the Assembly will make a final decision on the name of the name after the bill has been discussed.
Macedonians go to a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The election was designed to resolve a longstanding dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long been concerned about the name of its northern neighbor, who has repeatedly opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
Against the referendum on changing the name, Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov told him not to ignore the votes.
And yet, the referendum's supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that changing the name is a right to join the EU and NATO.
Since the suppression of the Harlem Cathedral , the bell of St. Martin Fall is quiet
"Often, the elderly people I talk to tell me that there are churches around every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today none of them are".
It's a way to understand that the "bars" are gone".
Today, people communicate in a different way.
The bar was no longer a busy, quiet, relaxing place.
The church's position is that the proceeds from the sale of property will soon be what the leaders thought, and that "sooner or later they will return to where they started".
He said that churches were replaced by condominiums filled with people who were not able to support the rest of the village.
Most people who buy condominiums from these buildings are white people". So people who move into these condominiums are unlikely to be members of these churches, so the days of church closures are accelerating.
Both churches were built in 1870 by the Black Metropolis of Harlem, before becoming the Metropolitan Society, and 10 years later St. Martin.
The original white Methodist movement moved in 1930.
A black religious group that had a place of worship nearby had a building.
The Black Religious Order of St. Martin was led by St. John Howard Johnson, who opposed the merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or raise black people.
In 1939, a fire destroyed the building, but members of the church community who visited Father Johnson planned to restore it and made the arrangements.
St. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and a follower of St. Martin, proudly called the carillon the bell of the poor.
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it another: the traditional treasure and the historical instrument that cannot be played.
And the expert at the University of Michigan, Tiffany N., has identified this as the world's first black musician to play the carillon, Dioniscio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not taken his place.
In the last few months, St. Martin's has been filled with a complex history of architects and performers, some brought by clergy and others by the bishopric.
Although the diocese did not hire architects and performers, it wrote to the diocese in July requesting that the fees be transferred to the diocese.
Some churchgoers complained about the lack of clarity on the part of the bishop.
Sharks attacked and injured a 13-year-old lobster hunter in California
Officials say that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was drowning in lobster holding this Saturday in California at the opening of lobster season.
The attack was near Beacon Beach in Encinitas at about 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV channel that while he was in the water with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, he heard a boy shout for help and then drove his group out of the water in a boat.
At first, Hammel thought that the boy was shouting joyfully because he had caught the lobster, but he soon realized that he was shouting, "I've been kicked!"
"I was knocked out!"
"When the baby was born, he lost his whole leg", says Hammel.
I shouted, "Come out of the water, and I'll tell you, there's a shark in the water".
The child was flown to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
It is not known what species of shark attacked.
Captain Larry Gillz told the media in a brief statement that a shark had been present for several weeks, but that the species was found to be safe.
Gillz added that the injured child suffered a serious chest injury.
For investigative and security purposes, officials closed the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Yesinitas for 48 hours.
He said that there are over 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury is planning to enter the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's is a department store full of professional assistants, with a line of beauty products that go all the way to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
As part of a significant move into the UK's growing £2.8 billion beauty market, while three British fashion and beauty products are being sold at a discount, larger sets of beauty products are being tested in 11 stores across the country and will be added next year if successful.
Supermarkets have started to invest in beauty by putting their screens, microwave ovens and other household items away from their beauty products.
Sainsbury's says it will add two brands to its beauty offerings for more than 3,000 products, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and for the first time, Dr.PawPaw.
The existing L&#39;Oreal, Maybelline, Burt&#39;s Bees range also has more space in branded areas like Boots.
The supermarket is also reopening a vegetarian paint shop for boutiques that are in high demand from young shoppers.
In addition, two Sainsbury's stores are competing for the fragrance shop, one of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the other will open later this year in Selley Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarkets are becoming more and more active to attract people because they are tired of buying online and in small shops nearby.
According to Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, Sainsbury's offers more services and food than just outlets, like a department store, and supermarkets offer discounts to resemble Aldi and Liddle.
Since Sainsbury's bought both of these two stores two years ago, it's put out hundreds of Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and it's built a lot of Habitat networks, which has saved sales and increased revenue from additions.
Efforts to improve the former beauty and pharmacy departments of the supermarket have failed.
Sainsbury's worked with Boots in the 2000s, but they broke up without a distribution of revenue from their supermarket pharmacy.
Sainsbury's new strategy came after it sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds is also expected to play a key role in the plan, adding a wide range of affordable face care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, across four lines.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said, "We've completely changed the look and feel of our beauty departments for our customers.
We also invested in a specially trained staff who were willing to advise.
Our brands are designed to meet everyone's needs, and being in the right place and environment means we're a comfortable beautician against old fashioned ways.
Peter Jones was furious that Holly Willoughby had pulled out an 11-million dollar deal.
When host Holly Willoughby signed the $11 million contract, Peter Jones, the star of Dragons, was furious that he was planning a new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV, other than the clothing line.
Willowby doesn't have time to focus on her Truly clothing accessories brand.
Both of them were similar to Gwyneth Peltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host, 37, announced that he was leaving for Instagram.
Holly Willoughby, who worked with Dragons's star Peter Jones to pay attention to her new amazing deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV, is a lifestyle brand that has left the business at the last minute and is now being smashed.
Sources said that Jones was furious when the Golden Daughter of the Competition met on Tuesday at its headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when she admitted that her new £1.5 million contract was no longer in time for the Truly clothing and accessories brand.
This business was compared to Gwyneth Peltrow's Goop brand, doubling Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
37-year-old Willoughby, who announced his departure from Truly on Instagram, flew from Britain to one of Jones' holiday homes.
"Truly was above Holly's priorities", the source said.
He tied his long-term future to it, and he would work for at least another 20 years.
When he came out, they were all amazed and opened their mouths.
The incident on Tuesday was incredible, and it was just beginning.
The warehouse at Marlow's headquarters is ready to go on sale.
Experts think that the departure of one of Britain's most profitable stars, The Morning Presenter, will cause the firm to lose millions because of the huge investment in products from recorders and lamps to clothing, and the opening may be delayed further.
And long-term friendships also end.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and his wife, Dan Baldwin, were friends with his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Kapp in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
Friends are on vacation together, and he owns 40 percent of the TV advertising business of John Baldwin.
Willoughby was going to be a brand ambassador for M&S and he's going to be Ant McPartlin on ITV's I Know What I Do.
A source close to Jones said that evening, "We will not comment on his business".
We had a hard conversation and then we fell in love.
He joked about the media criticism of some people for saying "presidential" things and being so positive about North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump obey so much?
Trump said in a whispering voice:
I was not obedient.
After Trump praised the first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step in North Korea's nuclear disarmament, Kim said he was ready for a second meeting.
But the denuclearization talks were halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Ambassador-General Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had no response to US disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted that the US continued to impose pressure-based sanctions.
Trump's speech was a bit of an optimistic one.
He said, "We're the best with North Korea".
We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We're in the best of relationships right now.
Efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results, including the end of rocket tests, the free transfer of aid, the return of American personnel to their homes.
He was justified for his special relationship with Kim.
It's easy to be president, but it's better to have 200 people standing here before you have 10,000 people outside who can't get into this square", Trump said, pointing to the crowd at the time.
The tsunami and earthquake that devastated the island in Indonesia claimed hundreds of lives.
After the earthquake, Lombok said that no foreign NGOs were needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population was wiped out, it was not declared a national disaster, but a condition for international aid.
In many cases, unfortunately, it was too obvious that they were not asking for international help, so it was a little complicated".
The children's organization Sacka is gathering community members to visit Palo, but it is not yet clear whether foreign employees can work there.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials had assessed the situation in Palo and said that international organizations could contribute to the relief effort.
The earthquake in Indonesia is so intense that the country is unprepared for the effects of natural disasters.
As a result, the tsunami was a natural hazard that could not be seen anywhere else.
The lack of a tsunami warning signal in Palud was also a major cause of death.
Although it is the best time of year, it is very difficult to travel between many of Indonesia's islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
To help earthquake victims, a hospital ship in Lombok allowed Palou to sail, but it would take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's broken infrastructure the focus of his campaign and is devoting money to improving roads and railways.
But the lack of funding is a major problem for Mr. Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also under long-standing pressure from religious leaders in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims are conservative.
In the streets of the city, more than 1,000 people died in a battle between Christian and Muslim gangs, with spears, bows, and arrows, and more than 10,000 were forced to flee their homes.
See, Liverpool's Daniel Starridge is tied with Chelsea.
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea in the final 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Starridge took a pass from Shakiri from Earth, 30 yards (27 m) from Chelsea's gate, and scored 1-0.
He took the ball to the left, climbing a long line.
In this attempt, the group flew very high and landed at the right corner of the net.
They jumped over the Kephas of Arrysalabla and caught the net.
"It was an effort to get the ball in the right position, and players like Shaq did their best, so I did my best", Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanty coming, and I immediately took the opportunity".
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead in the 25th minute, with the help of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Before the team went through the middle of the field and to the half of Liverpool, Blue Attacker gave a pass to Mateo Kovacic.
Kovacic quickly took the pass from the middle of the line and gave it back.
He then handed the ball over to Hazarad, who had been in the middle of the field.
Hazard is going to go over the defender and then left to catch Liverpool's Alison Baker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday at 3pm at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00pm in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832.
The Indonesian Agency for Disaster Management said on Sunday that 832 people died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Many people were standing in front of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-point earthquake that caused waves of up to 20 feet high on Friday, said the agency's secretary, Sutopo Purvo Nudhoho, at a conference.
The city of 380,000 people was left in the face of the collapsed buildings of the city.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man and a woman on suspicion of murder.
When a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, the investigation began.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street with knife wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked the people in the area to come and sound their voices if they had heard or seen anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is only in its early stages, but I urge each of you, if anyone is on John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
And I'm going to call everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have a camera in their car that may have captured some very important information for our investigation, and we're going to ask you to contact us.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman's body was found in Birkenhead and that she was found inside the property.
Friends of the woman found this morning came to ask where she was found this afternoon.
The police said that the investigation was ongoing and that they were preparing to report the victim to their relatives.
Grayson, a taxi driver in Mews, tried to break into the apartment, but the police told no one to enter or leave the building.
When he heard this, he was amazed and could not speak.
Residents were told that they would be allowed to enter their homes only after a few hours.
The officer was reported to have said that the entire area was now considered a crime zone.
A woman came to a crime scene crying.
And he kept saying, "What a wonder".
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the curtain, and another van was outside.
Several police officers were standing inside the curtain guarding the high-rise building.
People with information will be asked to contact DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Secret Crime Stoppers at 0800 555 111 by logging in 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's monument in Parliament is the final hit of the "Rewrite History" contest.
It would be fair to remove it, as its Puritan fans have destroyed many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, like the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "a hoax" and "a distorted history".
John Goldsmith, the president of the Cromwell Society, said: "There is no doubt that the current debate on the removal of statues is about removing the statue of Oliver Cromwell from the outside of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell neither ordered nor directed the destruction of the holy sites in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps another Cromwell would have sacrificed himself for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hameau Thornecroft's excellent portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th-century view of the world and a part of the history of the man who many still believe deserves to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph that Cromwell was known to many, perhaps more than to many today, in the late 19th century as the protector of the monarchy against the external pressure of Parliament, at that time, of course.
Whether this is actually the case is an ongoing historical debate.
In any case, the conflict of the mid-17th century was the catalyst for the subsequent development of the people, and Cromwell was a prominent figure on the side of a divided society.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A feral pig bit and killed a Chinese herder.
According to local media, a pig attacked a herd of pigs in a market in southwestern China and killed them.
The South China Morning Post reported that the body of a man identified only by his father's name as "Yuan" was found in a pigsty in the market in the province of Liupanzhou, where his blood was cut and his body was found.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005, in Qinghai Province, China.
He had been in the neighboring province of Yunnan, where he sold 15 pigs on a Wednesday.
The next morning, the man found the body and found the door of the pigsty open.
A large male pig with a mouth full of blood was walking in the pigsty.
The court-medical examination confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds was stabbed to death.
"The leg of the unit was torn and torn", reports the Guiyang Evening News, quoting Wu.
Security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his unit.
The market manager told the Evening Standard that the pig was locked up to prevent other people from attacking, while the police were gathering evidence.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although such attacks are rare, there have been instances of pig attacks on humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, severely injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 650 pounds put a Welsh farmer on a tractor and his wife threatened to drive him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but they can't stop when they taste blood.
"They're just going to be a game.
They're like children, very interested... they don't want to hurt.
You just have to treat them right and have a little respect for them".
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are causing heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States.
Forecasts suggest that the storm will slowly subside as it moves into the cool waters of Mexico's northern coast.
Yet, Rosa will soon bring heavy rain and flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
The storm reached a peak wind speed of 85 mph on Sunday morning at 5 a.m. eastern time, a category 1 storm 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The weather is expected to warm up north on Sunday.
At the same time, it began to form over the Pacific Ocean and drift toward the west coast of the United States, and as a tropical storm approached the Baja Peninsula in California on Monday, it began to push the tropical wave northward toward the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring up to 27 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical moisture, combined with the approaching pressure, will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest.
When rain falls from one to four inches, it causes dangerous flooding, flooding, and landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona, causes heavy rainfall of two to three inches an hour.
In some southwestern areas, especially much of Arizona, rainfall is expected to be between two and four inches.
Because of the rapid spread of tropical rain, there may be sudden flooding.
In such a situation of tropical rain, the worst suggestion is to go out into the desert alone.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, and flashes of lightning can cause strong winds to blow everything.
The nearest cyclone will bring heavy rainfall to some of the southern California coast.
When the rain reaches a half inch, the stream brings in tiny debris and the roads become slippery.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Some of the rainfall from the tropics began to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and it began to rain heavily on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Fort Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
The US will be warmer in October as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics will remain very warm.
Sometimes this causes a sudden change in temperature over a short period of time.
This Sunday, a sudden change in temperature in the central United States is a good example.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis, and Moine, Iowa, is about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, summer heat will recover and expand.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. will experience a warm climate of up to 80 degrees in October, extending from the southern region to the northeastern part.
New York City will be warming to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our forecast for the first half of October is that the temperature in the eastern U.S. will be much higher than normal.
Over 20 million people have seen the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people watched the case of Brett Kavanaugh, a suspect in the Supreme Court on Thursday, on six television networks, who was accused of sexually assaulting Christine Blaisey Ford in 1980.
Meanwhile, with the political upheaval continuing, journalists are interrupting a live broadcast of Friday's program: a project with Senator Jeff Flake that called for an FBI investigation within a week.
Kavanaugh says he is 100% confident in the Ford Senate Legal Committee that he got drunk and stripped off his clothes and held him in high school.
Kavanaugh said with 100 percent confidence that this was not the case.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched the show that Friday.
The company used CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC on average.
Numbers for other channels listed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately obtained.
And Nielsen cannot count the number of people he sees in offices.
And with that in mind, the audience was equal to the audience that saw this football championship or the Academy Awards.
Nielsen said that the Fox News Channel, which strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had an average of 5.69 million viewers in the daytime broadcast.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS showed 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million people, Nielsen said.
After the trial, interest in the Bible continued to increase.
Flake was the main character in the drama Friday.
After the office of the Republican Party filed a complaint about Kavanaugh's election, protesters cried out on CNN and CBS cameras as he was about to get on the elevator to attend the hearing.
He was on CNN live watching the fight for several minutes.
"I'm standing here with you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
"You are strong, but the women are weak".
Before the door of the elevator was closed, Flake's office filed a petition and said that more would be discussed in the committee hearing.
When Kavanaugh's nomination was submitted to the Senate, the Judiciary Committee had to vote, and the cable and live broadcasting networks were broadcast live after hours.
But Flake, as some Democrats say, said that the vote would only be given to the candidate after the FBI had completed a week-long investigation.
That's what Flake came up with after he had an interview with his Democratic friend, Senator Chris Coon.
After consulting with Counsel and a number of other senators, he made the decision.
Flake's influence was strong because Republicans were not strong enough to vote for Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of using Brexit as a "political game".
Britain's Prime Minister, May, accused Brexit of "playing politics", undermining Britain's future, and undermining national interests, of its plans and critics to leave the European Union.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In his interview on the front page of the same newspaper, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called his attack a "victory" attack, criticizing his Chequers plan for Brexit and suggesting that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other.
Wade Simpson shooting: Police arrested Dayton Simpson on suspicion of killing an LSU player.
Police arrested a 20-year-old LSU basketball player on suspicion of the death of Wade Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department reports that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
The official showed a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson, where the police said Sims lost his glasses.
Police found glasses at the scene of the fight and determined that they contained Simpson's DNA, according to the CBS affiliate WAFB.
After Simpson was questioned, the police admitted that he had shot Wade.
His lawyer said that his bail was $350,000.
According to a preliminary report by the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office on Friday, the cause of death was another gunshot wound to the neck.
The department has also been particularly critical of the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the state crime lab, the Southern University Police Department, and the local community, helping and speeding up investigations.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the local law enforcement for "fighting for fairness and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 199-inch boy grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father, Wayne, also played for the LSU basketball team.
He averaged 5.6 points and he increased that to 2.6 points per game last season.
On a Saturday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade told the team that he was shocked and shocked by the time Wade passed away.
"It's always worrying me", Wade said.
A volcano in Mexico City erupted.
The volcano's peaks have reached southern Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday, with 183 ash and gas eruptions recorded in 24 hours.
The center was struck by several sounding and shaking sounds.
Social media images show that in settlements such as Ho Chi Minh City near Mexico City, cars are covered in a thick layer of ash.
Geophysicists have observed that the volcano's movement has been increasing since the September 2017 earthquake of 7.1 in Mexico, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital.
Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The police clashed with Catalan separatists shortly before the independence vote.
On Saturday, protesters clashed with police in Barcelona, six people were arrested, and thousands joined the demonstration for the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote for secession.
Masked separatists beat the police with eggs and powdered powder, which turned into black smoke and dried up the streets full of tourists.
The police used the stakes to stop the protesters that day, and the fighting broke out.
For hours, groups who shouted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" for independence confronted protesters who called themselves "Spain for Life".
According to the local press service, 14 people were slightly injured in the clashes.
A year ago, in a referendum on October 1, Catalans voted for independence, and since then the region has been unstable, as Madrid rejected the referendum as illegal, but Catalans celebrate with opposition.
Most voters chose to be independent, but there were few people who came to the polls because they boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, police clashed with voters in the area in an attempt to stop voting, and nearly 1,000 people were later injured.
Anti-Semitic groups supported national law enforcement and set up a Friday night camp to prevent the fighting.
The demonstrations continued, but he was forced to take a different route.
Narcisse Thermes, 68, an electrician, said he and his wife went to a rally and that he did not know that Catalonia would be independent.
"Last year we had a wonderful time.
"I saw my parents crying and crying because they could vote for independence, but now we're stuck".
This small but important victory in the elections of December last year, the early leaders of the Catalan independence parties, who were persecuted or imprisoned and tried for holding a referendum, are trying to keep up the momentum this year.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, recorded a phone call in support of the police on opposite sides, and said the conflict was being fueled by politicians from both sides.
He said, "It's getting worse and worse".
On Saturday, Oriol Jankeras, one of nine Catalan leaders on trial for the past year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
To run for the European elections is the best way to counter the Spanish government's undermining of democratic values and repression.
London: Several people were arrested after their cars and houses were raided.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly raiding a house in London by car.
The incident occurred at about 7:30 p.m. on Thursday in Belligård Kressent.
The gate and the building itself were damaged, said Death Inspect Bob Blemmins.
The carriage may have been shot.
The Menga tribe defeated Livingston 1-0 and beat the Rangers.
Dolly Menagha's first goal was a win for Livingston.
Livingston surprised the Rangers, their second 18-game losing streak since Steven Gerrard was Abrams' manager.
Dolly Menaghan's shot was different, because Gary Holt took the Highlanders to the second tier.
Gerrard missed the Premier League this season and will play Harts next Sunday, eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will beat Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, at the same time, has been enjoying an unbeaten run with head coach Holt, extending it to six games, and tasting the taste of victory since replacing Kenny Miller a month ago.
Livingston is far from a rough audience.
Holt's team had to challenge the Rangers before they could score a goal.
Scott Robinson broke out and stopped the ball, and then Alan Lisgrow, when he sent the ball to the side, went back and met Craig Haltett's head.
The Rangers felt satisfied just because they were playing in front of the master, because they could disturb the audience.
And that's what brought the main goal.
The Rangers allowed the penalty kick, and the Livingston count, and then he and Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to prove Menaghan, and he scored.
The goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, who knew that Rangers were dominant but defensive, was not often in trouble.
This pattern continued throughout the second half of the game, and Alfredo Morelos actually saved Kelly.
Scott Pittman was the Rangers' goalkeeper, Allan McGregor, who was the leg-breaker, and Lithgow was the other Livingston defender.
Crosses were getting closer and closer to Livingston and they were getting more and more defensive, and at the same time, they were required to have two penalties -- one for replacing Halkett Glenn Middleton, and one for holding the ball.
The phenomenal analysis of Livingston.
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont is in the Tony MacAroni arena.
A great game and a Livingston score.
And they were the most difficult for man, extending the trajectory of the excruciating desire.
Their style and staff have not changed since they joined the elite, and the biggest achievement is Holt, who has been the team's coach since he arrived.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was unreachable, and he organized his best defense, capturing Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Ranger was in a state of shock and discouragement.
They were the best at the time, but this time they didn't meet those standards.
They didn't get the ball, they were just on the other side of the field once, and that was a threat to that Rangers ringing bell.
The Erdogan Gulf was a mixed reception.
The leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday, with a smile and a blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, and the goal is to restore relations with NATO and its allies.
They were fighting for human rights, freedom of speech and Turkey's accession to Europe.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city became home to the largest population of Turks.
The police kept 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque for safety reasons, and many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of rebels against Erdogan, including Kurds, expressed their views, denouncing Erdogan's policies and opposing the German government's corruption.
This duel is a public affair, with some German Turks calling him a hero, and some calling him an autocrat.
Deppford: A bicycle rider dies in a car crash.
A bicycle rider died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at 10:15 a.m. at the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, immediately south-east of the city on Deptford Road.
The driver stopped and the doctors came, but the man died on the spot.
A similar accident occurred a few months ago on Childress Street, a mile away, when a car ran over another cyclist, causing the death of the person.
Metropolitan police were working on identifying the person's name and reporting it to their relatives.
The road was closed, bus routes changed, and drivers were asked to turn around.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were wounded in the riot.
Six prison officials were wounded in a high-security prison during the panic, the prison office said.
The ringing began at around 09:30 on Sunday at the Worcestershire HMP Long Larkin and is still going on.
The Tornado officials were called in to stop the riot, which was caused by eight inmates who were on one wing of the building.
The staff are being treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison press secretary said that special training prison officials came to HMP Long Lartin to solve this case.
Six staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate such violence in prison, and those responsible are handed over to the police and spend a long time in prison.
HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 people, including the country's most dangerous lawbreakers.
In June, a prisoner told the prison warden that he had been hospitalized for injuries after being attacked.
In October last year, OMOON officials were called to the prison to solve the case, when they attacked the officers with pool groups.
The storm is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flooding (which could benefit arid regions).
Tropical depression rarely affects Arizona, but this time early next week, the remaining energy traces of the Rose storm could travel through the southwest desert and cause severe flooding.
The National Weather Service released data on Monday and Tuesday about the unintended flooding, which is expected to occur in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
On Tuesday, Rose continues her journey through Phoenix, arriving on Monday evening with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said on Twitter that 10 tropical cyclones have maintained their tropical storm status, or cyclone status, since 1950, 200 miles from Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was about 40 miles from the border with AZ.
The latest National Hurricane Models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with the Mogollon River rising to 6 inches in Arizona.
In other areas of the desert, including the central Rocky and Big Basin, it can be as small as 1 to 2 inches, and in isolated areas it can be up to 4 inches.
Rose rain is probably best for areas where there are no natural floods, because there is drought in those areas.
Although flooding is a serious problem, it is beneficial for some areas, and probably the southwest is currently experiencing severe drought.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, the second highest category", weather.com reported.
First, the storm Rose is moving into the tropics of the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, the storm, which has winds of 85 miles per hour, will blow 385 miles south into Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 12 miles north.
The storm is being hit by the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean.
So on Monday afternoon or evening, a tropical storm will bring Mexico to the brink of extinction.
In parts of Mexico, heavy rains and flooding have led to flooding.
"The full rainfall range from 3 to 6 inches [to] 10 inches [in the northwest] of Baja California to Sonora", reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will move northward through Mexico, before reaching the Arizona border, with a tropical cyclone early on Tuesday morning, and then across Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
"The main threat to Rose or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, the Sonora Desert in the northwest and the southwest of the United States", the National Snow Center said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and waterborne debris and landslides to mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton assault: Four suspects arrested in the attempted murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old was arrested after another man was found wounded in an assassination attempt.
A teenager was found injured on the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
The injured person is taken to a hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
Internal Affairs reported that suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in Redstock, Avon and Somerset in one night.
Police are calling on anyone who has accessed a mobile device to access information or an incident to cooperate.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffers from the infatuation and anger of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for the Court of Common Pleas is a vote against the Democratic Party's harsh, unrelenting tactics", Trump said in his campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said during his inauguration that Kavanaugh was suffering from the anger and anger of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh presented the Congressional Record to Congress on Thursday, and Christine Blaisey emotionally and resolutely denied Ford's guilt, saying that he raped her as a teenager ten years ago.
Ford himself confessed to the charge before taking the oath.
The president said on Saturday, "All Americans saw Kavanaugh's courage and character that day".
"The vote to appoint the court of Kavanaugh, the vote to appoint the most decent legislator of our time, a lawyer who has served the community tirelessly", he told his supporters in West Virginia.
He also highlighted the importance of the Republican Party's victory in the midterm elections and the nomination of President Kavanaugh.
We are only five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
I run as if I were competing, but I am not competing.
That's why I'm fighting everywhere for good candidates.
Trump believes the goal of the Democrats is to resist without giving in.
The first vote on Kavanagh's nomination in the Senate is expected to be held no later than Friday, the secretary of the Republican Party's leadership apparatus told CNN.
Hundreds of people died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the death toll continues to rise
On Saturday, authorities said that at least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawesi, Indonesia, and that most of them were washed ashore by powerful waves.
On Sunday, hundreds of people gathered in the coastal city of Palos for a beach festival, and waves of up to 18 feet [6.8 m] overwhelmed the city early in the morning, killing many people and destroying everything along the way.
After an earthquake of magnitude 7.5, a tsunami struck.
"When the tsunami hit yesterday, people ran and died for those still working on the coast", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, secretary of the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it brought cars, gardens, houses together, and hit everything on the coast", said Nugroho, who also said the tsunami hit the coast at a speed of 800 km/h in the open sea.
Some fled to the trees to escape the tsunami.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres on the bridge.
The disaster relief agency's air photos show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed, and mosques flooded.
On Saturday, another earthquake struck a coastal city.
Several earthquakes were felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology and Measurement reported in a letter Friday that the earthquake's energy was 200 times greater than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located on a long, narrow coastline, may have contributed to the tsunami's magnitude.
Negroho described the disaster as "a devastating disaster" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found under the ruins, and the number of wounded was 540, the number of missing was 29, the official said.
Nugroho said the disaster's effects may be more severe on the coast in the region of Donggala, 300 km from Palú, closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The contact with the donegal is completely gone, said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said, adding that staff and volunteers have been deployed to the affected areas.
"This is a great tribulation, but it could have been worse".
Although the agency was criticized by the public for not reporting a tsunami on Saturday, officials said that the storm arrived just as the warning was issued.
A witness recorded a video of a man shouting from the top of a building to warn people on the street.
The water walls reached the shore in minutes, and they ran through buildings and machines.
Reuters' news portal was unable to immediately identify the video.
The earthquake and tsunami cut off all power, cut off all communication with Palo, and made rescue efforts even more difficult.
The military division has begun to send supplies by air from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but people still need food and basic items.
The city's airport was reopened for humanitarian purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to arrive at the evacuation centers in Palo Alto on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami killed more than 800 people.
This is terrible.
From Donggala to Palou, World Vision staff were able to see the impact of the disaster, and in Palou, the organization's businessmen were using custom-built houses on the outskirts of the city.
"They told me that they had seen many cows slaughtered".
This is terrible.
Although aid workers have begun to work to reduce the impact of the disaster, some have reported that foreign aid workers have encountered obstacles in their journey to Palou.
Under Indonesian law, foreign aid, aid, or personnel can only come from abroad if a disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"It was declared a national disaster", said Auliya Arjani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
If the government says, "About a national disaster", we'll be open to international aid, but we're not that kind of status.
Friends and families of the people who were lost in the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palud, Spain, did not lose hope that they would be found as a rare miracle story.
On Saturday, a young boy was rescued from a water pipe.
On Saturday, rescuers took out a woman and her mother who had been dead for two days and were buried under the building.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paratroopers, was training missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month.
Among those imprisoned at the Roa Hotel was Mr. Mandagi himself and his students.
"As a person who has worked hard in planners, this is a particularly difficult task for me", he said.
Mr. Gendon Roa said that before the fall of the Roa Hotel, he had sent a WhatsApp message to other parlancers at the Palou Beach Festival.
But instead of the two blue marks that the message was received, there was only one gray mark.
"They don't know", he said.
Livey Newport Street robbers stole $26,750 while they were filling up an ATM.
On Friday, while Levi was filling a ATM at Brink's, robbers stole $26,750, according to a news release from Newport Police.
The driver was preparing to take more money while releasing the ATM at the gambling complex, spy Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was filling in the money, another man ran after the employee of Brink's and stole the money.
Although witnesses reportedly identified several suspects, the police did not say how many people were involved in the crime.
If you have any information about the crime, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: A rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
He tweeted about the name change on Saturday, saying: "It was formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, also known as Ye, used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was expected before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album, Yanni.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande, who has said she will not be on the show for emotional reasons.
West said that the new name was a religious meaning for him, as it was also an abbreviation of his current professional name.
"Yeah, it's a word in the Bible that means 'you,'" West said earlier this year in an interview with Big Boy, the radio host for the album.
So I am you, I am us, we are all us.
The first one is from Kanye, and it has a single meaning, so my name is Ye , our good, our bad, our head-turning, reflecting all of us.
And the album is a reflection of who we are.
He is one of a number of rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is also known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would prefer to be called Love and Love Brother.
JE-ZI, a colleague of West's, changed his name to a capital letter or a capital letter.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised not to use military force against civilians.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that the country will never use military force against ordinary citizens as it approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that he would not use any forces against civilians in the Tlatelolko Plaza.
On October 2, 1968, the military shot down about 300 people who were taking part in a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, one of the first left-wing student protests in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador assured the young Mexicans that they would be able to access more free universities, paying students a monthly fee during their studies.
Unemployment and lack of educational opportunities have motivated youths to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to spend twice as much on artificial intelligence.
While China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US needs to double its research funding for this field, says Kai-Fu Li, a developer who has previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
There were criticisms of AI from all over the US government, including the fact that the US strategy for AI was completely eliminated.
And so, China announced last year its plan: By 2030, it wants to be the world's number one innovator in artificial intelligence.
"Doubling the amount of research on AI would be a good start, given that other countries are far from the US in this direction, and we look forward to the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
And the next big breakthrough in GDP would be to double the chances of the US having a double-capitalization, Lee said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee's book, 
In the 1980s, Carnegie worked at Mellon University on an AI system that was bigger than an American Otelo player, and he was a research executive at Microsoft and president of Google's China branch.
Lee talked about the technology rivalry of the former US government, like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Call, and asked when the next one would be to determine the next audience.
Researchers in the United States have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies are hiring university graduates to work in AI.
Changes in immigration policy could also affect U.S. immigration policy, Lee said.
"I think everyone with a PhD at J.I. should get a green card", he said.
The Chinese government Council announced its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
According to the National Science Foundation and other government agencies that have given US researchers, the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding for people in academic institutions, but their academic work is of a lower quality in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense launched a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to bring business and researchers together, and the White House announced that a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence would be established.
And this month, DARPA announced that it would be spending $2 billion on a project called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation has already invested more than $100 million in AI research.
And so, the US legislation that would create a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country ' s name
The Macedonian people will decide on Sunday in a referendum whether or not the country's name will be the Republic of North Macedonia, which will resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which excludes Macedonia from EU and NATO membership.
Macedonia, a region of Greece, vetoed NATO and the EU's accession, saying that its northern neighbor was claiming its territory.
The two governments were drawn to an agreement on a new name proposed in June, but nationalists say the name change would adversely affect the ethnic isolation of the Macedonian Slav population.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum, and it is estimated that such a boycott against the bill would involve less than 50 percent of the people needed to make the referendum legal.
The referendum question was stated in the ballot paper: "Do you agree with Greece's membership of NATO and the EU?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the newly formed countries after the fall of Yugoslavia, is opposed to the name change because of its membership in the EU, NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of our country, for our new generations in Macedonia, for the opportunity to live in the European Union, because this means a safe life for all of us", said Oliver Georgievska, a 79-year-old Skopje resident.
Although not legally binding, a number of members of parliament voted to approve and make it legal.
The change of the country's name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Committee reported that no illegal incidents occurred at noon.
Despite this, turnout has risen to 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I'm here to vote for my children, for our place in Europe", said Gyosse Tanewski, 62, a voter in the Skopje Centre.
In Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dusko took part in a referendum on the name change for Macedonia, which is expected to open the way for Macedonia to become a member of NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was boycotting the referendum and preparing a small picket scene.
"We are not against NATO or the EU, but we must join them, not through the back door of the service, but with our heads up", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to be accepted as Macedonia, then let's join others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership is expected to provide the necessary funding for Macedonia, with the unemployment rate in the country above 20 percent.
"I think most people will agree with this proposal, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said the results of the election with the approval of the president would strengthen our future.
Last Monday, a poll conducted by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in a referendum, which is less than what is needed.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telema TV showed that 57 percent of respondents planned to go to a referendum on Sunday.
And 70 percent of them said yes.
To be considered a successful referendum, you need 50 percent and more votes per vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first major miscalculation of the Western-backed government that has led the country since May.
See: Manchester City Sergio Aguero has passed all of Brighton's defence and scored a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took the defence of Brighton to secure a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in England on Saturday.
Aguero scored in his 65th minute, and it seemed too easy.
The Argentine striker started the line at half-field and passed.
Before they hit the open field, they passed three of Brighton's guards.
Aguero was then surrounded by a player in four green shirts.
One of the guards passed him and he ran faster than the others on the edge of the box.
And then he passed to the left and got your Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch of the box to give it back to Aguero, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and threw the ball to the right of the gate.
"Aguero has a slight foot problem", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
We did.
And that's when the goal was scored.
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the first priority in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep in Brighton.
And the LeRoy on the left is a wonderful ball to the Senators.
Sine led the ball to a small ball and then to a remote pole.
Sky Blues scored a goal just before the forward was eliminated.
City will play in the Champions League group stage against Hoffenheim on Saturday afternoon at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play a game against the Rockies
There was little reason to struggle with another start with their elimination from the national playoffs.
But Sherzer, who has always been a contender, is expected to make a warm-up game against the Colorado Rockies on Saturday, but only if it means a playoff for the Rockies, who are one step ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies won the National Games on Friday 5-2 and were the hardest-hit team to ever win the title, but they're still trying to get to the top division.
We didn't change much if we played, but at least we got to know the atmosphere of support here in Denver and know that the other team was playing at the highest level I've ever seen.
Why didn't I want to play?
The National League is supposed to announce the start on Sunday, but they're telling Scherzer that they're going to give him a chance at that.
Scherzer, who is making his 34th start, plays a bullpen session on Thursday and plays normally on Sunday.
The right-hander from Washington has put up a total of 18-7s this season, giving up 220 2/3 innings with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts.
A tram campaign in West Virginia
The president also spoke about the importance of the Republican Party's victory in the six-month election and his case for the Supreme Court over the election of Brett Kavanaugh.
Everything we do is at risk in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
It's important, I'm not campaigning, but I'm running, so I'm fighting for good candidates everywhere".
"You're seeing a bunch of really bad Democrats, and you've seen what's happening right now", Trump continued.
Have you seen the decisions to use all the means necessary to regain power, cleanliness and evil?
We don't look at who's hurting or who's trampling on to take power and control into our own hands, and we don't give them what they want - power and control.
Democrats, he said, are meant to be non-permissive, to be opposed.
"Do you see, in the last four days", he said, "the Democrats are demonic, perverse, disgusting, and lying".
Speaking about the Senate Judiciary Committee, she spoke on behalf of Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein, and the audience expressed their deep gratitude.
Do you remember the answer?
Did you give the document illegally?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, no, I'm guessing that was the most horrible body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer the people's church.
He Is Opposing His Opinion
My moment was not a surprise when activists shortened my speech at my local party.
After all, a number of Labour Party representatives were angry with the party because we all expressed our views.
My fellow parliamentarian, John Ryan, was treated the same way because he was a staunch anti-Semite.
In my experience, the speech movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and even Jeremy himself, were topics that his former leaders disagreed with.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said, "We wish all the members involved and productive".
This is exactly how meetings were held on Fridays when I was a local Labour Party representative for about eight years.
But today, the nature of mass gatherings is different, and even though the polite, gentle politics were once a thing, they have long since been forgotten.
It is clear that there is no room for opposition in the Labour Party, and that every opinion is not accepted by the party leadership.
It started a little while ago when Jeremy became the leader, and whether it was national security or the EU's common market, my colleagues who had been on the same page before, were expecting me to agree to things that I never agreed to, rather than just accept them.
When I speak to the public, I am constantly being asked on social media to leave the party, to denounce the policies of the centre and to declare that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that's not the only experience I've had.
And to be honest, I'm better at this than some of my colleagues because my views are purely political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who are being racially and sexually vilified every day but never run away.
One of the most frustrating aspects of politics in this era is that bad behavior is normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week expressed the view that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer a church at all, and with every non-religious movement or party-list rule change, the party is shrinking.
For the last two years, I've had a lot of people who have been telling me to keep your head down, and not to mention, "Everything will be fine".
But that's not the purpose of my entry into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, and because I was unhappy with Thatcher's government and my school's classroom was still in a state of complete decline, I've been working to improve the social services of the disabled, whether as a local government official or as a minister, whatever.
I have never hidden my politics from anyone, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could say that my political views and where I disagreed with current leadership were unclear.
I will tell the people who support the movement on Sunday that when our country breaks out and it affects families, businesses and social services, I don't understand how I should waste my energy and time not trusting the leader of the Labour Party.
But I can truly say, not to my Nottingham Moment, but to my constituents, to all of us, whether I am a member of the Labour Party, that I am proud to serve you and that no threat or political attack will ever distract me from my office.
Chris Leslie is the People's Representative for Nottingham East.
Air 38  17 Melrose: The win-win air is up
The last two attempts seem to have altered the final result a little bit, but Ayr, of course, deserved a glorious victory in today's great game of tennis.
Now they're at the top, the only unbeatable part of the top 10.
Right, he had a superior defense, but he used all the chances to back the house, and Peter Murphy had every right to be grateful.
"We've been trying our games before, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be thankful", he said.
Melrose, Robin Christy, said, "They've taken advantage of the air strike better than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute effort was turned by Frazier Climone, who pushed Ear to the front, but the Scottish captain, Rory Hughes, was given a yellow card and the Warriors gave Melrose the opportunity to increase his number, and Jason Baggott challenged the unturned effort.
Climone took the lead with a penalty kick, and in the first half of the game, he beat Air 17-5 in a round-robin solo effort.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's effort, turned by Baggott, reduced the effort by five points.
And then Ruaried made way for a long wait for a serious injury to Knott, a small bump, and at first he moved back to the air, following the climbing efforts of Stafford McDowall.
Air's captain, Blair McPherson, then took the yellow card, and then, once again, Melrose paid off the cash with the unconverted efforts of Bruce Colvin, under extreme pressure.
The home side came back, yes, but Struan Hutchison got a yellow card for hanging out with the ball at Climom, and in the penalty shoot-out, McPherson finished with a crown shot behind the forward ear.
And the climate changed, and he almost started to do it again, and Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's boxing, and he sent Gregor Henry out for the fifth home run.
The Steel Game star seems to have a new career in the restaurant industry
News that the Steel Game star will continue to follow Ford's lead in the hotel industry came out after he was named CEO of the official restaurant company.
Jack Jarvis, 56, stars in the popular BBC show, writes the script himself, and plays alongside his longtime colleague Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last, and it's clear that after Keeran Craigslist, he was planning a new life.
According to official records, he is the CEO of a company called Eadriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a source in Scotch's Sun reported that he was planning to attend a gig at the famous restaurant in Glastonbury, Cairnan.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The naval headquarters in La Paz are guarded by the watermen.
The flags are as blue as the ocean in public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are inscribed with the slogan: "The sea is ours by law".
It's our responsibility to get it back.
In the 19th century, in the landlocked Bolivia, the war with Chile over a coast is still remembered, and the desire to go to the Pacific is still alive.
Their hopes are perhaps higher than in previous years, because Bolivia is awaiting a decision by an international court, which will finally rule on October 1 after five years of continuous solar eclipses.
"We think Bolivia has a legacy, with unity and determination, and we certainly expect the right outcome", said Roberto Calzadailla, the Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are watching the international court's decision nationwide on television, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will decide the case. After years of negotiations, Chile must grant Bolivia an independent maritime route.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, is waiting for the re-election next year to be difficult.
"We're very close to the Pacific Ocean", he promised in August.
But some analysts agree that the court will not support Bolivia, and that even if it does, it will change little.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has said that it cannot make decisions about the territory of Chile, and that it will not decide the outcome of the negotiations.
The International Court's decision to issue a final decision in six months proves that the case is not difficult to solve, said Paz Zarate, a Chilean international lawyer.
And even though it didn't go far enough, it probably did go backwards for the last four years.
The issue of going to sea is being used by the current Bolivian government,  Zarate said.
He suggested that Morales' military promises had destroyed all his good intentions in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile continue to have good talks, but it will be very difficult.
The two countries have not appointed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the suggestion that the court should rule more quickly than usual.
On Monday, Bolivia will open a new era of relations with Chile and bring benefits to both countries, ending 139 years of dissent, he said.
Caldasilla da Morales still disagrees with the view that the most famous Latin American president is using the question of the sea as a political game.
Bolivia will never give up its right to enter the Pacific Ocean.

North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen until the US has trusted it
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that if the nation does not trust Washington, it will never give up its nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly.
The leaders of the two rival countries urged the United States to keep its promises to Singapore.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this when North Korea was about to resume its nuclear diplomacy, which had stalled after a meeting with Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri continued the sanctions and called the US's refusal to declare a final Korean War a "no-fly zone" for the North.
Washington is in no hurry to agree to the declaration until Pyongyang takes serious disarmament steps.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are waiting for a second summit.
But there is also widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang really wants to give up arms, and it seems that it sees its arsenal as the only guarantee of security.
Pompeo will be in Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show recently launched the latest line of headwear that will be coming to your street.
If you want to add new items to your collection of hats or to hide completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne announced a large, diverse line of headwear for their summer, 2019 collections at their stunning fashion show at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, a completely unobtrusive headset covered Instagram, and these designers sent out their stunning work to the public.
The most prominent of Valentino's clothing designs was a wide-brimmed hat, similar to a brown bird's wool, at the top of the model.
Other large accessories included jewelry, a yellow hat, and pineapple, but these do not keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also published a list of interesting Halloween masks.
Most of the masks were colored, and they looked like Hannibal Lecturers, not fireworks.
One headgear was a pair of spectacles and a breathing tube, and the other looked like melting ice.
If you want to be a big fashion star, you have a big one.
Fashion experts expect that hats that will be popular in the streets around you will soon be available.
The two-pound coastal soap hat, La Bomba, was worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Rataykovsky, and it was followed by larger hats.
And then there was this other thing that followed this social media buzz: a big bag that a model could almost wear on a beach with a soap.
A burnt purple bag, with a white belt to hold it, was a highlight of the Jacques La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect the next summer to see big hats and beach handbags on the streets  It's hard not to notice the demand for big accessories because the designer's influence is so strong.'
John Edward: Language is essential for universal citizenship
Independent schools in Scotland are doing great academically, and this is continuing in 2018. Another remarkable test result of schools is that they are further bolstered by individual and social achievements in sports, industry and community activities.
In Scotland, schools with around 30,000 students, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are striving to provide the highest quality services to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for a career of choice, and for their place as citizens of the universe.
As an education sector that plans to implement specially designed school lessons, we see that learning languages today is still a required subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, they'll be at the top of their head.
If you talk to someone in their language, it will stay in their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot communicate with people from other countries by using only English.
And from the latest test results this year, we can see that the students who have taken language lessons in independent schools have passed the highest marks.
68 percent of foreign language students have a high grade of A.
According to data collected by 74 schools in SCIS, 72 percent of students in Chinese, 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent of students in French, and 63 percent of students in Spanish received an A.
This data shows that independent schools in Scotland are going to be very supportive of foreign languages for children and young people in the future.
Languages are as important as STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) lessons in independent schools or anywhere else.
When asked by the UK's Employment Insurance Commission in a 2014 survey why they were restricted from taking up employment, 17 percent said they did not know the language.
The need to learn a language is increasingly needed to prepare young people for a future career.
In a globalized world, learning a foreign language opens up more opportunities for employment.
Whatever career they choose, if they learn a foreign language, they will enjoy the privilege of a lifetime.
Direct communication with foreign visitors can quickly put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
A YouGov survey found that 75 percent of the 4,000 people in England did not speak a foreign language and the top 15 percent spoke French.
So it is important for children to make money to learn a language.
Multilingualism, especially in developed countries, can help children to find better jobs.
In Scotland, the languages taught vary from school to school.
If some schools choose classical modern languages, others may be important in England, teaching languages expected in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, because in independent schools, they can choose any language they want from among several languages, and their teachers are experts in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland strive to provide students with the best possible education, to prepare them for a diverse future and to succeed.
At this time, and certainly in the context of globalization, languages will continue to be important for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, knowing modern languages is an international communication skill.
Independent schools continue to offer these conditions, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
It is good to do.
John Edward  Head of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron is set to make his first start with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday .
The fans had been waiting for LeBron James to play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton James said he will play the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But we still don't know how long he'll play.
"More than once, but less than 48 minutes", Walton Lakers said on the official website.
Lakers secretary Mike Trudell tweeted that James appears to be playing a limited time.
After this week's practice, James was asked about his Lakers plans for six preseason games.
"I don't need pre-season games to be ready for my current career".
Trump's campaign in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is going to start his campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump campaigns to be launched next week, and Tennessee and Mississippi will also stop at places close to him.
The Supreme Court nomination vote is pushed back to a different date, and Trump is planning to build support for the upcoming November midterm elections, because the Republican Party may lose a majority in Congress.
What time is Trump's campaign in West Virginia today, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia, is set for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 PM CST.
You can see Trump's campaign in West Virginia live on YouTube now.
Trump may also announce that he will be hearing Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court this week, which has been postponed for a week pending an FBI investigation into a rape case.
But the first goal of these campaigns is to help give the Republican Party a little more power in the November election.
So Trump's campaign is giving incentives to the candidates and supporters who plan to run five campaigns next week, while the Republican Party is trying to expand its Senate and House majority, reports Reuters.
"The majority of Congress is a very important job for the president, so he's going to visit as many states as possible, and we're going through a very difficult season", said the Trump campaign secretary, but declined to give his name to Reuters.
The campaign that is expected today at the Wesbank Arena in Wheeling will draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and may attract the attention of Pittsburgh news, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
This is the second visit of Trump to West Virginia last Saturday, which he won in 2016 with more than 40 percent of the vote.
Trump is trying to help out the Republican candidate for West Virginia's Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who is a bit behind.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president is coming to help", said Simon Heider, a scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA prepares for Sunday and says we will fight without losing hope
Playing golf in pairs on Saturday after a three-way session may be the thing that Ryder Cup needs.
The power that moves between players is a concept that is largely ignored in sports, but it is something that players actually trust even more in these kinds of competitions.
So who is the power now?
"They were six points ahead, but now they're four points, so we're a little strong", Jordan said at the beginning of the day.
Europe has a lead, of course, with 12 more games, but four points ahead.
Speat says that the Americans think they have a little sweater, and for many reasons, Speat and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, each got three out of four points.
Speat set a fine example in playing hard to get through his youth.
When his time came, the glorious sculptures continued, and the Chekhin tribe reached the four corners, and he and Thomas were two after two.
He also had a 15th-place finish and he said he had a chance in the American team.
If it does, you need to dig deep and think about your match, " said Spieget.
All these players have now quit.
18 holes to get a score.
Speat and Thomas were the players with the most points, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unlikely protagonists of the Ryder Cup.
The interesting but beloved players of Europe are four out of four and they can't make mistakes.
And on Saturday afternoon, there was only one thing that they didn't do, but on Saturday morning, and on Friday afternoon, and on Friday morning, they didn't shoot.
That shot and the energy that flows back and forth from them indicates that they will be hard on Sunday, and that Fleetwood or Molinari Lou Golf are the only players in the NFL with the most famous chance of winning at sunset.
Both are in the same hole at the same time.
The European glory is still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short work on the four main characters of the morning, Sergio Garcia, with Alec Noren.
They never got out of the top nine in singles and doubles, with Spanish and Swedish in the hole.
No one helps us out of the hole on Sunday.
It's great to watch four teams and two or two play golf, because the way people play together, the advice or the strategy of the same team can change in a moment.
Europe had played better as a team, and it made a significant advance in the last day, but this was rejected by those who doubted that the American team could play a decent game in a two-by-two golf match, especially those who doubted Stetsey.
Europe defeating the Ryder Cup 10-6 on the final day
On the final day of the European Ryder Cup, the United States took a 10-6 lead in the four-team and two-two golf match on Saturday.
The power duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the struggling Tiger Woods to two wins, their best result coming in the La Golf National in four points.
Thomas Björn, the European side, competed to regain the loot lost two years ago at Hazel, defeating the American side 3-1 in the morning in the tough four.
In a two-to-two golf game, the U.S. offered more opponents, won two games, but couldn't make it to the semifinals.
To avoid a boost, Jim Furyk needed eight points from 12 matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood became the first European to win four straight, and Molinari became the second couple in Ryder Cup history to win four in their first four matches.
Woods and Patrick Reed won four games, and Woods and American player Bryson DeShambo were beaten 5-4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday, was sometimes a great player, but he's now lost seven straight four-balls to two-two in a golf game, 29 of 19 games.
Justin Rose, after a break in the morning four, returned to his partner Henry Stenson, defeating the world number one and third-place Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, 2-1.
Europe did not win as much as they wanted, but it was a cool, pleasant day in the south of Paris.
Three-time major winners, Jordan Speat and Justin Thomas, set a tough example for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They lost 2-1 to John Ram and Jan Polter of Spain, and then they beat Paulter and Rory McIroy 4-3 and came back, but they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have a team lost four points to one game, even if it takes a little effort to beat the other side.
But after two days as the second-best, the Sunday counterattack is expected to be more difficult.
North Korea says that a party without faith will not disarm
North Korea's foreign minister said the continued sanctions on the United Nations on Saturday were deepening distrust of the United States and that under such conditions the country would never surrender nuclear weapons.
At the annual UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken some important steps last year, including halting nuclear and military testing, eliminating nuclear testing areas, and promising to not develop nuclear weapons and technology.
But we didn't get a decent response from the US, he said.
Without any trust in the United States, there will never be any trust in national security, and under these conditions, disarmament is impossible for us.
While Ri repeated the same lines of protest that Washington had made against North Korea's gradual nuclear disarmament, (which would be rewarded for every step North Korea took over Washington), his words were important because Pyongyang had not rejected unilateral nuclear disarmament as it had before.
Lee Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump spoke at their first summit together, and the North Korean leader promised in Singapore on June 12 that Kim Jong-un would work to disarm the Korean peninsula, and Trump would be the guarantor of North Korea's security.
North Korea was seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insisted that Pyongyang should first provide its nuclear weapons.
Washington did not rush to lift the international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is demanding first disarmament to achieve its goal of forced entry, and increasing pressure to impose sanctions and refuse to declare an end to the war", said Ri.
The idea that sanctions can affect us is a dream of a nation that knows nothing about us.
The problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our distrust.
And Lee didn't mention his plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which Trump had mentioned at the United Nations a week ago.
The minister instead noted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, saying, "If this disarmament issue had been resolved, not by South Korea, not by the United States, disarmament on the Korean Peninsula would not have been a dead end".
But what Ri said was very different from what he said last year at the UN: "Bad Mr. President Trump, after calling Kim a suicide bomber, North Korea has a plan to launch a missile into the United States, and the General Assembly should be fooled into thinking that he has a plan.
This year at the United Nations, Trump threatened to "terminate" North Korea last year, praising Kim for taking the step to disarmament, but saying there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions should remain until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have time for this, and it didn't matter if it took two years, three years, or five months.
China and Russia discussed the UN, and the Pyongyang Security Council should reward the measures taken.
Nevertheless, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The security council's sanctions must be upheld vigorously and continuously until we reach a complete, final and verified disarmament".
The Security Council has increased its sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in a bid to halt Pyongyang's funding of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a good one.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that he had achieved only one success for North Korea, within an hour of testing his gangster claims".
North Korea, at its meeting with Moon, promised to disengage the missile facility and the nuclear complex if the United States took the necessary measures".
He said Kim was looking for the "comprehensive measures" Trump promised when he was in Singapore, security guarantees, and he was eager to restore relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course to get enough rest
This year, the new course has forced all Harvard students to sleep more overnight in an effort to combat a culture of caffeine-induced anxiety".
The number one academic university in the world has revealed that students are not educated on how to provide basic care for themselves.
Charles Chessler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Women's Hospital and the Brian Hospital, believes that he has developed the best, independent course in the United States.
After giving a talk about the effect of sleep on reading, she was inspired to start the course.
'Finally, a girl came to me and said, 'Why did I learn about this just now, in my senior year?
He told me that no one had ever told me about the importance of sleep, and he said, "I was surprised".
This year's first-ever course, a good sleeping habits, explained to students how it helps them learn and exercise, and also improves their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's Health Services Department, said that he decided to start the course after learning that students had been sleeping for a week.
The one-hour course itself includes a series of interactive assignments.
In one section, a picture of the dorm is shown, where students choose coffee cups, curtains, coaches, and books to talk about caffeine and light, and they read about how sports can affect sleep deprivation, and how sleep is important.
In another section, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation may increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The interactive signs and the campus map will encourage participants to reflect on their daily lives.
'We know that students' behavior does not change in an instant.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the harmful effects of smoking,' Professor Chessler added.
"There is still a proud culture of working all night", he added, "and the growing problem of sleep deprivation is reflected in the constant pressure on students and technology".
He said that adequate and quality sleep should be a tool for the student to deal with stress, weight loss, anxiety, and not fattening, because sleep deprivation can cause the brain to starve and make the person hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who was studying chemistry and body biology, helped Professor Chase develop his course last year, taking a class of professors during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that this course opened his eyes and inspired the whole campus to take a course.
The next step is hopefully to invite all graduates to complete a similar program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chessler suggested that students set a wake-up clock to calculate their sleep and sleep time, taking into account the harmful effects of light-diode displays and electronic screens, which can interfere with your daily rhythm by getting too much sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: I was removed from Gerrard ' s man
As a guest, the Rangers suffered another stroke, and Dolly Mengi's stroke passed to the madman, Stephen Gerrard, and they lost to Livingston 1-0.
The Aybrokes hoped to win their first game after a 4:1 victory at St Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team struck Gerarddo in the second as manager in the 18th game to leave eight points to their side in the Ladbrokes Hearts Premier League lead.
And I sent the ball to the Rangers with seven minutes left to play, and the Rangers were not able to tie.
In that time, Rangers came in sixth, and Livingston was only behind Hibernian in scoring, and he was promoted to third.
Ranger was also in trouble, and some object had touched the head of Abrit Calum Spence from a distance, so he had to treat his head.
Gerrard made eight substitutions for Ayr, who was on his way to the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was leading the Livi 11 with the same Heart score last week, and he was excited that his well-trained team was playing their opponents every step of the way.
Maybe Rangers dominated the field, but Livingston managed the ball as much as he could.
They were going to score in two minutes, and the first leg of the game was played at McGregor's gate, and they were sent to Scott Pittman, but the halfback missed the convenient moment.
Keegan Jacobs' strong penalty kick found the team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to get to the back of the grid.
The Rangers took two chains, one list, but in the final third there was more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos and Stephen Lawless were in a fight, but when referee Stephen Thomson was fired from the Colombian appeal, he felt Morelos should have had a quarter-hour penalty.
The Rangers only hit the goal in the first half with two strokes, with the head of former Aybrokse goalkeeper Liam Kelly, and the head of Owy's goal.
Levi's 34th-minute goal at that time may be a challenge to the game, because no one can deny that they were bribed.
Again, the Rangers failed to match Jacobs' set-up.
Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was trying to knock out Menna for a simple finish, but Scott Arfield did not respond.
He replaced Culibalini with Ryan Kent, and Gerrard tried the canvas, and the change was effective in a short time, at least the forward collided with Morelos, but, to his surprise, Kelly ran away because he blocked his line.
But Livingston, Lithgow, and Helket cleaned the ball up and invited the guests to their favorite game.
In the final stages, Holt might have taken their lead, but until Lithgow hit the ball from a wide angle with his head, McGregor held a good position to block Jacobs.
Ranger's replacement Glenn Middleton filed a late penalty claim, and he finally collided with Jacobs, but Thompson turned around again.
The Almahnhache Congregation: The inventor of the Geiger calculator
And now, this morning of the market, a page from our almanac: 136 years ago today, on September 30, 1982, this day, in Germany, the future physicist Johann Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for measuring and demonstrating radioactivity, and this invention led to the creation of the famous Geiger calculator.
Since then, Geiger's calculator has become the basis of pop culture, as have the unsubstantiated scientist-cowboy Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the 1950s film The Coronation Bell:
The man said, "Where did this come from?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger's calculator, which is used to show radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear an earpiece, you can hear the effect of atoms on the radioactive material".
Evans said, "He's just going to shoot!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention bears his name.
A new vaccine against cancer can stimulate the immune system to detect foreign cells
A new vaccine against cancer will stimulate the immune system to detect and kill foreign cells
As part of the treatment, vaccines teach the immune system to recognize foreign cells
This method involves removing immune cells from the patient by re-engineering them in the lab.
They can see a protein that looks like a lot of cancers.
A subsequent trial of the vaccine will show the long-awaited results of treatment for a number of cancer-related diseases.
A woman who received the vaccine, which taught her immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing the patient's immune cells and detecting proteins similar to many types of cancer called HER2, then modifying them in the lab and reinserting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzowski, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, USA, said, "Our results have shown that we have the most promising vaccine".
HER2 controls the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and bowel cancers, says Professor Berzowski.
This method, such as removing and killing immune cells from patients, has also been targeted at cancer cells and has also worked to treat various types of leukemia.
Kanye West, on Saturday Night Live, (SNL) after his speech, wore a mask to defend his bitter speech about Trump.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was only heard during Saturday Night Live, when he made a speech that was uncomfortable with his unrelated praise of the United States. President Donald Trump announced that he would run for president again in 2020.
Kanye West, wearing a mask that said "Make America Great", sang a third song called Ghost Town, and spoke out against the Democrats and supported Trump.
"I've interviewed actors many times, and they keep asking me, 'What do you like about Trump? Is he a racist?'
If racism were to worry me, I would never leave America".
SNL started the show with a parody of Matt Damon, who mocked the testimony of the Hollywood star Matt Damon, and of Brett Kavanaugh, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual assault of Christensen Blaze Ford.
And while it didn't work out, the video footage of Kanye West's speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Chris Rock's posting of the video was a mockery.
In addition, West told the audience that he had heard bad words because he had worn a hat on the outside of his curtain.
"They did not encode me, nor did they give me peace.
They said, 'Don't wear this cloak and go on stage.'
They made fun of me!
And they told me that you were where you went".
West went on to say, "Do you want to see where he's gone? " I mean, I'm wearing a superman suit because that means you can't tell me what I'm going to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Then love yourself".
His speech was accompanied by at least two unpopular screams, and the staff of Saturday Night TV were not sure what to do.
West was invited to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier, and he was unable to attend.
West performed a song called "I Like It" dressed as a Perrier bottle, and it surprised many.
And I got a call from the conservative organization West Puget Sound, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "Thank you for standing on a rock, thank you for your courage".
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted, "West just happened to be who he is, and that's great!"
"But I decided not to reward anyone who supported an ideology that hurt my community (by buying his songs, or buying his clothes, or supporting his art).
He is a free man.
He added that he was a free man just like us.
At the beginning of the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and he is now officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and also plays famous Diddins like Puff Daddy, Puffy, P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, changed his name to Snoop Lion, and the legendary Prince, who was also a musician, changed his name to the symbol, and then again to Prince, who was known as "The Prince".
Accused of murder in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with stabbing to death at a restaurant in east Belfast on Sunday.

The prosecution is the prosecutor's office.
Trickets star of the series Keith Harington is one of the stronger men
Keith Harington is best known for his role as John Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series, The Wicked Witch of the West.
But the 31-year-old actor says that when young people see the roles on screen, they often think they have to be tough to respect them.
In a speech to The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that "something went wrong" and asked how to address the overwhelming courage problem of the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old star in the series, admitted that she felt too strong to be successful in this overly overly courageous issue.
He said that I personally felt sharp enough to see where we were doing the wrong thing.
In view of the situation we are facing today, when did we make a mistake in raising our children?
Keith believes that television may also be responsible for the growth of his over-indulgent heroic personality.
And he goes on to say, "What is in this world that is natural and what is out there that is natural?"
What do the television and the street teach children to make them feel like a certain type of man?
I think this is the only really serious problem we have right now. How do we solve this problem?
Because there's really something wrong with young children.
In an interview, he also announced that he would no longer be making any prequels or sequels after the end of the series Tax Games in the summer.
Starting in November, Keith will play in Sam Shepard's True West, a game about a film producer and his thieving uncle.
He said that meeting his wife Rose at the Game of Thrones was the best part of his career.
"I met my wife on this show, and with it, I created my future family and my life".
In the Emmy-nominated fantasy series, John Snow's lover, played by Rose Keith, played the character of Igrit.
The couple got married in June 2018 in Lesley, Scotland.
HIV: China reports 14% of new cases.
China reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials report that more than 820,000 people in the country are affected by these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, there were about 40,000 new cases.
Most of them are sexually transmitted, which is a change in statistics from last year.
In some parts of China, HIV spread rapidly as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province that the number of people infected with HIV had been reduced to almost zero.
But in China, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 a year.
Sexual transmission of AIDS is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but they say that LGBT discrimination continues.
In light of the country's age-old values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many diseases are transmitted by misconceptions about sexual matters.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make HIV drugs publicly available as part of its efforts to address these problems.
Maxine Waters has denied the recent conspiracy theories and the dangerous false information that has been leaked by Republican Party senators.
On Saturday, the C.S. Representative, Maxine Waters, accused a member of the staff of posting three personal information about U.S. Republican senators on the legislator's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were made by politicians and the website.
"Lies, lies, and even more hateful lies", Waters wrote on Twitter.
The release states that the phone numbers and home addresses of the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch  both from Utah.
On Thursday, while the Senate Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh was being charged with sexual offences, an unknown person on Capitol Hill leaked information online.
The news only came after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have released information from Waters officials that the IP address is linked to Waters' office, which identified the source of the messages, The Hill reports.
"This uncertain statement is completely false and absolutely false", Waters continued.
"My staff member, whose privacy, personal information, and security are compromised by fraudulent and false claims, is not responsible for any breach of trust.
This is a vague statement that is completely false and absolutely false".
Waters's application was quickly criticized on the Internet, as was the White House's former press secretary, Ari Fletcher.
"This is an angry rejection", wrote Fletcher.
"This is a sign that he has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of a wrong he should not be angry.
They do not have to be rude.
They should not allow the accuser to question his motives.
They need to be calm and calm".
I think that Fletcher compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of the Kavanaugh judge, who was very angry during the Thursday hearing.
Republican Party candidate Omar Navarro, who has also cast his ballot for the midterm elections, tweeted his opinion.
"Serious, if true", he tweeted.
In his filing, Waters warned his office of these fraudulent claims to the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies.
"We will bring the guilty to justice", he continued, "and they will be held liable for their actions, which will be dangerous and outrageous to all members of my staff".
Johnny Innisch hits again - a spy novel by not so powerful Rowan Atkinson
Now, the meaning of Brexit can be seen in any new film with a British genre, and this is also the name of the Johnny Innis re-release of the action-comedy franchise, which started in 2003 and then returned to theaters in 2011 with the rebirth of Johnny Innis.
Can self-deprecating satire be a new export opportunity for the country?
And at any given moment, Johnny Innisch, with his big, rubber-faced eyes, returns for the second time, and the name of the actor who played Johnny Innisch, means that this is the signal for the best comedy, and the most interesting movie in the territory of a non-English speaking audience.
He was a silly secret agent, of course, but despite his ridiculous demands for glamorous smoothies, he took a little Cluz, played Mr. Bean, and played a single note to the tune of "Around the World" in London in 2012.
It was also founded by Atkinson, an international mystery and traveler who had played a part in the now-forgotten Barlycard TV show, leaving behind the chaos.
There are one or two good moments in the last Johnnie Inglis trip.
I liked that Johnny Ennis, wearing a medieval sauna, would whistle from the top of the helicopter's sling while approaching the helicopter.
Atkinson's gift is demonstrated as physical comedy, but the lack of humor seems to be poor and excessive, especially with the popular 007 and Mission Failure films, where comedy is now credibly recommended as an ingredient.
I think humor is more for young children than for adults, and the bad stories of Johnny Enlis are less than as good as the ones of the Atkinson Deaf film, Bob's Prick.
The United Kingdom is in a serious disaster.
By exposing all the British agents in this area, the cyber-hacker has infiltrated the UK's top-secret network and has taken the agent's heart, a sad little role for Kevin Elldon.
This is the final straw for a haughty, unpopular prime minister who is not known as a politician, but who suffers a complete defeat: this quasi-Theresa-May, Emma Thompson, who does everything possible, but there is no exception to the script.
His intelligence advisers had to send someone to resign because every active spy had a bad reputation.
And this is the story of Johnny Enlisch, who was a school teacher at some wonderful institution, but he taught informal lessons on how to be a secret agent, and this is a good joke, like Enlisch is going to suggest a spy academy that looks like rock.
Ennis returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and joins his long-suffering ex-boyfriend, Ben Miller, who is playing again.
Boff is now married to the captain of a submarine named "Jolie-Hockey-Clows", and he's a bit of a loser in the role of Vicky Pepperdine.
After making a big mistake in the Secret Service of the Grand Master, Batman and Robin returned to the business, until they met the influential Olga Kurilenko  Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being terrorized by the charismatic British billionaires who solve the computer problems, and Jake Lacy plays the role of the black billionaire Jason Volta.
Ennis and Boff begin their audition with their own senseless jokes: dressed as waiters, they burn down a French restaurant; create a mess on board the elegant yacht of Volta; and Ennis attempts to use a virtual headset to create a pure anarchy to explore the interior of Volta's home.
All the effort was made for the final episode, of course, but as pleasant and annoying as it was, there was enough children's television in it.
Enough staff to stop.
Like many other films by Johnnie Inglis, I couldn't help but wonder, how could the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson the talented role he deserves?
Labour denies that they are working a plan for four days a week, but five days a week for the British.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan where British people work four days a week but get paid for five days.
The party has reportedly requested that the leaders of the companies transfer the deposits of the revolutionary AI to the workers, indicating an extra day off.
The result is that the workers enjoy three days of rest, but each one receives the same salary.
The sources said the idea was part of the party's economic agenda and that the country was being targeted for workers' benefit.
The shift to a four-day workweek was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way to use the benefits of a changing economy for workers.
The Labour Party's top party told The Sunday Times: 'A political review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
It's not an hour, but a four-day workweek is a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, a workweek, and a workweek, and a workweek, and a workweek, and a workweek, and a workweek, and a workweek, and a workweek, and a workweek, and a week.
The Labour Party was not the first to support this idea, but the Green Party announced a four-day work week in 2017 during its campaign.
But the Labour Party generally does not support this effort.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day workweek is not party policy and is not considered by the party'
Chancellor of the Exchequer John MacDonnell used a Labour conference last week to articulate his views on the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the directors and speculators of the utilities who were not his type.
The plans of the Chancellors of the Exchequer also explain the possibility that the current shareholders of the clow companies may not be able to recover all their shares because the Labour government may carry out the withdrawal on the basis of alleged breaches.
It also approved plans to create an inclusive ownership fund to incorporate employees into the boards of directors of companies and to give employees 10% of the shares of private firms that receive dividends of up to £500 a year.
Lindsay Graham, John F. Kennedy, for "60 Minutes", and the FBI investigator says that Kavanaugh is going to change his mind.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating the latest indictment of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court has postponed the vote on her candidacy by at least a week, and the FBI's findings may influence Republican senators to support them.
In an interview on Sunday, reporter Scott Pelly of 60 Minutes asked Republicans, John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, if the FBI could come up with something that would force them to change their decision.
Kennedy, from South Carolina, was much more open than his colleague.
Kennedy said, "Of course".
"I told him I was going to the hearing, and I told him I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
After that, I called him and asked, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, determined".
Graham's voice sounds like a stone carved.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and it's going to be a dynamite charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett was definitely making this up", and Graham added, taking into account Christine Blaze Ford.
"At least those who know it cannot prove it.
He is 36 years old.
I saw nothing new".
What is the World Citizens' Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the World Citizens Festival takes place in New York City, and every year, a musical event brings together an impressive cast of stars and also accomplishes an impressive mission: eradicate poverty in the world.
This seventh annual World Citizens' Festival has gathered tens of thousands of people in Central Park, not only to enjoy the great singers Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but to learn about the true purpose of the festival - to eradicate poverty in the world by 2030.
The 2012 Global Civil Festival is a continuation of the Global Civil Festival on Poverty Alleviation, an international media campaign launched to combat poverty by increasing the number of active people.
To get a free ticket (if you're not willing to buy a VIP ticket) you have to do a series of awareness raising tasks, and volunteer, email, phone calls, or other important ways to get to the world's leaders.
But how successful has the Global Citizens' Festival been 12 years before its goal was achieved?
Is the free gift of tickets to the concert audience an invitation to fight against real poverty, or is it just another example of "click activism" - do people really feel that they are changing things by just petitioning online or tweeting?
Since 2011, the Global Citizens' Festival has inspired more than 19 million supporters to take action for a variety of purposes.
It says that these actions have helped global leaders to announce commitments and policies worth over $37 billion, which are expected to impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to at least $10 billion in previously paid or withdrawn funds, including 390 commitments and applications arising from its activities.
The estimated resources available today have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key responsibilities include a partnership with Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and executive that promises to give Rwandan $35 million to help stop the famine after more than 4,700 tweets.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens, we can make social injustice the first thing in history", said Tracy Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the 'Power of Food' project, which includes about 5 million women and children through nutrition-related activities.
And answer one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
 A global citizen responded, "It's going to be a long and complicated journey  sometimes we fall and lose.
But the great civil rights movements that preceded us are as difficult as we are, and we will succeed because we are strong in unity.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janel Mona will be speaking at an event in New York City this year, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US Navy could use Russian exports of energy-efficient materials for export", the Interior Minister said.
Washington could rely on the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East, if necessary, said Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, writes the Washington Examiner.
Zinker argues that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially where it is working at the invitation of its legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"They're in the Middle East because they want to trade energy like Eastern Europe, like Southern Europe", he said.
And the service representative says that there are ways and methods to solve this problem.
"The United States has the ability to use our Navy to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, to reduce their energy flow to the market".
Zinké addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumers' Energy Alliance, who described themselves as the "voice of the energy consumer" of the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran and said they were equally effective.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is to use and replace fuel in a small amount", he said, noting that Russia's economy is dependent on fossil fuels and that it has no other resource.
The Trump administration is working on a solution to the problem of exporting liquefied gas to Europe and supplying Europe's consumers with cheaper energy instead of Russia.
To achieve this, officials from the Trump administration, as well as US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany that Trump has "conquered" Berlin by "making it" a "no place" for Moscow to exit the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project.
The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which costs $11 billion, has been repeatedly mentioned in Moscow as a clean economic project that will increase the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters.
According to the Kremlin, Washington's fierce opposition to the project is economically motivated and an example of unfair competition.
After meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September, "We believe that energy should not be a tool for pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers", said Alexander Novak, Russia's energy minister.
Germany, which confirmed its support for the project, reacted negatively to the US position.
The German Federation of Industries (BDI), Germany's leading industrial organization, urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
After the last meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) Dieter Kempf said, "The interference of a third party country in our energy supply issues is a big problem for me".
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is preparing to run for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be preparing for the midterm elections.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said that he was considering running.
"It's time for women, including the woman above, to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government", he wrote in The Hill.
"I am preparing to run for office after November 6".
During the regional meeting, Warren said President Donald Trump was "leading the region in the wrong direction".
"I'm really worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has publicly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Sunday, Warren tweeted that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation must check before it can be released".
But the vote announced on Thursday showed that Warren's constituents don't think he should run in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Center for Policy Research/Boston Global Voting, "possible" Massachusetts voters say a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported his candidacy.
The vote resulted in a stronger vote for former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% voted in favor of him and 48% voted against him.
The 2020 election debate also included the names of other prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will make his decision in January.
At a rally with Donald Trump , Sarah Palin spoke about the post-traumatic stress disorder that Trace Palin had .
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday evening, she was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"I can tell you what my son has not experienced, what he has experienced since he came back, how many other families have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, and how many soldiers have returned injured", he told a crowd at a protest against Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his son's arrest was a big problem and that his son and other veterans "come back a little different, they come back strong, and the fellow soldiers, the pilots and every member of the military wonder if there's such a grateful spirit for what they've done for the country".
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence against a woman, based on a report by Dan Bennett, a police officer in Wasilla, that he was a victim of domestic violence and was drunk.
18 states and the District of Columbia have voted in favor of a new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have supported a new U.S. legal appeal against the new U.S. policy of banning asylum for victims of domestic violence and escape.
According to NBC News, representatives from 18 states and counties in Washington on Friday wrote a letter in support of asylum seekers as "counselors of the courts".
The full name of the opponent is Grace V. Sessions, who is accused of being an unpublished American civil liberties organization in August's federal lawsuit.
She was abused by her boyfriend and "her violent gangster children", but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which had been given asylum in the United States for many years, as the most violent countries in the world for bandits and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy reversed a decision in 2014 by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed for the removal of undocumented immigrants from domestic violence.
In a statement Friday, the District of Columbia's Attorney General, General Carl Rassepp, said that the new policy "is ignoring decades of government, federal, and international law".
"Federal law requires that all requests for asylum be made in the light of the facts or circumstances of the request, and this prohibition is contrary to that principle",  the court said in a statement.
Lawyers say that immigration bans are damaging to the U.S. economy because immigrants often do business or "provide the necessary labor force".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an order to immigration courts to stop providing asylum to victims of domestic violence or gang violence.
"The country can be a refuge for people who are discriminated against on grounds of race, religion, national identity, or persecution for their political or social affiliation", the session said in a policy statement on July 11.
Refugees are not designed to solve all the problems that people around the world face in their daily lives.
The number of deaths during the search for survivors in the forced rescue efforts on the bridge has doubled
The situation for the survivors became increasingly dangerous.
"It's very difficult", said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while comforting her agitated child in the devastated evacuation center of the city of Palú.
"Every minute, the ambulance was bringing bodies.
There is not enough clean water".
The residents returned to their homes and searched for the items that had been submerged, trying to save at least a small amount.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospital was completely empty when it was hit by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
Some of the wounded, including the broken hip and shoulder, were in the Army Hospital of Dwy Harris-Palow, where many of the patients were bathing in the open air.
When he remembered the earthquake in the room he was staying in with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of his hotel, his tears filled his eyes.
"We had no time to save ourselves.
I feel like I'm stuck between the broken walls", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife cry for help one day, and then she calmed down.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I pray that they are safe".
A US official accused China of "joking" with propaganda.
After the official Chinese newspaper in the United States published a weekly four-page ad about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador in Beijing accused China of using the American press to spread propaganda.
After accusations that the United States is interfering with China's November 6 congressional elections (which China denies the allegation), President Donald Trump last week cited a paid supplement to China Daily's "Register in Des Moines", Iowa's largest newspaper retailer.
Beijing's alleged election meddling in the US, according to US officials, is a new stage in US pressure on China.
Advertising for other countries to promote is commonplace, but Beijing and Washington are in the process of ending their trade wars, and as a result, they are imposing the same tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts say that the new tariffs introduced by China at the beginning of the trade war were intended to hurt states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party.
U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, one of the largest exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had caused great damage to American workers, farmers, or businessmen.
In a Sunday paper, The Des Moines, Branstad said that China "is making a mockery of this ridicule by advertising in our free newspaper".
"By paying DeMone to run ads, China is spreading propaganda using America's longing for free speech and free press", Bransdard wrote.
"And here in Beijing, there are very few people who think differently, and you don't see any contradictions that reflect the Chinese's real view of China's worrying economic direction, because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that his article was "One of China's leading newspapers refused to publish it", but did not say which.
After the fall of Kavanaugh, Republicans eliminated women voters before the midterm, analysts warn.
Analysts warn that despite multiple sexual assault claims, many Republican Party members remain out of the race and support the candidacy of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this were so strong that many members of the Republican Party expressed their desire to continue voting.
These events cannot be reversed", said Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Richer said that Senator Jeff Fleye of Arizona was not convinced at the last minute that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating enough to keep voters on the floor.
"Women are not ready to forget what happened yesterday, not tomorrow, even in November", said Karin Jean-Pierre, chief counsel and national representative for the progressive movement MoveOn, a Washington-based newspaper in the District of Columbia, on Friday.
On Saturday morning, the protesters sang "November is Coming", and Mic reported that members of the Republican Party, who were running the Judiciary Committee, sang this song in the Senate lobby despite the direction of Dr. Christine Blassy Ford, when they wanted to warm up and move forward with the elevation of Kavanaugh.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are growing beyond what is normal", said political scientist Steve Rothenberg, who is not a member of any political party.
"People say it was already high, and it's true.
But it may be even higher, especially among women voters in the inner city and among voters 18 to 29 years of age younger who don't vote for the president, even if they don't approve of it".
Until Ford publicly accused the Supreme Court's nominee of sexual assault, analysts speculated that the Republicans could be held liable if they presented evidence.
According to NBC News, earlier last week, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said, "It was a mess and a mess for the Republican Party".
"It's not just about a speech or a final vote or a Kavanaugh lawsuit, it's about how Republicans are dealing with it and how they're dealing with it", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helped elect Democrats.
Yet, after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, Americans are divided into two groups, and a little over half of them support Kavanaugh.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41 percent of respondents believe in the truth or falsity of Ford's testimony, and 35 percent believe in the truth or falsity of Kavanaugh.
At the same time, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh was either a fake or a fake in his presentation, and another 30 percent said that Ford was.
Following the Flake attack, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating the murder of Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford took the oath of office to the Senate Judiciary Committee and testified that Kavanaugh was drunk and assaulted at the age of 17.
Ramirez said that in the 1980s, a candidate for the Supreme Court was a student at Yale University, and he showed her his genitals at a party.
The inventor of the world wind is going to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wind, is starting a new startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a Berners-Lee Solid open platform company.
Solid allows users to choose where they are stored and which data can be accessed by which people.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee Inrupt joked that the goal was "global dominance".
"We have to do this now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The application uses Solid technology, which helps people create their own personal online data store, or POD.
It contains a list of contacts, a list of activities, an annual, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all in one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal online store is that it's entirely up to the user to access any data.
The company called it "the personal extension of rights and opportunities through websites".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the main goal of Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, and an organization of several state-owned programmers and volunteer programmers who have signed up to work on the project.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "didn't talk to Facebook or Google about introducing news that would change their business models instantly.
"We did not ask their permission".
In a statement published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee Inrupt wrote, "The mission of this Solid is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new wind power built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee created the World Wind Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and he changed the Internet.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over neutrality on the Internet.
Even after starting Inrupt, Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this next era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Minister of the Holy Victoria Cross during World War I
The only pope of the Church of England who fought in World War I, won the Victoria Cross, and this event was celebrated in his city for the first time in 100 years.
The Honorable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the Medal for the attack on Bellenglish and Leucor on 29 September 1918.
But four days later, he was killed by a sniper, and he did not know that he had received Britain's highest honor.
During a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday, a monument was presented to two of his grandchildren.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the stone was found 100 years after his grandfather was honored and made it a "true symbol".
According to the London Times, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion through the St. Canton Canal "in a thick fog and in the rain of field guns and machine guns".
He then turned against the shots, "with great courage" led his troops forward, and with one hand he threw down the field weapon, destroying three battalions.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, about a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said of his grandfather, "I cannot do such a thing, and I am ashamed of it".
He and his uncle, Dr. James Vann, laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann added: "It is an honor to be part of this parade", and "the support of so many people proves that Grandpa is a true hero".
MMA fans were up all night, waiting for Bellator 206, but instead they watched the cartoon Toropey Peppa.
Imagine being up all night watching Bellator 206, but not having this long-awaited event.
The match in San Jose was 13 matches, including six matches on the main card, and the match was broadcast live on five channels across the UK overnight.
At 6 a.m., while Geogard Mussey and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet, the British audience was shocked to see Trophy Peppa on screen.
Those who waited until dawn to fight felt bad.
One of the Twitter fans called the children's programming into a cartoon "a sick joke".
"The government decided that at 6 a.m. it was not appropriate to show the content, so I had to switch to a children's program",  said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the admissions.
"'Torothy Peppa, yes".
Scott Cocker, president of Bellator, said they plan to create a schedule to add the audience to the network in the future.
"I think we can solve this problem when we play the next game", said Cocker.
"But now it's Saturday morning, and we can't fix it until Sunday, which is only Monday.
But we're working on it.
And believe me, when it was translated, there were many back and forth texts, and not all of them were pleasant.
We tried to fix it, but we thought it was a technical failure.
But it was not, it was a state problem.
And believe me, this will not happen again.
We're going to cut it down to five fights instead of the usual six fights, and we're going to try to help the fans, but it's not working.
This is the exception".
Discs on the desert island: Tom Daley felt sexually unpleasant
Olympic diver Tom Daley felt bad about his sexuality  but it motivated him to succeed.
I didn't realize that "everything is different" until I was in high school.
Speaking on the first CD of Radio 4 Desert Island, commissioned by Lauren Laverne, she said that they shared ideas about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that after becoming a father, he had given up thinking about winning the Olympics.
For many years, the show's constant host, Christie Young, took several months off due to illness.
Daily, who played the lead role in Laverne's program, said that "loving boys and girls is not acceptable to society" and that he felt "comparatively incomplete" with others.
He said: "Until that day, I felt that I was not perfect and that I was different, and that gave me the strength to succeed".
She said she wanted to prove that she was "one thing", because she thought that when people knew about her sexuality, they would support her.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is a prominent LGBT activist who used her performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries to recognize homosexuality as a crime.
He said that his life was open and without consequences, and he felt that he was successful and wanted to give others "hope".
American director Dustin Lance Black, who met the three-time world champion in 2013, said that my falling in love was "a surprise".
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than her, but she said age difference was never a problem.
"He's had so many challenges at such a young age"  He went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, and he says it's hard to find someone of that age who's had so many good things and challenges.
The couple had a child in June named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and he said that "my whole outlook" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would have said, 'I just need to win a gold medal.'"
"You know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son, Robert, was named after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at age 40.
Daly said that his father had refused to accept his death and that one of his dying remarks was about the 2012 London game, and he asked if he had a ticket and he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not in the front row.'"
"I held his hand when he was breathing out and he was breathing out and I finally knew that when he was gone, he was not defeated".
The following year, in 2012, Daly competed in the Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I realized that wearing a dress in front of my people at the Olympics was something I'd always wanted to do, because there was no better feeling than that", she said.
It also inspired me to choose Proud by Heather Small, the first song that inspired the Olympics and still shakes my body.
The records on the Isle of Wight will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Saturday at 11:15 (London time).
Mickelson , who was in a bad shape , was not in a seat at the Ryder Cup on Saturday .
Phil Mickelson, an American, set a new record for the 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he had to get back in shape to avoid losing that match.
Mickelson was a two-year starter on the 12th, and was suspended by Captain Jim Furyk during Saturday's game.
The five-way winner of the Deméde in America, who has always attracted the public's attention, spent the day as a fan and working on the game on the field to correct his mistakes.
Even at the height of his career, a 48-year-old driver who was not a straight-forward driver could not drive as well on the long-distance Le Golf National.
Although the track itself is not so dangerous, on Sunday, Mickelson will face the British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match, who will be joined by Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who have scored four goals in 12 single games, start their new game well, Mickelson's game could be the deciding factor.
Furyk said he believed in his man, and he said nothing else.
"He understood the role of today, found my hand, hugged me, and told me I'd be ready tomorrow", said Furich.
"She has a lot of confidence.
He's a Hall of Fame fan himself, and he's contributed a lot to these teams, last week and this week.
I never saw him play in two games.
I had a lot of ideas, but this is what happened, and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else".
Mickelson broke Nick Faldon's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could have meant the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never matched his personal records.
According to Fury, Mickelson's presence brought non-material assets to the tribe, and Mickelson finished with 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven ties.
"He likes to be funny, he likes to make jokes, he's smart and he likes to make fun of people and he can be a great member of any tribe", she said.
"That week, the young players were very interested in seeing his game, and it was really exciting.
He gave more than just a game".
European captain Thomas Björn realizes that his prime privilege may soon be lost
European captain Thomas Björn knows from his experience that the ultimate day of the Ryder Cup is not a victory.
In 1997, the Danish player played his first match at Valderram, where the team captained by Seve Ballesteros scored five points more than the Americans, but in the final match, they were tied with their opponent, winning by a margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2 points.
"We're dominating at Walderram, and you're dominating at Brooklyn, and you're repeating to yourself a few times, but in Brooklyn we lost, and in Walderram we lost, and it was all fair", said Björn, after seeing the game of 2018 that ended 5-3 on Friday and the game at Le Golf National that ended 10-6 on Friday.
So history shows me and the team that this is not the end.
You're leaving tomorrow.
Go and do everything as you are told.
It's not over until the score is shown in the friend.
We have a goal, and that's to win the game, so we have to keep our focus on the game.
I've put all my best effort into the 12 players who played for our side, but we all know who was on the other side -- they were the best players in the world".
"I could never beat myself", said Bjorn, who was impressed with the way his players played on the golf course.
Tomorrow is another day.
And tomorrow's game is all about playing it alone, and that's another thing.
It's good to play around your neck when everything is good, but when you're alone, you're testing yourself as a golfer.
Playing as fully as possible should be the main message that players can send to their brain.
Now you can go out alone, and he must go out alone and do his best".
Unlike Björn, his rival, Jim Furyk, looks for other great players to go out and play alone, and only Jordan Spit, who scored three out of four points, and Justin Thomas, who is not going to be replaced.
Furic himself was a member of both events of the last days: the victorious tribe in Brooklyn before the Europeans were finally defeated in the "Miracle at Medina".
"I remember every word of reproach that was said about him", said Ben Crenshaw, when asked how he gathered his tribe on the last day of his life in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start fast, as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the momentum is one-sided, it puts a lot of emphasis on the matches between them.
We gave the players a sense of inspiration as we prepared our team, as if they were trying to do something magical tomorrow".
Thomas was given the control team and played against Rory McKillra in the main match, and Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, Jan Polter and other European players in the first half.
Bjorn said about selecting individual players, "This is exactly the order I started with this group of players, because this order covers every scary moment in this game".
The new German warship was again delayed
The new frigate of the German Navy was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the outdated fleets of the Cold War, but due to system failures and problems arising from it, it would not be commissioned the following year, local media reported.
According to Die Zeit, which relies on the military official, the commissioning of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate "Rhineland-Pfalz" has been delayed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but the severe consequences of its delivery complicated the fate of the planned project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
They are powerfully locked, and they have a lot of unseen technology, including anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as shorter radiological, infrared, and acoustic signals.
Other important features include a longer service life  new frigates should be able to operate at a distance of up to two years from their own port.
According to Die Zeit, the regular detentions would have made them obsolete by the time modern warships were put into service to help Germany establish its strength abroad.
The F125 was widely reported in the news when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship last year and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet had returned a ship to a company that had built it.
There is not much information about the reasons for the return, but German media have argued that if the ship were used in a war effort, its crucial "programmatic and hardware defects" would render it useless.
The software flaws are particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships have 120 crew members, which is twice the number of crew members on the Bremen-class ships.
In addition, the heavy weight of the ship reduced its productivity and the Navy was unable to make future improvements.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of this class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the equipment that is not working, the overall cost of the project is high, and training the team is another big problem.
The total cost was an astonishing 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), but it was originally estimated to be $2.2 billion.
Recent warnings about the reduction in the power of the German Navy have made the introduction of new frigates more important.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's Defense Committee, admitted that the Navy's "useable ships are in a sharp decline".
The official said that the old ships were decommissioned but not replaced by new ones, so the situation is getting more complicated over time.
It was a sad thing that no other Baden-Württemberg-class ships were left in the fleet.
The National Trust is monitoring the privacy of the publicanats
A new study in Scotland has been conducted to show how the geese use the landscape to search for food.
It is believed that the preparations will help us to study the behavior of unique flying mammals and help us to preserve them in the future.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland examined simple and soprano pipistrels, as well as brown, woolly, and cobalt-like beetles in the Inverververve Gardens of Wester Ross.
Special registers are installed in the main areas around the hotel to monitor the movement of the guests throughout the season.
National Health Service employees and volunteers also use handheld detectors to conduct mobile checks.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will study the frequency of the calls of the phonographs and determine which types of calls.
A map and report of their environment are produced to provide a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dwyer, a conservation advisor at the National Conservation Service, hopes that the results will show which habitat is most important to the herbivores and how each species uses it.
This information helps us to determine the priority of environmental management activities, such as the creation of reefs and how to preserve forest ranges for reptiles and similar species.
In Scotland and Britain, the number of gargantuan beetles has declined over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that threaten their lives and the environment.
Chemical cleaning of paper and building materials, wind turbines, lights, and other domestic animals can pose a threat.
The roots are not basically blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use the technique of the complex echo plane to avoid getting lost or stumbled while flying.
The National Inspection Service, which oversees 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, considers the problem of the logs to be very serious.
Ten trained experts are involved in the field, often conducting surveys and field inspections, and in some cases saving animals.
The organization provided the first and only Scottish reserve for the herds in the Trive Estate of Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten Scottish herds.
Real estate director David Thompson said it was a great place for real estate agents.
"We have a great area for jars in Trieste", he said.
"We have old buildings, old gardens, and a great environment for them to live in.
But much of the information about the herbivores remains unknown, so what we do here and elsewhere helps us to understand what is needed to grow them".
He said that before repair work on the property, it was necessary to check for any germination, because if one maternity home was destroyed, it could lead to the death of about 400 germination workers and younger germination workers, and all the local germination workers could be killed.
It is illegal to kill, maim, disturb, or destroy protected areas.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a member of the Scottish Conservation Trust, called on the community to help.
He said: "We don't know much about our organisms, and we don't know how many species live".
He refused to file a rape complaint because the lawyers were trying to sue him for the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape "proverbial" and said that people were using his name to "make themselves known".
His lawyers have filed a lawsuit against the German news newspaper Der Spiegel, which was charged with corruption.
A Portuguese and Juventus forward was convicted in 2009 of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room.
The Spiegel reported on Saturday that she paid $375,000 to keep her secret.
Hours after the indictment, Cristiano Ronaldo, 33, called the news "fake news" to an audience of 142 million on his Instagram.
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news".
"They will make themselves a mark in my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by my name, but that's part of my job.
I am a happy man, and everything is fine".
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are being sued for allegations that he "has challenged privacy with a soulless message".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the gambler "may be one of the most difficult violations of personal rights in recent years, and that moral damage is compensated in the same way as the difficulty of peace breaches".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronald and Major returned to the player's room and allegedly sexually assaulted the girl there.
The mayor said that Ronald had knelt down after the incident and said that I was "99 percent" "a good kid", but "one percent" had prevailed.
The documents said that he had had had sexual relations with her, but both sides agreed.
The mayor then turned to the police and photographed his wounds, but he later "excepted to take revenge and public humiliation" and agreed to settle out of court.
The 34-year-old said she wanted to repeal the rule because the alleged incident still caused her trauma.
Ronaldo was reportedly raped when he joined Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juventus for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will regret losing its carmakers forever
Business Secretary Greg Clark said that if Britain lost its global leadership in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, it would "regret forever".
Toyota's UK office told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without signing a deal, it will stop production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need this deal", Mr. Clark said.
A Japanese automaker said that if Brexit is not implemented, the border holdings could lead to job closures.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, our factory will stop production", said the director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have expressed concern about how they would sell Honda, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and other products across borders if Britain left the EU without a deal.
For example, a month after leaving the Brexit, BMW announced the closure of its factory in Oxford, Oxford.
If Brexit fails, carmakers are concerned that it will affect their transportation routes.
Toyota's production line is "on time" and vehicles are delivered with parts from both sides of the UB and EU every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, the parts at the border could be held up and have an impact on overall production.
The company says that Toyota's parts in Derbyshire are only for one day, so production will be stopped completely after that.
According to Mr. Clark, Theresa May said that Schaker's future relationship with the EU was "carefully regulated and does not allow for border arrests".
"We need this deal, and we want to have a great deal that not only helps us succeed, but helps us seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only Toyota, but all other manufacturers say we should definitely try to continue the successful product supply chain".
Toyota couldn't say how long production would be delayed, but it said that the long-term increase in prices would reduce the competitive advantage of the plant and lead to fewer jobs.
Peter C. C. Cvallaris, a union organizer who worked at Bernaston for 24 years, said that the number of union members who are being bullied is increasing: "In my experience, these workers never come back once they leave.
A government official said: "We have developed and presented them with a clear and precise plan for the future of our relations with the EU".
The White House says Trump and Rosenstein may be delayed
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed to another week", because Brett Kavanaugh said in a statement to the White House on Sunday that his fight for the Supreme Court was ongoing.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, a special adviser who examines Russian election interference, the relationship between Trump and Russian aides, and the possible obstacles to the president's justice.
The question of whether Trump fired the deputy CEO and threatened the independence of the Mills has been a source of rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times telephoned Rosenstein to Trump and discussed the possibility of removing him from the presidency under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the news.
But despite the reports of her resignation, she went to the White House last week.
Instead, Trump was announced to meet with him this Saturday at the UN in New York.
Trump said he would not fire Rosenstein "rather than", but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee, because both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blassy Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, had given their orders.
On Sunday, Trump ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh, which took even longer for the Senate to vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
He said of the meeting with Rosenstein: "It may be this week, but it may be postponed for a week because of the high court's ongoing case.
But we will see more and keep in touch with the press".
Some reporters have been protesting that Sanders hasn't held a White House briefing since September 10.
The conductor, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not because the reporters disliked the "fake news", but he added: "I can't say they didn't do the "fake news".
And then he proposed to strengthen the direct link between Trump and the press.
"The president is having more Q&A sessions than his colleagues before him", he said, "and we've seen those numbers".
Sanders' briefings are still going on, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been doing this a lot, and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks, and these events are replacing the press briefings that allow us to talk to the president of the United States".
Trump is always answering questions when he leaves the White House, when he goes to public meetings, or when he talks to high-level officials.
One-person press conferences are held only occasionally.
And this week in New York, the president probably showed why he's creating a disliked and surprising image in front of reporters.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to EU workers from the National Health Service in Scotland about the Brexit threat
The Secretary of Health thanked the EU's staff at the National Health Service in Scotland and wrote that the country would remain untouched after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, wrote a letter six months before the EU's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has agreed to pay the costs of transferring public servants to EU citizenship.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the EU and the EU were to continue and lead to a decision that was expected this autumn.
But the UN government is also preparing for a no-deal scenario.
I know that this will be a time of anxiety for all of us.
So I wanted to say once again how much I appreciate the contributions of every worker, regardless of their nationality.
EU and beyond, our partners are strengthening healthcare, providing valuable experience and skills that improve the quality of their work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we would love for you to stay".
Christie Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after suffering a head injury
Michael Organ, Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christie Abercrombie, had an emergency operation after suffering a head injury on Saturday after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennis head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred before it was cured.
"He went out on the side of the road and fell down", said Reed.
The coaches and medical staff put Abercrombie in a lock and then put him on the outside line and gave him oxygen until he was evaluated.
A Tennessee state official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had not had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/level of injury" and that Tennessee is still trying to determine when the injury occurred.
A second-year student in a red jersey, Abercrombie, is playing his first season in Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He scored five points before leaving the game on Saturday, and he scored a total of 18 points during that time.
Foreign buyers are taxed more when they buy real estate from the UK
Under the new Torry plans, when real estate is purchased from the U.B., foreign buyers are charged a stamp payment and the funds are used to help homeless people.
This step will overturn Corbyn 's efforts to attract young voters
Increased stamp payment is charged to non-taxpayers in the U.
The Treasury says the event will raise up to £ 120 million to help homeless people
Foreign buyers are obliged to pay more stamp duty when they buy real estate from the UK, and that extra money is spent on homeless people, Theresa May announced.
This move was seen as an attempt by Jeremy Corbyn to give young voters cheaper housing and then to undermine his success in attracting more people.
The higher stamp payments are from tax-exempt individuals and companies in the U.S., and the extra money will help the government's efforts to help those who sleep at the door.
The current stamp fee will be increased by a total of three percent when you add up the current stamp fee for second and rental properties two years ago.
The Treasury expects revenue to rise by 120 million pounds a year.
And about 13 percent of new homes in London are bought by non-UK citizens, which leads to inflation, which makes it harder for people to buy a home for the first time.
Many parts of the country, especially the capital, have become "beautiful cities", because many foreign buyers live outside the country and come here in large numbers.
The new policy came after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in stamp fees to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of occupying land and not using it, of holding up the number of owners, and he suggested that Mrs. May remove quotas on available housing to stop "housing related shermen" in Britain.
Mr. Korbin announced a series of excellent housing reforms that include the monitoring of rent payments and the prevention of innocent evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said, "I want to dedicate my premiership this year to restoring the British dream of a better life for every generation.
And that means repairing the broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live and work and build their lives here.
But it's not right for people who don't live in the UK and companies to buy houses on the same terms as hardworking British citizens.
Many people have never dreamed of being hospitable, and those who sleep at the door have found it very difficult".
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to rule Scotland".
Sunderland's head Jack Ross said his "highest goal" was to be the manager of Scotland to some extent.
The 42-year-old Scottishman is currently enjoying a rebuilding effort at the northeast club, which is now in third place, three points short of the top division.
He was in charge of the Scottish Premier League last summer, and this summer he was transferred to the Light Stadium.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap and that's it".
"When I was a child, I often traveled from my father and Hamden to Scotland, and I was always attracted to that place.
But I will only have this opportunity if I succeed in running the club".
Before Ross, the rulers of Sunderland were Dick the Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardides, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Allahoun Athletic is happy to run such a big club after such people, because he had previously rejected the offers of Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
"If I can bring this club back to the Premier League, that's a success for me.
If you consider the construction and the potential of this club, it should definitely be in the Premier League".
"It's not easy to get him back in the league, but I can only feel successful if I can bring the club into the league".
Ross has only been in his managerial career for three years, before which he spent 15 months as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and Chervey's coaching staff.
He was then promoted to the third tier when Alloa was sacked, and the following season he won the championship when Saint-Myréndi was sacked.
Ross now feels better than ever in his previous playing career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably the true nine-way collision", he said, "and he remembered that he was responsible for Alloa".
"I was convinced that management was better for me than games.
This sounds surprising, because I was a good gambler, I made good money, and I enjoyed my success.
But it can be difficult to play.
There are many things to do each week.
I still have stress and stress in my job, but I'm in charge.
I have always wanted to rule, and I am doing this now, and I am happy to be in my own skin when I grow up".
You can hear the full interview on Saturday, September 30th on the Scottish radio station Sportsound from 12:00 to 13:00 London time.

The hot summer boosted sales in British pubs, but it was a difficult time for restaurants.
Statistics show that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales, while restaurants saw a 4.8 percent decline.
Peter Martin, a representative of the CGA Business Consulting Company, who compiled the statistics, said: "The good weather and the fact that England played longer than expected in the World Cup in July also showed that pub sales rose 2.8 percent and that restaurants dropped even further.
In June, the number of restaurants fell by 1.8 percent, and in July, it was even worse.
Compared to the numbers in pubs and bars that frequently drink, the number of people who visit pubs is almost higher than the number of customers who are less likely to eat in restaurants.
The number of customers in pubs has also decreased, but not in restaurants.
It seems that people simply wanted a drink.
Pubs and bars increased their sales by 6.6 percent and food by three percent".
Paul Newman, a recreation and hospitality analyst at RSM, said, "These results are continuing the trend that has been going on since late April.
When it comes to marketing in the foreign market, the climate and the main social and sporting events are the main factors.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a 4.8% drop in sales could be a big blow in a year overall due to continued price pressure.
The long summer was a bad time for operators selling hot food, and August was a cooler time, giving many the rest they had been waiting for".
Sales of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened locations, increased 2.7 percent in July, slowing the opening of new locations.
The network sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker is a leading benchmark in the industry, collecting and analyzing the work of 47 working groups with a combined turnover of £9 billion for British pubs, bars and restaurants.
One of the five children has a secret social media account from his parents .
According to a survey, one in five children (some are only 11) have a social media account that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in artificial Instagram pages.
This news threatens to be sexually explicit
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children (including 11-year-olds) has a social media account that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a rapid increase in the number of Instagram photo-sharing accounts.
This news has increased the risk of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students have a "main" account to show their parents, and they also have a personal account.
A mother who had discovered a secret account for her 13-year-old daughter saw a message from a teenager calling her "a rapist".
Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Conference of Directors said that 40 percent of teenagers aged 11 to 18 have a hidden account and their competition has acknowledged it.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is shocking that many teenagers want to create online spaces that their parents and teachers cannot find".
Elide Doyle is the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish athletics board
At the annual general meeting of the governing bodies, Elide Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Doyle, the most proud athlete and chairman of athletics, described the move as a huge international opportunity for sports executives over the past decade.
"Elyde is highly respected in the Scottish, British and global athletics community, and we believe that athletics in Scotland will benefit him a lot", said Beattie.
Doley said, "I try to be an inspiration to athletes and I hope I can contribute to and help guide the sport in Scotland".
The American athlete, who won gold medals in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and four Olympic gold medals overall, and now works as a regular BBC scientist, has been completely unable to walk since he developed ischemia.
He tweeted: "One month ago, on this day, I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors told me that only time would tell if I was well and how much.
It was a very difficult task, but I am completely healed, and I am learning to walk again, and I am doing lightning exercises today!
Thank you for your encouraging comments!"
The online world is divided into two parts about the advertisements for milk suckers that compare mothers to cows .
The advertisement of a dairy breastfeeding company that compared nursing mothers to dairy cows has divided the minds of online consumers.
To mark the launch of the world's first silent breastfeeding vacuum, Elvie, a consumer technology developer, has released a music video to promote the freedom that vacuuming offers to mothers.
Four mothers are dancing in a grassed palace on this track: "Yes, I'm a tailor myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you don't notice that the cow is not a cat, these are my cats".
The choir continues, "Squeeze, sweep, and I'll give the milk to the children, sweep, sweep, sweep, I'm sweating".
Despite this, the company's Facebook page advertisement has sparked controversy online.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times, garnered hundreds of views, received mixed reactions from viewers, and many people have exposed the "threats" of the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use products in advertising.
They have to get pregnant and give birth to milk like we do, but they're going to steal their babies after they've given birth".
Elvie is drowning under her milk coat
Another commented: "It is obviously a trauma for both mother and child.
But why should they be used to promote breastfeeding for women who leave their babies behind?"
Another added: "It was so far from real life".
Others supported the ad, and one woman wrote the song as "laughing".
"I think this is a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
I felt like I was breastfeeding.
The ad is a little crazy, but I bought it on purpose.
This is a brilliant product". Another user wrote.
Another commented, "This is a ridiculous ad for mothers who are working in the bathroom and in the bathroom and feel like they're "good".
This is not a commercial that praises or slanders the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, all the women in the group showed unidentified suction cups, which were covered in underwear.
The campaign's concept is based on the idea that many breastfeeding women feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump is silent, wireless and without pipes, submerged in suction underwear, and invisible, and allows women to move and hold their babies and go out the door during suction.
Anna Balarin, a partner at Mother and a child development specialist at the Early Years, commented: "Elvie Pump  is such an innovative product, it deserves a strong and provocative ad.
In search of similarities between the needs of women and cows, we wanted to show the amazing sense of freedom that breastfeeding and its problems can bring to the public's attention while also providing a vacuum cleaner.
This is not the first time that Elvie has appeared in print ads.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two went to the podium to use the product for a designer named Martha Yakubovskaya.
Hundreds of migrant children were gradually transferred to a camp with border cells in Texas
While the number of border crossings in a month remained the same, the number of migrant children detained increased rapidly, and this was partly due to the harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump administration that made it difficult for people and children to cross the border.
Many of the guarantors were undocumented immigrants who feared losing their opportunity to stay in the country by going ahead and demanding their children.
When the federal government announced in June that future guarantors and other adults in their families would be required to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be submitted to immigration authorities, the risk increased.
Last week, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albens, told Congress that he had arrested dozens of people who had asked for guarantees for unaccompanied children.
70% of those arrested by the agency had never committed a crime before.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are guaranteed or their family members are illegal immigrants in the country, and most of them are criminals.
So we continued to persecute them".
According to the shelter, officials have introduced new rules to keep the children in check, which means that some children are now required to appear in court within a month of their arrest, a period that was previously 60 days.
Most of them don't come in person to defend their situation in immigration court, they do it via videoconference.
Those who are deemed to be ineligible for support are immediately deported.
In recent months, the officials and reports of the refuge have shown that the longer children are held, the more anxiety and depression they experience, leading to violence and escape attempts.
These problems are very common in larger places like Tornillo, because there are so many children that no one is paying attention to their problems.
Moving children to the inner city, without emotional preparation and without the opportunity to say goodbye to their friends, is only making them more traumatic.
Syria has called for the immediate withdrawal of "the forces" of the United States, France and Turkey
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem urged refugees to return to their homes despite eight years of war in the country.
Muallem, the deputy prime minister, also said that foreign forces are fighting against illegal terrorism in Syria and are "really being investigated".
"They must leave immediately and without conditions", he told the crowd.
Muallem testified that the war on terror in Syria, in which more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been displaced since 2011, is "almost over".
He said in Damascus, "This holy war will continue until the Syrian territory is completely cleared". We must clear the region of terrorist groups and "all illegal aliens".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise Kurdish forces against President Bashar Assad and Syrian Arabs.
France has over 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem accused that good conditions were created for the return of refugees, but that "some Western countries" were being motivated by "insensitive fear" of refugees staying abroad.
"We are calling on the international community and international humanitarian organizations to help ensure their return", he said.
"They're politicizing what's going to be a real humanitarian issue".
The United States and the EU have warned that they will not help rebuild Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the buffer zone agreement, the last defense of the Idlib rebels between Russia and Turkey, provided an opportunity for political negotiations to move forward.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped stop the massive Russian-backed Syrian offensive against the region of three million people.
Mu'alem's agreement expressed his belief that the "limited time" and military action against the Nusra field fighters, as well as the jihadists, who are linked to al-Qaeda, would be "deadly destroyed".
UN Special Representative De Mistura hopes to hold the first meeting of a new committee of state and opposition members to develop a post-war constitution and open elections for Syria soon.
Muallem warned that the Syrian government's panel on the terms of participation in the committee was limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and opposed interference.
Why Trump Won a Second Term
And it's logical that Mr. Trump could easily win re-election in 2020 if impeachment and the riot doesn't get him out of office as soon as most liberals would have hoped.
This is bound to be the "most dramatic end of the presidency in history".
The current state of affairs shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, his prime-time government time rating has nearly doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has 1.7 million viewers, up from 2.4 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show" is the top news show on the network, with 3.5 million viewers.
"This is not what we understand, and these people are being set on fire", said Neil Burr, host of ABC's drama show "The Designated Survivor".
Neil Scowell, author of "Just the Funny Parts" and veteran comedy writer, has a theory that goes beyond the surprising details of joining the Hollywood Kids Club.
He recalls that he took a taxi to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver says Trump will vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked why.
"She said, 'Because she makes me laugh,'" said Mrs. Scovell.
The mess has a meaning, too.
And of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story lines from Washington could determine the future of the Roy and Wade conflict, and it would answer questions about whether immigrant families can get together and whether global healthcare reforms are possible.
Removing  is something that is only possible for privileged viewers.
But for six hours, when experts hear Bob Woodward use a "dead fund" for the cover of his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's jacket stitched into the skin of a straw, and $15,000 (a "proudly enlarged dress", according to The Washington Post), and Stormy Daniels' sharp description of Trump's anatomy, every citizen realizes that this is a big deal.
For example, I never saw Super Mario like I did before.
Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, creator of Pawn Stars, said of the dramatic change in cast and the story's changing day (National Football Bowl, Kim Jong-un praise) "You know this show is a reality show, and it's trying to show something different every night".
If you leave an episode, you're left behind.
When I visited Mr. Fless this week, it was a beautiful day outside his home on the north coast of Kauaiig, with a temperature of 80 degrees, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while CNN was recording.
He could not keep himself away from the meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brett Kavanaugh, and the future of the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember that day we were doing crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western culture.'"
"I thought it was a joke, but they were just joking".
Now, Chozic is the author of a memoir, "Driving Behind Hillary", which he wrote for The Times on business, politics and media.
Foreign funds are pouring into the midterm election
It is not surprising that after the Congress redistricting, many resources flooded into Pennsylvania's 17th District, as two strong candidates had to fight for a seat.
This is for the recently re-drawn outdoor regional Democrat in Pittsburgh, Connor Lamb, who won the seat in a special election last summer.
Lamb is another Republican parliamentary candidate who voted against Keith Rothfuss, who is now representing the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, and that district is running the same way as the new 17th District.
The maps were drawn again in January when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old territories had violated the constitution and had been given to the wrong Republican Party.
The race for the new 17th District reduced the funding of the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee and the Republican National Campaign Committee.
Lamb became a household name after winning the popular vote in March in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
This was a Republican seat for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the region by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a little bit of a head start.
The United States has imposed and lifted sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China
Diplomats say the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing, but Washington took action against it.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017, and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization's ruling class.
After "the recent decisions to deny Taiwan recognition", State Department officials decided to recall the heads of American diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, Department press secretary Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only imposed on El Salvador in 2017, which received $140 million in U.S. aid for drug control, development and economic support and other purposes.
The proposed restrictions on financial aid and visa-free travel could have been extremely severe for a Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
During the internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference that emphasized security and economic development, because a similar meeting last year was held as an attempt to stop immigration to America.
But in mid-September, a senior administration official announced that they wanted the conference to be held and would not impose sanctions on El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence will attend a conference in mid-October, which explains the administration's great attention to the conference.
And the American ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic from Washington without any new strong messages or sanctions.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the complexity of the discussions described by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats and agreed to discuss the internal discussions anonymously.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration who spoke anonymously.
The history of the study
The next step could be a special counsel Robert Mueller's statement about Trump's attempts to obstruct justice, which is now publicly available.
According to reports, Müller is also investigating whether Mr. Trump's campaign was engaged by Russia in its attacks on our elections.
If Congress changes its mind, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to the body and he will be held accountable to those who are preparing for reelection and to his colleagues.
There are many "ifs" and I didn't say that Mr. Trump's downfall was inevitable, nor did anyone know the fate of his colleagues in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we are all making decisions that affect how long the battle will last.
If the West resisted Hitler and helped the Czechoslovak army in Munich, German officers would have been ready to launch a coup d'état in 1938.
We could not stop the years of bloodshed that followed.
The direction of history depends on these crucial times, and the progress of democracy will be either faster or slower.
Americans are going through a crucial moment right now.
What if Mr. Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who oversees Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been walking on the fire since he secretly recorded the president's speech last year, arguing that he was unworthy of office.
Mr. Rosenstein said that The Times was inaccurate.
"What if the Federal Bureau of Investigation's investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, and a convicted sex offender is found guilty in the Supreme Court despite reliable testimony and false evidence?
And, besides, are we going to support Mr. Trump in a middle-level vote on the accountability of Congress?
If we pass these tests, democracy will last for a long time.
But from what I learned in Prague, I'm sure we're not going to lose.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, who had occupied my embassy at one time.
She survived, moved to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to that tavern to light a lamp on Saturday.
With my legacy, how can I remain optimistic about our future?

Ranger Graham Dorrance is feeling optimistic ahead of the Rapid Vienna match
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna this Thursday and after a match against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, their victory over the Australians will help the team secure a strong position in the Europa League Group G.
A neck injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from finishing the first leg of his 2-2 away game against Villarreal, but in his game, he believed the Rangers could use that as a springboard to achieve even greater success.
"It was a good game for us, because Villarreal is a great rival", said the 31-year-old.
"When we started the game, we thought we would at least get something, so we came back with a score.
And maybe we could get more points in the end, but overall, we got the same score.
They lost the first half and we won the second half.
Thursday is another important European night.
We might get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did a great job in the last game, and I think when we see the support of our people behind us, we can move forward and do a great job.
It was a very difficult year because I got injured and there were a lot of changes in the club itself, but I'm still very good at this game.
It's a great structure, and the kids are really excited, and the training is going to be really high.
I hope we can move forward and leave a good time behind and make progress".
Women are sleep deprived by their pension plans
Although the respondents knew exactly how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family members about the matter.
In a national survey, about half of the respondents said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent of them talked to their children about it.
"People want their families to give them up, but they don't try to talk about it", said Holly Schneider, president of the National Life Insurance Company.
So here's where you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not discuss your prior wishes, you will not be able to prepare your family to help.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how to get medical care, because this plays a crucial role in determining the cost.
Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
There are three ways to finance long-term care, a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed policy (which helps pay for part of the cost) or self-funding (how long, depending on how long).
Prepare legal documents: First, decide legal issues.
You can provide a letter of trust to the health care provider and your representative will supervise your health care delivery and if you fail to communicate, the professionals will help ensure that your wishes are met.
Consider also the issue of a certificate of service.
If you are unable to do so, you will have to choose a representative to make financial decisions and pay your bills.
Remember the ambiance: Imagine that you are driving an ambulance to your elderly parents to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down the information on paper as if you were ready.
"It's not about money, it's about what doctors are going to do for me", Martin said.
"What medication should I take?
Who provides for the orphan?
Plan those things out".
In the Ilfracombes , a man fired several rounds of pneumatic weapons
One man was walking home at night when a gunman fired several times.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
The shooting, which occurred at 2:30 a.m. local time, was described by officers as a "coco shooting".
The victim did not see the attackers.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
The earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Paluu on Sunday killed more than 384 people and caused an increasing number of deaths.
Rescuers were unable to obtain any information from Donggala, the area north of Palo, nearest to the epicenter of the 7.5-point earthquake.
In the wake of the Palu disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some facts about the island of Palau and Donggala on Sulawesi:
Palú is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and has a total estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency of about 300 kilometers (180 miles) along the northwestern coast of Sulawesi Island.
The province's administrative region, Regency, has a population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of the Central Sulawesi region, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining has also developed in the province, but it is more extensive in Moravia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Natural Disaster Repair Agency, Paul and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami that struck the western part of Donggala in 1996 killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Seismic Risk Zone and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
These are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake in northern Sumatra, off the western coast of Aceh Province, Indonesia, caused a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, most of them from Aceh.
2005: A powerful earthquake struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-point earthquake struck south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, and a tsunami struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-point earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake on the island of Mentawai, Sumatra, caused a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake destroyed the Pidi-Jay Regency in Acheche, and the people were shocked by the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, it was not a tsunami, but the destruction of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: A major earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists unable to return home.
Sarah Palin ' s eldest son is arrested for domestic violence
Trey Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was charged and arrested for assault.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska Police Department, 29-year-old Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, for domestic violence, which prevented his arrest.
According to a police report, a woman's acquaintance seized her phone when she tried to report a suspected crime to the police.
According to a report by KTUU, Paylin Mat-Soo is being held in custody for $500.
When asked if he would confess his sins, according to the news media, he declared himself "unlimitedly innocent".
Payline was charged with three counts of first-degree murder, and he faced up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also convicted of second-degree murder, and he was sentenced to one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This was not the first time that Palin had been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.
His girlfriend said that he had slapped her in the face.
In 2016, veterans criticized Sarah Palin, describing her son's brutal behavior as a traumatic illness after serving in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died in an earthquake in Indonesia
On Sunday, more than 384 people died in an earthquake on Sulawesi Island, Indonesia.
A 7.5-point earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The number of people affected by power outages and power outages is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake struck near Sulawesi, a city northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia.
Social media has been spreading videos of earthquakes.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered on the coast to attend the Sand Festival in the city of Palou.
The federal prosecutor ' s office wants to use the death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking a rare death sentence for federal crimes against Sayfullo Saypov, who is suspected of committing the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people, which has not been used since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov hired a truck, a "depot", and planned an attack on a bicycle road in the West End of Lower Manhattan, where he drowned pedestrians and bicyclists.
According to the Southern District of New York, the prosecutors must prove that Saipa killed eight people "deliberately" and "deliberately" injured them.
The court documents indicate that the death penalty is a rough one.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal court ruled that Saipov was guilty of 22 counts, including one count of terrorism-related murder of eight people, which was primarily used by federal prosecutors for organized crime, assault and vehicular destruction.
The prosecutor said the attack required "deep planning and preparation", describing Saypov's actions as "abhorrent, cruel and abusive".
"Saipov's intentions were to cause trauma and serious injury to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cléves, Anne-Lora Decadette, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoz and Alejandro Damián Pagnucco", the statement said.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last execution in the Southern District of New York.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was sentenced to life in prison.
The death penalty in a federal case in New York was imposed on the family of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953, two years earlier, during the Cold War with the Soviet Union, for making a promise of espionage.
Both Rosenberg were executed on June 19, 1953, in the electric chair.
According to court documents, the Uzbek citizen Saypov did not regret his actions, even days and months after the attack.
The police said that he did not regret his actions.
According to the indictment, the video of ISIS on Saypov's phone inspired the attack.
The police also said that he had asked the hospital to hang the ISIS flag.
He pleaded not guilty to the charges under Article 22.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal social advocates, said they were "very disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
Patton said, "The use of the death penalty, not the life sentence that cannot be released, will only increase the trauma of the victims".
The lawyers who supported Saipov had previously asked the prosecutor's office not to impose the death penalty.
MP for Tory, Naijel Faraj, said he should be responsible for the Brexit deal
During a protest today at the conference in Tori, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army".
The former leader of the Ukip said politicians should "feel warm" to the Eurosceptics, because Theresa May, the Member of Parliament, suggested that she should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
At a march in Birmingham, the conservative agent Peter Bon said that if Farage were the Secretary of the Brexit Act, Britain would have "gone out" by now.
When Mrs. May tried to reconcile her deeply divided tribe, the problem was that Torini's supporters had joined a separate protest group against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is doing everything in his power to maintain his chess-like plan in the attacks of Brexit, the rest of the EU and the rest of the world.
Despite this negative reaction, the Allies continued to negotiate with Brussels, forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their plan and the "boss".
Mr. Bon said at a rally in Sollihalle that "Going means leaving" that he had "a chessboard".
He suggested that Mr. Faraj be made equal and respond to the agreements with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for this, we would leave now", he said.
A deputy from Wellingboro said, "I'll stand for Brexit, but we have to lose in chess".
In his speech against the EU, he said: "We did not fight for independence in world wars.
We want to write our own laws in our own country".
Mr. Bon Jovi rejected the idea that the public has changed since the 2016 vote: "It's a complete lie that the British want to change their minds and now they want to stay".
And the Brexit leader from Tory, Andrea Jenkins, was on the march again, and she told the reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Shakhat is not popular among the people, the opposition does not vote for it, it is not popular among our party and activists who will elect us first.
Stop playing chess and start listening".
In a statement to Mrs. May, he said, "If the prime ministers keep their promises, they will keep their jobs".
Mr. Faraj said that if politicians were to buy the 2016 referendum, they should "do as they pleased".
"It's a matter of trust between the people and the political class", he said.
"They're trying to sell Brexit, and we're here today to tell you, 'We're not going to let you do that.'"
In a public statement, he added: "I do not want our political class to be left out of the Brexit betrayal".
"We will mobilize the people's army of this country, which has brought us victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we have an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom".
At the same time, before a two-hour rally in the city centre, the Remaining People marched through Birmingham.
After the group was disbanded this week, several activists were standing up with a Tory anti-Brexit poster.
When the conference began, Labour leader Lord Adonis mocked the security-related conservatives when he met them through an app to party with them.
"These people say we can get all the IT systems and all the technology in Canada+, the borderless border, the free trade lands in Ireland", he said.
"It's a complete joke.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit".
Warren plans to "go to a tough preparation" for the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "prepare herself for the presidential election" after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future in a rural town in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November 2016 against Republican Jeff Dill, who was a former chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He was in the midst of predicting he could beat Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, in Holyoke, Trump held his 36th meeting with other voters in the Russian format since taking office.
The participants asked the president if he planned to run for president.
Warren said, "It's time for women, including the woman above, to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government".
A Louisiana State University student named Sims is arrested for shooting
According to a statement released Saturday by Baton Rouge Police in Louisiana, the defendant was arrested after the performance of LMU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported on the outside news channel that at 11:00 a.m., 20-year-old DiThon Simpson was arrested.
On Sunday, they posted a video of the shooting and asked for help identifying the person.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed Friday morning outside the South Campus.
According to 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press Saturday that "Wade Sims was shot in the head and died".
Wade tried to be his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being there, to using a weapon, and to shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and arrested at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, at 6.6 feet (2 meters) tall, played in 32 games last season with 10 starts, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after defeating Sebastian Fettell after a team order
When Valtery Bottas qualified first from Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became known that Mercedes was playing a big game.
In the game, Bottas was off to a good start, beating Hamilton, because in the first two turns he defended his position, and then called Fettell to attack his partner.
Fettle was going to be the first to get into the hole and put Hamilton on the ball's tail on the road, and that would be a defining moment.
The Mercedes went through the lap and was out of the way, but Hamilton hit the wheel and took the lead, and in the third turn, he saw that Ferrari was too hard to defend and he didn't want to let go.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He finished faster and was ahead of the rest of the race, trying to outdo Kimi Raikkonen, who finished fourth.
After the 44th lap, he finally fell into the abyss and was unable to improve his speed in the remaining eight laps, as he finished fourth to Rykkon.
Walttery did a great job all weekend, so today is a tough day for him, and I knew he was a real gentleman because he gave me the opportunity to be with him.
The team played their best to get first and second place".
Using a sign language to express bad things
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday, who said he never told anyone about the letter of Supreme Court candidate Christina Blaisey Ford about sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting with West Virginia, the president did not directly respond to Ford's instructions to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that people in the Senate were "mischievous, fraudulent and deceitful" about what was happening.
"You've seen what's been happening in the Senate in the last few days, you've seen people who are deceitful, deceitful and deceitful, angry and mean, and this amazing thing is going on", he said.
"Even if you see the evidence and they're spreading it, they're like, 'Oh, it's not me.
I did not do it".
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, are you late?
Remember the answer... you were late?
Oh, no, not at all.
I did not lie down.
He waited.
We were slow... No, we weren't".
A statement was sent to Feinstein about the allegations, written by Ford Cavano, which was made public in July and went public in September, but Feinstein did not admit to the leak from his office.
"I didn't hide, I didn't give away Ford's instructions or his story", he told the committee.
"He told me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret just as he told me".
But the president seemed to be displeased with his lack of acknowledgment, and he said at a rally on Saturday: "His sign language speaks the truth.
Perhaps not, but his behavior and his sign language indicate something else".
While he supported his candidacy in the Supreme Court and accused him of being raped by three women, the president accused the Democrats of using the accusation for their own benefit.
"They are ready to return to power by any means necessary.
You see something really, really disgusting, no matter who they offend or who they run into, they want to control and take power", Mediaite reported in a presidential speech.
Elite League: The Danish Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a game against Dundee
The Dundee Stars played the Elite League on Friday and won again against the Belfast Giants, who finished 5-3 on Saturday at Dundee.
The Giants took the lead with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowie's goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney rose through the ranks, until Dwyer regained the leadership of the Giants.
Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals tied the score with Francois Boucher Dundee before they won.
This was Adam Keef's third defeat of the season in the elite league, coming on as they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season, where the Giants had won three previous games.
Dwyer's anger came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFall's assistant, and David Rutherford came to the rescue, because Bowie doubled his lead after the fourth minute.
Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 13:10 in the first period, and Matt Markward tied the score with Corny at 15:16.
Dwyer revealed that the Giants had taken the lead in the first innings, and he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The owners were back together, and Buster tied them again in his own attempt at 27:37.
Conaway and Charles Corcoran joined forces, and they gave Nielsen the lead for the first time, and Dundee led the lead at the end of the second term, and he led his team to victory in the final term.

An air traffic controller died to save hundreds of people on board the plane from an earthquake
An Indonesian flight attendant died, earning the title of hero, after having helped hundreds of people to fly from the ground.
The earthquake and tsunami that struck Sulawesi on Friday killed more than 800 people, many of whom went missing.
There were still severe earthquakes in that region, and many people were left in ruins at Palos.
Despite the fact that his colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antoine Guanavan refused to leave the trembling dispatcher's seat at the Mutiara Sisi Al-Jufri airport in Agung-Palu.
He was on the runway to ensure the safe departure of Batik Air Flight 6321.
Then he jumped out of the sky, thinking that he was falling apart.
He later died in hospital.
Johannes Syrait, a spokesman for the Indonesian airline, said the decision saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We prepared a plane from Balippana to Kalimantan to take him to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it before the plane arrived in Palo this morning.
"We were very saddened", he said.
At the same time, government officials fear that the death toll could exceed 1,000, as the disaster relief agency said that road closures were in place in Donggala, Sigi, and Butong.
"The death toll is rising because many are still under the ruins and many have not been able to get out", reports agency spokesman Sotopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters have devastated the city, and on Sunday, the bodies will be buried in a mass grave.
Military and commercial aircraft were bringing help.
"Every minute, emergency services were bringing bodies", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother to Sky News.
There is little clean water.
They robbed all the shops".
Jan Gelfand, International Red Cross of Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross has been quick to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find there.
It is a tragedy, but it can be even more difficult".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited Palo and told the country's armed forces: "I ask you to work day and night to implement the evacuation plan.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia, devastated the city, killing 550 people.
Air Niugini says one person has gone missing after a plane crash in the region
The airline said that the plane had been crashed in the Pacific region of Micronesia, that all 47 people on board had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane, and that one person was missing.
According to Air Niugini, on Saturday, they found a male passenger counting and could not find him.
The airline said that it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for detailed information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane sank while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Sunday, officials said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact circumstances of the accident remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane was on the runway in the area.
Some witnesses thought the plane had lost its way.
American passenger Bill Jens said the plane was too low.
"It's a very good thing", said Jens.
He said that he and others were able to get out of the emergency door by drowning in a plane that had been flooded to the waist.
The flight attendants reported that they were panicked and shouted, and they suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that the seamen who worked on the coast improvement also helped rescue and used the home ship to help bring people to shore until the plane sank 30 feet.
The flight safety commissioner said 111 people died in the last two decades of flight operations reported by PNG airlines, none of them related to Air Niugini.
Analyst publishes the night schedule of the woman who was burned alive
On Saturday, a prosecutor in Mississippi charged a man with setting fire to a woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst for the U.S. Department of Justice, has spent several hours testifying as an expert in the analysis of the investigation assignments.
The jury used cell phone recordings to try to determine the activities of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the victim, the night of her death.
According to Roulette, he obtained the location data of several phones, which showed that Tellis and Chambers were strangers that night (he had previously given different instructions) and reported to The Clarion Ledger.
When the police revealed that Chambers had his cell phone, and that he had been with Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Stanford admitted that he was out of town that Saturday night.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth about being in a truck with Sanford that night, Sanford said, "He's faking it because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is that Tells told Chambers that he only knew Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone recordings showed that they only knew each other for a week.
And she said that after Chambers' death, Tellys deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information.
"He took her out of his life", said Hale.
The defense must present its final arguments on Sunday.
The court ordered that the case be referred to the mediators that evening.
High-end: What is reasonable hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio has been trying to challenge the negative attitude towards the genre by filling the music with a positive message.
He said that the High Breed hip-hop in Bristol was far from its original purpose, which was to be political and social.
They want to go back to their roots and re-introduce sound hip-hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have witnessed a revival in Britain thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
A New York nanny sued a couple for being racist
A New York nanny sued the couple for discrimination and firing because her employer called her "the black man in the room".
The couple refused to admit that they were racist and viewed the accusation as an "incident to make money".
When the new worker, Giselle Morris, the mother of two, Lynsey Placebo-Flaxman, got to work on her first day in 2016, she was shocked to see that she was black.
"I am the only person who has ever lived", wrote Lindsay Placebo-Flaxman to her husband.
But she sent the message to Mrs. Morris twice, not to her husband.
Knowing that he had made a mistake, Plexson-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and said that the now-departing nanny was being rude to the African American and her job, so she was now expecting a Filipino worker.
Morris was paid for her day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now Morris is demanding compensation for the couple's dismissal and a $350 per day contract for six months, but he was hired without signing a contract.
"I want to show them that they shouldn't do that", he told the Post on Friday, and then added, "I know it's discrimination".
Instead of insulting him as a racist, the couple felt distrust and fear, so he said that it was reasonable to stop.
"My wife sent him a message that she would not tell him.
He is not a racist.
We are not a racist people", her husband, Joel Plasto, told the Post.
"But if he were wrong, would you give your children to someone you have treated badly?
A newborn child?
Let me see".
He compared the prayer to a "production effort", and Placebo said that his wife was two months pregnant and that she was "in a very bad condition".
"Would you follow someone like this?
This is not a good thing".
The case is still ongoing, and the public court has criticized the couple's behavior and logic, and the information has quickly spread on social media.
A new letter from Paddington publishers says they feared that students would not accept the talking bear
Bob's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was accepted, said in the letter: "It's hard to be in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time before it's published.
We were very happy to hear about Paddington's great successes".
Until he wrote a children's book about a little toy bear, his father was a BBC operator, and sadly passed away last year on the 60th anniversary of the publication of that book.
Describing Paddington as "a very important member of our family", he added that his father was deeply proud of his success.
"He was a very humble man, " he said, "and he was not a man of pride".
"But Paddington was so real to him that he was almost like a child who had achieved something, and you're proud of his success even if he didn't succeed.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Even though it was his design and his imagination, he always praised Paddington for his successes".
My daughter was dying and I had to make a phone call to her.
After her daughter was convalesced, doctors rushed her to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice to save her life.
"The noise was unexpected, it was really bad", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then the next two minutes, Nad, who was dying, called to say goodbye, and I had no choice but to say goodbye.
I said goodbye.
I said, 'Stone, I love you so much, my lamp.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.'"
His heart was completely depleted of the medicines he was given, and his body was dying.
He died before it was over.
I knew it was over, but I was sitting there waiting for something.
I could not cry or scream or cry because I was surrounded by my family and others.
I had to concentrate".
Eventually, Ednan-Laperous, mourning the loss of his daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, despite the ordeal.
"No one knows", he said.
"I kept my head down and my tears were flowing.
It's hard to explain, but just during the flight, my compassion for Nad was so great.
I needed to be loving and understanding.
I knew how much she loved him".
Women mourning a message that prevents a grieving woman from committing suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to distraction from suicide are working.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Douglas were leaving a ventilator and phone numbers and cards on the Welsh Bridge to support people.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to experience the feelings I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Leeds, said that her son was a brilliant cook.
"Everyone knew her smile.
She smiled and told me that she was the lighting of a room".
However, he left his job before he died, because he felt "like a man in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler, an 11-year-old boy, was found dead after committing suicide.
And Mrs. Davis said, "I'm always waiting for someone to knock on the door".
Davis began making cards so that people would know that they had "people to go out and talk to and make friends".
You must keep quiet and talk "
Mrs. Davis was a close friend of Mrs. Davis, whose husband of 15 years committed suicide after losing his mother.
"She didn't say she was depressed or anything", he said.
"The night before Christmas, he noticed that his wife's attitude had changed.
It was a different Christmas day, and the children were staring at the presents when they opened them".
His death was a great loss for them, but they had to live with it.
We are in deep sorrow.
But we have to endure it all and fight it".

The future of Brett Kavanaugh has been unknown since the Federal Bureau of Investigation began investigating him .
"If we conduct a limited investigation in time and scale as he asks, we may be able to get a little more united", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, "the committee is feeling a lot of guerrilla sentiment".
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation instead?
Their refusal was conditioned by a period of time.
The midterm election is just five weeks from November 6th. If, as expected, the Republicans lose, they may not be able to elect any person to the Supreme Court.
George Bush called the Senators and urged them to vote for Mr. Kavanaugh, who had previously worked for Bush in the White House and married Ashley, Bush's private secretary.
What happens when the FTB creates its own pathway?
51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are up for election in the current Senate.
Mr. Kavanaugh gets at least 50 votes in the Senate, and Vice President Mike Pence gets his vote and his candidacy for the Supreme Court, but whether he gets that many votes is the big question.
The number of North Korean deserters is "dead" under Kim
A South Korean deputy said the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Beon Seog, based on the data from the Ministry of the South, said that there were 1127 refugees last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the increased border controls with North Korea and China and the increased wager demands of the militants were the main reasons.
North Korea has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are gradually offered South Korean citizenship.
After the Seoul War, 30,000 North Koreans said they had been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
North Korea has a long border with North Korea and is mostly run through China, which is easier to cross than the heavily defended areas between the two Koreas.
China sees them as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forces them back home.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still in a technical war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in North Korea to discuss disarmament.
This was after a historic meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, who agreed to operate on the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yen-woo accused the United States of not taking any action against the sanctions.
"Without any trust in the United States, we will lose confidence in our national security under conditions like this, where we never give up our unilateral weapons first", said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "a starving man" and considered him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, "disappointed", saying he was unfit for the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman had done this, I think they would have called her 'natural,'" Pelosi said, speaking about Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusations that Dr. Christine Blassey Ford had raped her when she was a teenager.
Kavanaugh was shouting loudly during the report, and he was breathless and emotional as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also accused the committee's Democrats of "unreasonable deliberate murder" against him, organized by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
When asked about Kavanaugh, Pelosi said he was a Democrat, and that he proved that he could not be a Supreme Court justice.
"I think that's a self-disqualification for his statement and for his opposition to Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was intrigued by the question of whether he could hold Kavanaugh accountable if he could be proven guilty and the Democrats in the House of Representatives could win a majority.
"If he has not told the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not worthy to serve not only in the Supreme Court but also in the current court", Pellosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Columbia.
I'm shocked by Pelosi Kavanaugh's decision on the availability of medical care or the Raw Wade case, because he said the court was conservative.
During his hearings, Kavanagh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn the decisions of the famous Supreme Court.
"It's a very hysterical time to go to court and not say 'how wonderful'", said Pelosi.
Women must be skilled in this.
It's a sincere diatribe, it's been going crazy for months and years, and a woman can't get it out without crying.
"If we are angry, we cry", said Mrs. Stynem to me 45 years later.
"I think this is not uncommon, do you?"
He added, "I was helped by a woman who was a performer, and when she got angry and started crying, she developed a technique that would tell the man, and he would say, 'You might think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I am angry with you".
He then continued.
I thought that was a good idea".
The Bible says that "weeping is a deep-rooted, deep-seated, and deep-seated thing".
I was crying and crying one day when I was working in a man's workplace, and an older colleague, who I was always afraid of, came up behind me and grabbed me and took me out into the hallway.
He said, "They should never see you cry".
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you are upset and are happy to have you there".
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman for the Democratic Party in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he ran for president.
In 1987, when Mrs. Hart was arrested with someone other than her wife on a boat called Monkey Business, Mrs. Schröder was so upset that she thought she should run for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he said with a laugh after 30 years.
"There were seven other candidates in the race who did not want to be joined by another.
Some called them "Belovet and the Seven Gnomes".
He eventually joined the vote, and he began to raise funds late and vowed not to run unless he raised $2 million.
It was a race to be won.
He found that those who gave $1,000 to other candidates gave only $250 to the female candidate.
"Do they think they can make a discount for me?"
When she announced the official campaign's failure, she spoke so emotionally that she was grateful for the people who supported her, and she was angry at the system that made it so difficult to raise money, and she was angry at sexism.
"You thought I was so nervous", said Schröder, recalling the press reaction that day.
"You might think Kleenex is my sponsor.
I wondered what they would write on my grave.
Did he say, "She cried?"
How the US-China trade war benefits Beijing
Trade between the US and China is a war wagon, but experts say the long-term benefits of the conflict between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing.
Donald Trump, the first U.S. president to warn, earlier this year imposed taxes on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
There was a significant increase this week: $200 billion worth of goods were subject to new tariffs, and half of all Chinese goods imported into the United States were taxed.
Beijing responds every time, with the last line raising tariffs on US goods of $60 million from 5 percent to 10 percent.
China said it would now respond to every move by the US and that the world's second largest economy would not die.
Chinese President Xi Jinping understood that Washington had to surrender to these requirements to take a step back, but he was too embarrassed to bow down to the US publicly.
However, experts say that if Beijing's maps are played correctly, the long-term impact of the US trade war on China could be positive if the two economies are reduced to a level of dependence.
"If Washington or Beijing makes a quick political decision, it could have far more serious consequences for both countries than experts have predicted", said Abigail Grace, an Asia expert at the New American Security Center.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs said, "We are ready for the return of Syrian refugees".
Syria is willing to return the refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by the seven-year war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Iranian Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'alim said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the local situation has become stable and safe after the counter-terrorism campaign", he said.
The government is continuing its efforts to restore normal areas destroyed by terrorists.
All forces are now conducting unilateral economic measures to help refugees who have been forced to flee by terrorism return to their country voluntarily, to improve their daily lives and living conditions.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mutafa said the Syrian regime would be grateful for any help in rebuilding the deserted country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept aid from the countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe reinforces its victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European tribe won the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris against the US team with a final score of 16.510.5.
The United States has lost six straight European Championships and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
When the Danish captain Thomas Björn scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States, Europe regained its crown.
Most of the tournament's star, Phil Mickelson, scored three pairs in the 16th hole, and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian athlete Molinari was a star in all competitions, and he is one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit defeated the most underrated player in Europe, the Danish Turbjørn Olesen, 5-4 to win the tournament.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, defeated England's Ian Pauler 2-1 and he could have played in the final.
Sergio Garcia, an eight-time Ryder Cup veteran from Spain, is the best 25.5 points scorer in European history.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stop today.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful that Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I am so happy to have won the trophy back, and I feel so happy.
The team will decide everything, and I'm happy to be able to help".
He gave the torch to his fellow American golfer John Ram, who won the game 2-1 on Sunday over Tiger Woods.
"I'm so happy to beat Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him play", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup career.
Jack Nicklaus, who won 14 titles, was the greatest player of all time.
The U.S. team played very little in the tournament, only Patrick Kamish, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau played at the highest level of the entire tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing game, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
One morning we were beating Europe.
We were destroyed.
We obey Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 players played well.
We're going to build the team up again, and we're going to work with the PGA of America and our own Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to be their captain.
You should take off your clothes in front of them.
We played too much".
Red light updates: decreased concentrations of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a decline in the red tide in the Tampa Bay area.
The commission said that the conditions for overgrowth were set for Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier.
The red water has been extended from the northern Pinellas to the southern Lié regions for about 130 miles (209.21 km).
And you can see these sites 10 miles from Hillsborough, but they're much smaller than last week.
The red cloud was also seen in the Pasco region.
There were reports of moderate concentrations in and around Pinellas last week, and low to high concentrations in the Hillsborough area, high concentrations in Manatee, high concentrations in Sarasota or nearby coastlines, moderate concentrations in Charlotte, high concentrations in Lee and nearby coastlines, and low concentrations in Collier.
In Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier, there is still a respiratory allergy.
Last week, there were no respiratory allergies in Northwest Florida.
