According to a report published by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran has begun to use advanced separators to accelerate its production and further violate the 2015 nuclear agreement with the world.
According to the IAEA report, the advanced separator of the Iranian Natanz Nuclear Facility is “accumulating or ready to accumulate accumulated iron.”
Since U.S. President Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal in May last year and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran has gradually violated the limitations of the 2015 nuclear deal with the Great Powers.
The agreement stipulates that Iran will only use the first-generation IR-1 discharge machine.
Other signatories of the agreement, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to save the agreement, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of doing not enough.

Women are hoping to defend World Cup in advance!
On 27th, in the match against the Netherlands women's ranks, the Chinese team in the case of winning the two matches was kicked back to a city by the opponent, in the end with 3:1 Rick Holland, receiving nine wins.
The course of the World Cup is close to the end, although the defence is waiting, but facing the Serbian team, the Chinese women's ranks are still unable to fall away.
With the first two matches of the Netherlands, the Chinese women's ranks performed strong as usual, with 25:19, 25:16 ahead of the two cities, up to the third, the team met disappointment.
The Dutch female ranks strengthened the aggressivity of playing the ball in the circumstances behind, the Chinese team was shocked, plus the girls attacked, the mistakes began to increase, and finally with 21:25 the opponent was kicked back to a city.
In an interview, Xi Jinping also said: “Third stage, because of a mistake we gave about eight points.”
Of course, the Dutch women's ranks were not allowed to be small, the Chinese women's ranks were also prepared hard before, although losing one ranks, but everything is still in the hands of Rongping, "and the strong team to play the game losing is normal, playing the five ranks is also normal, so we told the team members to focus," Rongping said.
In the fourth round, the team members actively adjusted the state, Zhang Chening opened the fire at the end of the attack, the single round got 8 points, and the team won a big job.
The match until now, the 11 rounds of confrontation are only two rounds left, Chinese women's ranks although one hand has already touched the championship cup, but in the match against the Netherlands the Chinese women's ranks are actually alarmed: the more critical the moment, the more to do the best.
In another match on 27th, Russia and the U.S. female ranks filled 5 points, the U.S. team failed to get all three points from their opponents, so that the Chinese female ranks only get all three points in the match against Serbia, can make a round of defense in advance.
Every situation develops towards a favorable situation for Chinese women.
However, while the Serbian team has a lack of numbers, this does not mean that they will easily give three points to the Chinese team.
From the form of the current ranking, the Serbian team is already basically without a medal, which means that they can "leak up" in the match against the Chinese women's row, put down the burden to strike the opponent, while the Chinese team is under pressure to win the crown, and the situation may instead occur.
Furthermore, the replaced Serbian team is also not the "man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man-man.
Before the third stage of the match began, Rongping also said that both teams are not good to face: “Osaka’s match will be very difficult, we still have to be as usual, seriously prepared.”
Now the corner of the corner has swallowed, and the game has actually entered the “white heating phase”.
As for the power theory, the Chinese women's ranks are above the opponents, only the last important end, it also depends on whether the women's ranks girls can play the normal level, free themselves at the field.

The Republic is going to celebrate its seventh anniversary, the lighting of all the street media is bright, so that many of us often don’t remember the images, the flashes are bright—they are, for our bright days, the shrimp brings heat energy, brings light source...
However, if the hero goes along, it also looks normal like you like me.
Yuan Loongping, the research of rice, cultivated good species throughout the earth, so that a hundred billion nationals are no longer hungry risk, work is great, this ounce is usually like a old farmer who loves in the field ground heads; Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan Loong, Yuan
They, asking for righteousness, live purely, simple and consistently, as long as they are immersed in the strangers who do not understand and they do not know themselves in the business, they will easily be happy to live up, and they don’t care about the name of Toliso, rich and glorious.
As in the Qur’an, as in the Qur’an, as in the Qur’an, as in the Qur’an, as in the Qur’an, as in the Qur’an, as in the Qur’an, as in the Qur’an, as in the Qur’an, as in the Qur’an, as in the Qur’an.
Every “Shaun Monk”, every piece of the baby’s heart, behind it is a part of whom the family is responsible for me.
The country is responsible, not only on the shoulders of the hero, but also on the hands of millions.
Once, a high school girl said, “When the hero passes, there is always someone sitting on the street to praise ... I don’t want to be a hero, I want to be a man sitting on the street to praise.”
In fact, when the hero and praise to the hero are not contradictory.
Those who praise on the road, also transmit heat and light, and themselves also light.
Ordinary like you like me, there are always some mechanisms in life, there are some moments, there is a kind of sunshine, and it also shapes the appearance of a hero.
Shanghai Excellent Judge Zhou Bewar, who is responsible for the reform of justice, but in the annual meeting gave the communication room teacher Fou to the office to tell his story, a year sent countless newspapers letters, from no mistake, “to do the simple things, it’s not simple”, Zhou Bewar led the judges will give praise to this “Shaun Monk” style old receipt.
This is a struggle between the heroes, a hero is praising another hero.
Shandong monastery has a small-lined temple covered by the cabin, Yuan Lun Ping has a wide rice experimental field, South Yuan Dong has a "heaven eye", Qin Yuan has a stage, Zhu Yuan Chang has a forum ... can he be a hero, not alone to rely on his own efforts, more to have a good environment and a positive motivation mechanism.
For example, “China Sky Eye”, now appears to be a myth.
In the 1990s, the Chinese technology and technology community was still hard to climb, and the novelist Liu Xiao Hyun has not yet started writing The Three Body.
At that time, the “eye” was the one-sided radial telescope in the U.S. Puerto Rico Valley — Aresibo, with a diameter of 350 meters, considered the world’s most “untouchable”.
At that time, the Chinese radio telescopes had a diameter less than one tenth of the population.
And in Japan, Nanjing Dong, who enjoys world-class research conditions and wages, continues to return to the country, bringing back a almost crazy idea: China builds a new generation of radiation telescope, receiving more messages from the outer space!
China is looking forward to investing big money to play the stars.
Motherland trusts South Rin-tung, the “Heaven Eye” project is opened.
The election took 12 years and the position to be completed was 9 years.
The 500-metre diameter of the “Heaven’s Eye” opened, China made a “unprecedented great scientific project in the world”.
So, “the sky eye” is great, the Southern Rhinestones are great, there is a great, standing high-looking republic is great.
With the confidence of the country, the good will of the people, the Southern Guinness side has the opportunity to become the heart of the soul of the people of the country.
There are young genius, white-haired heroes who have gone through, there are people on the road gently praising, such a country, very beautiful and harmonious.
Waste Classification Education First In Guilin Kindergarten Environmental Concept Starts From Puppies
On the 27th of July, a kindergarten in the province of Jilin, in the province of Jilin, conducted a waste classification education course, teaching young children to distinguish recyclable waste and other categories of waste.
This is the first time that the waste classification enters the local child education classroom.
Earlier, nine departments of the province of Gilin jointly issued the “Gilin province to promote urban life waste classification treatment work program”.
On the basis of the 2019 pilot for the obligatory classification of living waste in Long Spring City, the province decided to carry out the work of the classification of living waste in urban areas.
The city of Gilin is one of them.
Through this activity, we want to the influence of family driving with young children, children's gardens driving society, and to defend the concept of environmental protection.
The event was organized by Hi Fanel International Kindergarten Executive Park Director Liu Liqiang said.
On that day, the garden manager read the environmental protection initiative, hoping that the waste classification begins with the children.
After the children performed the low-carbon baby dance, the group started a small game of waste classification.
The guide teachers also issued the “recyclable” “Other Waste” label, suggesting children to stick the label to the wastes after they’re home and record a small video.
Liu Liu introduced that the kindergarten has always advocated the low-carbon, green environmental concept, and regularly opens a environmental conference hall.
The waste deposits in the garden are also set to categorize the waste bars, which are marked above the deposits category.
Teachers teach children what is recyclable.
According to preliminary statistics, the production of urban life waste in the province of Guilin in 2018 amounted to approximately 546.52 million tons, all of which entered the living waste processing facility for processing.
Of these, sanitary filling 329.29 million tons, burning 209.23 million tons, taking a comprehensive use process process of 8.01 million tons.
After many years of efforts, the province’s municipalities have the ability to treat life waste harmlessly.
In the “Gilin Province to promote urban life waste classification treatment work program” which has been published, it clearly requires deepening the activities of waste classification to campus, teaching materials, classrooms, and other activities, by creating waste classification songs, songs, comics, micro-video and other works, to strengthen the interaction between students and parents, to the effect of “educating a child, influencing a family, driving a community, educating a generation of new people”.

Japan's domestic sales decreased by 6%, and the demand for final buses before the increase in consumer tax in October was limited.
In August, Mazda sold 17,729 units in China.
In August 2018 it also dropped by 13% compared to the previous year, with sales continuing to decline.
China’s specialized main-power SUV “CX-4” sales decreased by 14%.
The “CX-4” was released in 2016 for a long time, and the new car’s performance decreased.
Reduction of prices due to a strategic standing in a long-term perspective to increase the brand value, it is also known to have a significant impact on sales.
The sales of Mazda in the U.S. have increased by 7% and reached 27482 units, increasing over 14 months.

Hirak died and political heritage survived.
Former President of France, Hillary Clinton, died on Monday at the age of 86.
During the century of unprecedented change in the world, the many political heritage that this French politician left during his time of rule is still worth praising.
He has been president of France for 12 years in a very personal way.
He both inherited the diplomatic spirit of the independent De Gaulle, and strongly supported European integration, and was a representative of the pursuit of the "European Dream".
At the same time, he also strongly defends world polarisation and multilateralism, and is a politician with a strategic perspective.
That’s why the French media ranked him as a “excellent representative of France on the world stage”.
One of the political decisions of Hirak is against the U.S. dominated Iraq war.
Under his leadership, France, together with Germany, overtakes the U.S. pressure and goes on the front of the anti-war.
A year after the war began, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an exacerbation of terrorism and make the world more dangerous.
The latter facts show that Hirak’s warning was very correct.
In the moment of Europe’s integration falling into a row and American unilateralism becoming increasingly highlighted, Hillary has no doubt a strong revelation of the strategic thinking and choice of international politics and global affairs.
He was also a French politician who made the Chinese feel familiar and kind.
He is one of the advocates and creators of the "Golden Decade" of China-Foreign Relations, and after being first elected President of France in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of China-Foreign Relations with the strategic perspective of politicians.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and China and France entered a new phase of bilateral relations.
During Shirak's rule, the bilateral trade volume between China and France grew rapidly, and the cooperation between the two countries in many areas of aviation, nuclear energy, rail transport and other areas has achieved prominent progress.
The Chinese-French Cultural Year initiated by Shirak, created a new model of cultural exchange in the history of China-French.
Hirak's love for Chinese culture has been impressive throughout his life.
According to his Chinese diplomat’s introduction, Hirak can back some poems of Li White and Duff, and can even judge accurately the history of the Chinese bronze machine.
“I don’t see the pyramid really arrived in Egypt, I don’t see Qing Chen really arrived in China,” — this gold phrase came from Hirak.
He said in an interview with the news agency: “The West is concerned about China’s political and social development, the ecological issues arising from China’s economic growth and China’s political position internationally.
I have full confidence in China.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization and its experience is sufficient to help it build the concepts and values of harmonious development and take on its long-term responsibility on the world stage.”
I also believe that China’s resurrection will bring new creativity to the world culture and enrich the world culture.
The people have gone, but the political heritage and revelation of Hirak left to the world will survive with the world.

The statement stated that the action of the Foreign Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States to adopt the relevant bill was not necessary, only in response to the call of its offshore agents, as a means of brutal intervention in Hong Kong’s internal affairs and for its agents in Hong Kong to struggle for political encoding.
Members of the House of Representatives expressed their deep regrets and strongly opposed the U.S. Congress.
Hong Kong is the key trade partner of the United States and the largest source of trade surplus.
Hong Kong’s good rule of law, a fair and free business environment and a clean society make it a good choice for American businessmen.
If the United States passes this bill, in addition to fighting the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself, it will also make the relationship between China and the United States worse and no benefit and harm to itself.
According to the statement, Hong Kong will, as always, implement the "one country two systems" policy, continue to enjoy the rights granted by the basic law and effectively fulfil its obligations.
Whether in the past, now or in the future, Hong Kong will continue to make its appropriate contribution to the international community and international trade.
The European Times that the two seats of the French parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week.
French President Macron has recently claimed that France cannot “accept all” but will also endeavour to “accept properly”.
According to the report, Macron is trying to find a breakthrough on the issue of immigration, slowing down the impact of the upcoming debate.
In a recent interview with Macron during the UN General Debate in New York, he said he hopes to have a real “double-counter” programme in the immigration policy to find a balance between humanity and efficiency.
Macron said, “If France wants to be able to properly accept (immigration), it won’t accept everyone.”
Macron listed the four priorities of the immigration policy: granting asylum as soon as possible to refugees in need of protection; more efficiently promoting immigration integration; receiving and protecting all immigrants entering the French territory; and more efficiently resettling those who are unlawful to enter France.
The question of whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the “National Medical Aid” (AME) system has been the most discussed topic in all sectors.
Macron said he wanted to be able to “evaluate” the system, but not to cancel it, but to make certain restrictions on it.
After Macron's speech, the extreme right-wing "National Alliance" leader Le Pongwa tweeted that Macron's speech was "air speech ".
The right-wing Republican and Senate Chairman Rasher also said that the immigration policy should be discussed in a “reliable” but “realistic” way, and indirectly criticized Macron.
The left-wing Socialist deputy Wallace believes that France should “accept more and better” in the issue of immigration, and criticizes Macron’s “manipulation” of the issue.
The new edition of the Asylum and Immigration Act has been issued for a year, which has led to disputes within the ruling party, but has not been able to calm the right-wing opposition.
In the next 2022 election, the issue of immigration policy will again be the center of the attack of the extreme right, and Macron needs to do something on the issue, but will at the same time take the risk of angrying leftists within the ruling party.
The House of Representatives of the French National Parliament will discuss the immigration policy on 30 September, while the Senate will discuss it on 2 October.
There are signs that China’s A-shares are coming to a “back-buy” and many listed companies are getting out “real gold and silver” to buy back the company’s shares.
According to the statistics of the financial data service provider Eastern Wealth, by the 27th of 2019, the total amount of the A-shared company recovery implementation has exceeded 100 billion yuan (Yuan, below), far above the data of the same period of the year, creating the historic new high of the A-shared recovery funds.
In this regard, Xi Jinping, chairman of Shanghai Mykon Information Consulting Limited Liability Company, said that this year the total value of the stock market is low, with relatively low prices to buy back shares, is beneficial for the listed companies to improve the efficiency of the use of funds, also reflects the will of the listed companies to initially manage the market value and the full cash flow situation, is beneficial to boost the trust of investors.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the stock recovery system, also prompted the listed companies to actively carry out the stock recovery.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Securities Exchange and Shenzhen Securities Exchange issued the rules for the implementation of the recovering shares of the listed companies, providing the listed companies with detailed rules and guidelines for the recovering shares.
In addition, according to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented add-on recruitment plans are mainly focused on the construction industry, the real estate industry, the information technology industry and the manufacturing of electronic equipment.
In addition, in terms of the reimbursement amount, this year there are six listed companies reimbursing the amount of more than 1 billion yuan.
Among them, the first is Ely’s shares, which rebuilds more than 5 billion yuan.
What is the impact of the company’s return to stock on the market?
Zhao Zhi Wang, Deputy Director of the Financial Institute of the People's University of China, said in an interview with the Chinese news agency, the recruitment, on the one hand, shows that the listed companies have a strong economic strength and a better financial condition, are able to maintain the stability of the stock price and give investors confidence; on the other hand, it also shows that the listed companies and their controlled shareholders are responsible for the company, responsible for the market and responsible for the investors.
The first is based on the company’s good operating performance, the latter requires the listed company and its controlled shareholders to have a higher quality.
For the capital market, these are the core elements.
The purchase of the shares of the listed companies is beneficial to boost the trust of investors and to support the price of the shares of the listed companies.
According to the Eastern Securities Research Report estimates, according to the expected number of shares recovered set by the A-share company as a whole since the beginning of this year, as well as the average price calculation of the shares recovered, this year the increase of funds brought to the A-share market is expected to break 150 billion yuan.

山东原寿光县委会秘书王伯祥 — — 强县富民赤子心 — 新华网
Wang Bernhin, Shandong寿光人, born in February 1943, participated in work in 1967, later served as Secretary of the countryside party committee, Secretary of the countryside committee, Mayor and other functions.
In 1986, Wang Born was appointed Secretary of the Shandong Province's Sunshine County Committee, when Sunshine was the poor district of Shandong.
During the five years of life-light office, Wang Bernhard was in the heart of the people, concentrating the strength to do three things: the first is to promote vegetable industrialization; the second is to develop life-north salt-alcohol beach; the third is to turn the basis for the industry, allowing life-light people from that moment to raise their pockets, and stand up the plate.
The life-light farmers have a food tradition, and they have also learned about the food.
At the beginning of the 1980s, life-light farmers wheat yields were not sold and broken in the land.
The research found that the key to catching vegetables is to make good circulation.
Lifelight first built the vegetable wholesale market and opened the beginning of the development of the market economy.
The party members are to lead, break down, and all losses are in the countryside.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Bernhin, 17 members of the party, including Three Yuan Zhu Village Wang Liu, established 17 winter-heated vegetable shelves, and in that year the village had 17 “double-million houses”.
The promoting group was then established in the district, and under the mobilization of Wang Bernhin, Wang Liu was guided tour in various villages; in the first year, it promoted more than 5,000 vegetable shelves, and then the vegetable shelves were pushed to the entire district and even to the nation.
For thousands of years, 1.6 million hectares of land in the south, in addition to the salt-align beach, is the light beach painted.
The lives of local people are very difficult.
Sunny has a vegetable store, what does Sunny do?
Wang Born organized a hundred thousand people to take part in the congress battle, and settled on the desert beach, for a period of fourteen and fifty days.
Wang Bernhin and the countryside's leading staff are all on the workplace, like the civil workers, pushing the car, wind food lounge, the people see them all stretch the finger, thirsty in the eyes admire ... ... At that time, Suu Kyi developed 150,000 acres of shark, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, on the salt algae beach painted the development of the "collective shark ".
In July 1986, Wang Born first attended the Industrial Meeting of the Qingdao City as the Secretary of the County Committee.
During the meeting, a "Digital Industrial Economy Comparison Table" was issued, first view of the industrial GDP value, lifelight is still good, ranked fourth.
But if the raw salt is removed, the purely industrial production value of Life Light remains only 1.9 billion yuan, ranked third in the reverse number.
King Bernhard took over 70 people and ran to the outland “change the brain.”
In less than a year, the entire district has invested 1.5 billion yuan, on 77 projects.
Since then, it has been organized annually to take over to Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai.
There is a shortage of business and a shortage of entrepreneurs.
Wang Bernhin hosted the theme meeting board: in the entire district openly chosen the chief executive, 40 "carriers and talented people" emerged and were pushed to the industrial first line.
In 1991, Suu Kyi entered the country's 100th district ranges, and Wang Bernham was replaced as Deputy Mayor of Suu Kyi City.
He left, more than 200,000 vegetable shelves, 1.2 million hectares of cotton fields, salt fields, shrubs, 4,854, more than 100,000 “million households”, a people-recognised staff.
On 26 September, the Minister of State and Foreign Affairs of the United Nations, Wang Yi, headed the China and the Security Council African members' Foreign Ministers' meeting at the UN headquarters in New York.
The current African Security Council member Cote d'Ivoire Minister of Foreign Affairs Tano, Equatorial Guinea Minister of Foreign Affairs Ojono, South African Minister of Foreign Affairs Pandor and the candidate Member State Minister of Foreign Affairs Niger Kara, and Tunisian Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeshinawi were present at the meeting.
Wang Yi proposed four points on strengthening cooperation between the two sides in the Security Council.
First, to unite the power.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, the direct consequence is that the basic standards of international relations are challenged, the role of the United Nations is impacted, damaging the interests of large-scale developing countries and small and medium-sized countries including African countries.
To tackle this challenge, Central Africa needs hands and shoulders and strength to be united.
In the Security Council, the three African countries spoke in one voice, and the focus was not just three votes, but the entire African continent.
China and Africa stand together, not just four votes, but will drive other countries to follow, influence and shape the agenda of the Security Council.
Since 2018, China and African members of the Security Council have established the “3+1” coordination mechanism to fully use this coordination mechanism.
Second, by consultation to resolve disputes.
China has always advocated political hot-spot solutions, Africa has a good tradition of consultation, and has a successful experience of African regional and sub-regional organizations.
Many of the complex issues on the agenda of the Security Council are especially African hotspots, mostly the root of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
We must jointly use Chapter 6 of the United Nations Charter to play the role of the United Nations in turning, mediating, and so on.
Third, self-confidence is self-confidence.
African countries and people are best aware of Africa’s problems, and Africa is also able and wisely to solve its own problems.
When the Security Council deals with African hotspots, it should focus on listening and respecting the will of Africa, play the role of regional and sub-regional organizations, and encourage and support internal solutions from Africa.
China is willing to strengthen its coordination with the African side and firmly promote the capacity to build Africa’s independent peace operations.
Fourth, based on development.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries, and we must insist on putting economic and social development in the first place and supporting each other on the path of development that each has chosen.
China is willing to co-establish the "Belt and Road" with the African Union's 2063 Agenda, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations, and the African development strategies, to help African countries enhance development capabilities and eliminate the roots of conflict.
We are committed to encouraging the United Nations to increase its investment in Africa’s development.
The Ebola epidemic has again exploded, China has and will continue to support, provide as much human and material assistance as possible, and is willing to coordinate actions with African countries, mobilize the United Nations, the WHO and others to increase aid efforts, and play the role of the United Nations Kongo Stability Special Mission.

Trudeau’s “human building collapse”, can he succeed in re-election?
This time he put Trudeau out of a “great hole” that was just Trudeau’s own hole.
Recently, the Canadian media continued to disclose several old photos of current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which Trudeau dressed himself as a black image.
This is considered to be a clear act of racial discrimination, which has led to a massive wave in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, the Canadian people don’t buy much.
Trudeau took up the stone and hit his feet.
As political critic Riley and others pointed out, since the "anti-Black Face Movement" emerged from the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have highlighted the accusation of opposing parties or persons who have different opinions within the party in this regard of "great loss" and repeatedly claimed "whoever commits this mistake should be immediately dismissed ".
In a simple way, this time it puts Trudeau out of a “great hole” that was just Trudeau’s own a bit of the hole.
Trudeau is the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, a young and beautiful man, who has just broke out a "political idol" turning.
He, who was a “political amateur”, took the head of the Federal Liberal Party and played an unexpected beautiful battle in the 2015 Federal Legislative Elections in Canada — the Federal Liberal Party had a majority of its seats in the Federal House of Representatives, and gained a precious individual cabinet.
During this time, Trudeau proposed a number of surge-and-course political programs and concepts, such as “ethnic and gender equality”, “ecological environmental protection”, “economic revitalization”, emphasizing the elimination of corruption and “the wind of injustice” and so on.
However, during his 5 years of rule, he had almost all the aspects of the above, “High and Low Going”.
With regard to the “ethnic and gender equality” issue, he had no mention of this “black face” event, and he had previously made a series of “make-up and unreasonable” issues about the indigenous people, making indigenous groups and leaders move the protest tents to the Congress Hill Gate on the day of the 150th anniversary of the founding of Canada.
With regard to the elimination of corruption, at the end of last year, Trudeau was involved in the “Ranwaling incident” that was raining.
It was revealed that the construction engineering company "Ranvan Ling" in his homeland had a major violation of private fraud, pressing the departments and officials responsible for the investigation, asking the latter to "high up the hands".
Furthermore, Trudeau became angry with the officials who revealed the misconduct — the former Kingji Di, who was the first to reveal the misconduct and directly conduct the case.
Although the case itself has doubts, its suspicion is difficult to clean up.
Many observers pointed out that the five-year triumph of Trudeau was mainly caused by its own “cave”, and the largest “cave” was not more than the three articles “Tiger Head Snake End”, “Self Eating Its Fruit” and “Long Than Law, Hard Than Law”.
The most authoritative Angus-Rade survey in Canada shows that since 2015, the respondents who supported Trudeau have slown from more than 60% to more than 30%, while the opponents have slown from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Though other opposition parties and their party leaders performed equally badly, even though a significant part of the voters who are still willing to vote for the Federal Liberal Party, they are now unhappy with the federal prime minister and the party leader.
On the 21st of October, the new federal legislative election in Canada is coming to start, and can Trudeau repeat the series that won five years ago?
The answer may be in one word: difficult.
Whether from the competitive level of the enterprise, the level of consumer experience, or from the level of regional aviation integration and development integration, they have a profound impact and positive meaning.
On the 25th of September, Beijing Dongguan International Airport officially arrived.
The New York Times reporter was informed from the Beijing City Development Committee that the capital airport is already in a state of overwhelming operation, the opening of the Dongguan International Airport, will improve the capital air service capacity.
After Shanghai, Beijing became China's second co-city city with two airports, with Shanghai Rainbow Bridge International Airport primarily serving domestic aviation affairs, Pudong Airport is mainly similar to international shipping airports, the future capital airport and Dongguan Airport will also serve domestic and international different aviation operations with differentiated positioning, providing more detailed services.
Dongguan airport transit, from the point of view of business development, has more favourable effects on the capital airport.
The passenger transport in the capital airport in 2018 exceeded 100 million passengers, ranking the country's top, but compared to the rapidly growing business demand, there is still a clear weak power, especially the international routes demand has a big gap.
In order to better serve domestic and foreign passengers tourism, travel and other needs, adapting to Beijing's increasingly open, with international connectivity urban development trends, Dongguan International Airport is placed as a large international center airport, plans to meet the annual passenger transfers of 100 million people and 4 million tons of mail transfers in the future.
Therefore, the two airports are not overlapped, and they have enough market space for different customers, respectively.
From the economic accounting level, the transit of the Dongguan International Airport, will clearly form a double-win effect, relieve the tension of Beijing Air Force, accelerate the growth rate of passengers and cargo transfers, and create the increase in the number of cakes operated by the capital aircraft.
From the user’s point of view, with the transit of the Dongguan International Airport, the future doesn’t have to focus on the capital airport travel, it can also reduce the routes too concentrated bringing a number of problems, such as the transit guarantee time increased, passengers boarding speed slowed, indirectly increased the time of aircraft and passengers stay at the airport, increased the burden of the operation of the airport, reduced the burden of shipping through the capital airport, in fact also improved the travel experience of passengers.
According to the media for traveling to large international airports various traffic routes time and cost estimates, such as from the South Five Ring to Kyiv to the High Speed Direct to Dongguan Airport High Speed, if driving 50 minutes can arrive, oil money comes back about 40 yuan, high speed fee 15 yuan; while choosing the trail traffic metro Dongguan Airport Line, the route according to the distance is 20 km, 30 km is limited, the ticket price is divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan three categories; citizens can also travel to Kyiv City, from Beijing West Station to Dongguan Airport Station only more than 20 minutes.
In general, there are a number of means of transport available for citizens to Dongguan Airport, and the cost and time are also within a more reasonable range.
And from the point of view of the trend development: the position of the Dongguan airport is the transport center of Kyushu, therefore a little away from the city area of Beijing, but strengthened radiation to Hanoi and Tianjin, facilitated more people to travel, significant importance for the economic development of Hanoi and Tianjin.
In the future, Hanoi and Tianjin passengers will be able to enjoy more international airline services offered by Dongguan International Airport, which can be seen in Dongguan Airport's traffic planning.
The transport facilities of the Dongguan Airport are perfect, and in addition to the new airport line directly to the Dongguan Airport in the city of Beijing, there are several highways that connect the Dongguan Airport with the surrounding areas.
This is the same as Guangdong Dongguan, Fukushima, Qingdao and other city passengers can go to Guangzhou White Cloud Airport through Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou and others.
From this can be seen that the transit of the Dongguan International Airport, not only increased several routes and several aircraft, either from the competitive level of the enterprise, the consumer experience level, or from the regional aviation integration and the development integration level, have a profound impact and positive meaning, not only concerns the long-term layout and development of the Beijing shipping industry, for the trip of the large population of Dongguan, to provide a diverse choice, to promote the quality of the Beijing shipping industry services further improving, more favourable to promote the development process of integration of Dongguan, to drive the economic and commercial development of the area around the Dongguan Airport.
Therefore, for the transit of the Dongguan Airport, we are economically not only to account for individual small accounts, but also to account for the overall development of large accounts.

Forum on Economic and Social Affairs in Vietnam 2019
Vice-Director of the Economic Committee of the Vietnam Parliament, Nguyen De Nung, said that early this year, Vietnam’s economic and social development showed many new rises and continued to maintain growth.
The forum focuses on the outstanding economic and social issues in the months before 2019 and proposes measures for economic and social development in the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, the participants exchanged deep views and opinions on four topics, including the economic development of 2019 and the impact of some of the Free Trade Agreements, some of the outstanding issues of the 2019 Vietnam economy, the outstanding issues in the 2019 Vietnam social culture and the forecasts and recommendations on the 2020 Vietnam economic and social development.
Representatives generally believe that in the first months of 2019, global economic growth slowed, risks and challenges increased.
The trade friction between major economies has further decreased global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that despite the uncertainty of the global economy, of which 70% of the world’s economies are in growth stagnation, Vietnam’s economic development has still achieved many favourable achievements, the macroeconomy operates smoothly, the inflation is effectively controlled, the average growth of the population consumer price index in the first half of 2019 is 2.64%, the lowest growth in almost three years.
In the first half of 2019, GDP grew by 6.76%, which was less than 7.05% in the same period last year, but the growth remains a higher level compared to the level in the same period in 2011-2017.
When making forecasts of the 2019-2020 Vietnam economic development trends, Deputy Director of the Vietnam National Economic and Social Forecasts Center, Dundee, said that in the context of the world economic disruption, the 2019 Vietnam economy has a higher growth momentum.
It is expected that by 2020, the macroeconomy of Vietnam will continue to remain basically stable, the implementation of various free trade agreements will promote trade development, economic structure adjustment and business environment improvement work will be further strengthened, due to the impact of trade friction, Vietnam's foreign export activities will show a decline.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring and forecast warning mechanism, to initially seek trade aid measures aimed at Vietnam’s export goods, to find opportunities to expand the new export markets, to facilitate the export of various goods to the foreign countries, such as agricultural water products.
At the same time, the inflation will be controlled at a reasonable level, thus promoting the development of subsidiary industries and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and ecological agriculture.
Liu Zhiji, Director of the Consular Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia at Zhejiang, held a reception meeting on Zhejiang on Monday to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the new China establishment.
Liu Xi Jinping said, China has been actively involved in international affairs for 70 years, contributing more to China's wisdom and China's programmes to improve global economic governance and promote global joint development, contributing significantly to world peace and development, and bringing real benefits to Cambodia's economic development and people's well-being.
As the world’s second-largest economy, China’s contribution to world economic growth is more than 30%, especially China’s “Belt and Road” initiative, cooperation between China’s local provinces and cranberries and provinces continues to deepen.
He said this year is the year of the opening of the 61th anniversary of the establishment of China and Cambodia relations, the two countries have brotherhood and friendship, and China and Cambodia’s mutually beneficial cooperation will become the driving force for local economic and social development.
The Governor of Chongqing Province, Dishah, praised the great achievements of the new China in the past 70 years and congratulated the achievements of friendly cooperation between the two countries.
Disaiha hopes that the two sides will continue to work together to promote friendship and cooperation between China and Cambodia, to strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit and to constantly improve the level of life of the people.
Disayha said that the friendly relations between the Chongqing Province and the various provinces of China are remarkable, so far with the Chongqing 28 provinces have signed friendship relations with the Chongqing City, large cultural performance projects "Wu Gong Smile" and "Wu Gong Dynasty" landed, Chongqing-Gongqing Agricultural Demonstration Park, Chongqing New International Airport Project, Chongqing Province Government officials special training courses, Chongqing scientists travel to China to study scholarships, rural medical clinic, development of the construction of the city area road, Chongqing Chongqing rehabilitation public benefit project "Lighting Line" and other cooperation results, in Cambodia's friendly cooperation, Chongqing people became direct beneficiaries.
The Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defense of Cambodia, Ken Vanson, President of the Council of the Chongqing Province, Oung Heng, Governor of the 5 provinces, Chongqing Council Chongqing Division, Volunteer Teachers, Chongqing Chamber of Commerce of Cambodia, Chinese Investment Enterprises Representatives and Foreign Chongqing Consortium Representatives attended the meeting.
In the Cloud Living Town Witnessing the Decade of Digital China "Cloud Up" - Xinhua Net
If we take the 2009 local website forum as the original point, the 2019 Cloud Habitat Congress held in Hangzhou from 25 to 27 has passed a whole decade.
From the concept of “in the cloud” to the practice of “up to the cloud”, big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies in 10 years to support China’s economic development, social management and public services.
In the Zhejiang Haining New Energy photovoltaic battery workshop, the recent quality inspector has more of a new “college” loaded with Ali Cloud artificial intelligence.
It is 24 hours uninterrupted, the detection speed is more than twice the artificial, and the quality test accuracy is more than 95% stable.
According to the company’s chief, the “quality inspector” with a camera has focused on learning more than 40,000 defective samples, with the cloud computing power behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary languages, and will classify defective batteries.
The company is just a shutdown of the transformation of the cloud computing industry today.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information has published the "Promotion of Enterprise Cloud Implementation Guidelines (2018-2020)", which suggests by 2020, efforts to enterprise cloud awareness and motivation significantly improved, cloud ratio and application depth significantly improved.
Ali Cloud founder Wang Yi said today, data-centered cloud computing has built a bridge and opened the way for the digital economy that data is a key element.
At the same time, in the last 10 years, the size of our cloud computing industry has also continued to expand.
The White Book of Cloud Computing Development (2019) published by the Chinese Information and Communications Institute in July this year shows that the total market size of China Cloud Computing in 2018 reached 962 billion yuan, a growth of 39.2% compared to 2017.
In addition to becoming a key technology to support industrial transformation and the development of the digital economy, the untouchable “cloud” has also unconsciously changed urban management and social life.
This year’s Cloud Living Congress, the “City Brain” that has been presented for three consecutive years, still attracts attention.
The city’s brain has now become the center of urban management from transportation management tools, and related cooperation applications have been extended to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the city brain through powerful computing capabilities, enables new city management services, such as "first parking after payment" and "real-time perception" to be achieved.
In the field of government services, the "one cloud" connects "one thing" and co-operates "to take office" and "to take office" and cloud computing facilitates both ends of government services.
Currently, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform across the province through government clouds.
As of September 11, the platform has already covered the province’s more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities, and has collected data from 3066 categories and 190,8 million data.
The average monthly call and sharing data between the Zhejiang province government departments has reached 12 million times, and every call flow on the cloud may mean that the crowd works less.
Be careful with plastic tea!
A recent study in Canada found that a pack of plastic tea could release billions or even billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastic consumed by a person throughout the year, but there is no evidence to be that plastic particles are a threat to human beings.
Researchers from the University of Magil in Canada found that putting a plastic tea bag in a glass of almost cooked hot water (95 degrees Celsius) releases approximately 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.3 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the glass.
This amount is significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastic consumed by a person throughout the year.
According to a study published earlier in 2019, people consumed at least 50,000 plastic particles a year while breathing the same amount of microplastic.
According to the study published in the Journal of Environmental Sciences and Technology, the researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in the Montreal shops and cafes, opened the tea bags, drank the tea bags in almost dried water for 5 minutes after cleaning, and then analyzed with an electronic microscope and spectrometer.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag releases more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, “the plastic load of other foods is higher than several levels before.”
The majority of the tea bags are made of natural fiber, but many of the natural fiber-made tea bags brands are still using plastic to cover the door.
Some of the brand’s tea bags are now using paper and plastic, and these plastic tea bags are the objects of researchers’ testing.
Plastic particles are small fragments of plastic, and the researchers define these microplastic sizes between 100 nm and 5 cm, generated mainly by plastic waste disintegration.
Researchers found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and the deepest waters around the world, and these microplastics can also be found in water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
In October 2018, the researchers first found plastic particles in human sputum samples in several different regions of the world.
To test the potential toxicity of plastic particles, the Canadian research team placed hydrocarbons in polluted water and found that microplastics could affect the behavior of these hydrocarbons and cause them to develop deformities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence that plastic particles are a threat to human beings.
However, the WHO points out that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread to the environment and what their impact on humans is.
The researchers estimate that these tea bags release a large amount of plastic particles, which may be the reason why these plastic tea bags are in contact with dried water, and that even when "food-class" plastics are heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius, toxic substances may disintegrate or penetrate.
Guterres said the climate emergency is the biggest threat to the survival of the small island countries.
There, a natural catastrophe will ruin the development of a generation.
The disasters in Barbuda, Dominica and Bahamas, which have been affected by the hurricanes since this year, have explained this.
About a quarter of people in small island developing countries live in places with a height of 5 meters or less.
Migration can seriously affect their social and lifestyle and even cause sovereignty and ethnic identity problems.
At the Climate Action Summit on Monday, the small island countries jointly commit to achieving carbon-free and 100% renewable energy by 2030, thus they again lead the world in the right direction.
Guterres said: “The climate crisis is accumulating new injustice over the old injustice.
Although small island developing countries contribute small to global warming, they pay the highest cost.
Because these countries are in the middle-income position, many countries are also in an accelerated and unstable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world has to take action, and now it’s time to make major decisions and make huge investments in small island developing countries.”
Today’s high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for assistance to small island developing countries in managing catastrophic risks, investing in climate-adjusted infrastructures and methods of transition to renewable energy; calling on international institutions to help small island developing countries, especially low-income countries, get funding.
The small island developing countries are on the protection and preservation of the life line of the Earth — the frontline of the ocean.
The latest special report published this week by the Intergovernmental Climate Change Special Committee confirms that the oceans have suffered the serious consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, many regions could happen a few times a year before a century of extreme sea level rising.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become uninhabited without a large amount of funding invested in adaptation.
Pollution, excessive fishing and oxidation caused huge losses.
Over the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all the living corals, and over the past 40 years, plastic pollution has doubled.
The demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a decrease in resources, including the maintenance of fisheries for many island communities.
The small island countries also face high transportation, energy and infrastructure costs.
They are severely dependent on some external markets, making it subject to the price flows.
Some countries are also striving to deal with the security impacts of illegal trafficking in people, weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: “The problem can be solved anywhere by solving a problem in the most challenging environment.
The efforts of the small island developing countries to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons and examples available worldwide.”
He emphasized that small island developing countries are a special example of sustainable development.
They need long-term attention and investment from the entire international community.
The Ministry of Finance says the financial system is liquid enough.
The Minister of Finance of India, Sithalaman, said that the current liquidity of the financial system is sufficient, and that the growth rate of the Indian economy is expected to recover in the second half of the financial year, under the guidance of the festival consumption demand.
It was said after a meeting with representatives of private banks, non-banking financial institutions and housing banks in India.
Sithramann did not explain where these statements were targeted.
Previously, some Indian media and foreign media blamed the continued decline in the current round of the Indian economy for the liquidity tensions in non-banking financial institutions.
Citallaman took the fall in car sales as an example, denying the liquidity tension as the main cause of the fall in sales.
Citallaman noted that the decline in automotive sales was mainly due to cyclic factors.
It is expected that the growth rate of the Indian economy, driven by festival consumption, will recover in the second quarter of the financial year.
The annual shopping season in India begins in September and will last until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will significantly promote Indian economic growth.
The Ministry of Education of the province of Jiangxi has recently issued a notification that it is strictly prohibited that the entire province’s secondary and secondary schools violate supplementary courses during the National Day holiday, and that the organizing staff will be randomly conducted to investigation.

To take good dealers funding implementation, put the importance of domestic well-known large farming enterprises that have not yet entered our province as the importance of dealers funding.
Implement the market circulation system, accelerate the construction of the logistics facilities of the cold chain of pigs, and fully promote the transition from "cutting pigs" to "cutting meat".
To implement the modern anti-epidemian system, all places must be equipped with the basic level anti-epidemian inspection staff that correspond to the size of the cultivation and work tasks, to build the first defense line for the prevention of epidemics.
Loyalty requires to ensure the supply of the meat market, to ensure that there is no large-scale deficiency and large-scale discharge, to ensure that the supply of the big holiday market is stable.
The meeting was also implemented on the continued handling of the prevention of the African swine epidemic, the prohibition of capture of important waters in the province of Guangzhou, and the procurement of midnight rice throughout the province.
Speaking of Motherland, National Soul and Big White Rabbit, Shanghai Old Name Representative for University Students to Party Classes

The video congratulates the 70th anniversary of the new China establishment, also speaks Chinese.
On the 26th local time, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated the People's Republic of China on its 70th anniversary via a video.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good night, I am Shinzo Abe.
In honor of this 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, I wish to express my warm congratulations on behalf of the Japanese government and the people.

“In some workplaces, over-age farmers are estimated to be more than half.
Where do you find young workers?
Not wanting to use so many ‘olds’ on the workplace, there’s no way.”
In recent days, for the phenomenon of the existence of many over-age farmers (over the retirement age) on the workplace, Zhuqui, who has been an engineering contractor for many years in the construction industry, has regretted.
Recently, the high school in which the writer was located carried out the rain waste flow project, a lot of farmers have appeared in the campus, and if you look at it, you will find there are a lot of older farmers.
The out-of-the-country workers of the aged farmers are not “stopped,” but because they are “no-stopped,” with “this must be” unhappiness and difficulties—whether they save money to solve their pension and medical problems, or to help their children, all drives the old people who should have been “stopped” to continue to work hard.
The old-age farmers’ work is not as easy as we can imagine.
To raise children, to raise the elderly, to teach children, to help children build buildings and buy cars, to help children build a family, to isolate their grandchildren, when these farmers have completed the "life task", the pockets have been empty and even a lot of debt, mostly lack wealth accumulation.
In order not to trace their children and to save some wealth to themselves, many farmers’ workers persisted “to work unbeatable.”
Many of the “80s” and “90s” and even “00s” new generations of farmers are unwilling to engage in the difficult conditions, high labor intensity second industry or low-end service industry, causing structural “work disaster”, which is a lack of attractive work, which provides opportunities for older farmers.
Due to the lack of a long skill, physical function and labor capacity decreased again, many older farmers work with great intensity, low income, high risk, and less security.
To be able to do a day, to be able to earn a little more is a little, the difficulty of survival of the older farmers behind the “not free” cannot be ignored and neglected.
To solve the problem of unpaid and remuneration, to improve labor protection, to reduce safety risks, to increase labor income, to improve the survival of older farmers, in addition to their “self-salvation”, they are also unable to separate from the institutional welfare and humanitarian care of the public sector.
Some scientists pointed out that older farmers are unlikely to rely on their home land to solve problems such as their retirement and medical care, and they have to take care of the family by other means.
Reading the uncertainty and strongness of the “not free” age-old farmer workers helps us better understand the love and pain of the age-old farmer workers.
To see the back of the older farmers, to hear their breaths, to think how to try to make them return to the countryside to truly “the old thing” they need the public sector, the market and society to share responsibilities in good-sex interaction, and multi-party cooperation.
Chemezov said that Russia will not export this system in the next five years, because "for the first time it will supply its own armies, then it will export production."
This practice is fully in accordance with international practices.
The main producers of weapons and military equipment always first ensure their own defence needs and then process export orders.
Earlier, Deputy General Commander of the Russian Space Forces, General Yuri Grahov, said the development of the system was about to be completed.
The S-500 system was developed by "King Stone-Antey" Space Defense Conchun.
This is the new generation of air defense systems, adopted the work principle for destroying ballistic and air dynamic targets.
The main role of the S-500 is to block medium-range ballistic missiles, which can block missiles under 3,500 km.
Additionally, according to some data, the S-500 could also destroy high-speed cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of drones, high-speed ultra-speed missiles five times the speed of sound, and even targets located near space.
This weapon can also become a unified network with other air defense systems, especially the S-400 systems, which is very important from a national defense point of view.
Sergey Chemezov expressed special attention to the S-400.
He said the system is currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian army also needs it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 air defense system serves the Arctic Air Defense Force.
According to the news on September 15, the work of the Arctic Air Defense Division on the S-400 air defense missile system has been completed.
This is not the militarization of Russia in the Arctic.
The Russian Defence Ministry said this is a process within the more advanced defence tools transition plan to the north.
The Russian Northern Fleet's news office said: "As the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controllable air area in the Arctic region has grown significantly."
Most importantly, according to military assessments, the system was used successfully in the Arctic and Arctic regions.
Officers of the Air Defense Division were trained on the new system and prepared for entering the battle offices.
Previously it was equipped with the S-300 remote air defense system, and now remains a portion.
When it comes to the air defense system, it must possess weapons that can destroy various air targets, whether the targets of high-end flights outside, or close to the protected facilities of the “flighting fish”.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system developed by Gold Diamond-Antay Space Defense Conchun is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high ultrasound targets and other air-attack weapons.
This weapon can attack air-dynamic targets within 400 km of flight and hit ballistic targets flying 4.8 km per second within 60 km of distance.
Russia is never hiding that it will deploy air defense forces in the Arctic North to ensure the territorial air security of the North Sea.
Recently, the first 12 "Tor - M2DT" air defense missiles were delivered to the Arctic region of Russia, which were enough to form an air defense camp to strengthen the Arctic air defense system.
At the time, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the Arctic "Tor" forces will be expanded to a complete missionary construction in the future.
In addition to the new S-400 remote systems deployed to the New Zealand and the Cora Peninsula, as well as the Pantsir-SA short-range systems deployed in the Arctic region, these advanced air defense weapons strongly defend the Russian Arctic sky.
Enemy’s aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles will be hard to break this defense.
According to the idea of the Russian government, the flagship store will become the platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complex and long process of opening their own stores.
As a Russian shop operator, Russian goods are focused on selling Russian goods in China.
The largest trade platform in China, including Tmall (Tmall), Kyoto (JD), 1688, Pinduoduo (Pinduoduo), Hand Q (ShouQ) and Multifunctional Instant Communication Software (Wechat), has online shops, and has its own online platform Epinduo.com and the Russian commodity retail chain shops.
The Russian Export Center will, in collaboration with Russia, develop stores marketing strategies and criteria for participation, and filter virtual warehouses on board products companies.
The store is scheduled to open up to the end of this year and to be placed on products of at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to data from the Russian Export Center, China’s e-commerce platform has a total visit of 1 billion times a month.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have seen a stable growth since 2014, with more than $1 billion in 2018.
Currently, Alibaba Group will also open a pilot store for the sale of goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the global import strategy framework.
According to Alexei Kochevnikov, the new store will showcase the sales of goods of companies at least over 500 million rubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher than 500 million rubles of sales are still insignificant.
We all know that the Chinese consumer’s attitude towards Russian goods is quite positive, considering our goods as high quality and green environmental products.
Kojovnikov said the competition between Chinese consumers, who are competing for a strong purchasing power, is intense and is still worsening.
He said: “Our goal is ambitious to launch 500 through this store in three years.”
At the same time, the platform will also cover the products of Russian companies in the Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor of the Basic School of Commercial Policy at the Russian University of Economy, said: “This is a political project that represents the image of the two sides, as the Russian export center is a state-owned and not private institution.
“I haven’t seen a lot of highly competitive Russian goods on the market.”
He believes that the project is likely not really to be implemented, but it will help strengthen the relations between the two countries.
Andrey Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Center, said during the Eastern Economic Forum that more than 170 Russian companies’ product information has been published on the largest international wholesale online platform, Alibaba.com, which can be purchased both in China and in other countries.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with the Alibaba Group, a training program for Russian companies by experts from the University of Tobago, whose first seminar was held in July this year.
At the second China International Import Exhibition in Shanghai in November this year, the Russian Export Center will also be the organizer of industrial exhibitions and business projects as Russian enterprises.
A large exhibition will be held in a 1,000 square meters exhibition hall, where it will also be the center of organizing business project events, agreement signing ceremonies, presentations and talks with Chinese business representatives.
About 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The news office of the Russian Export Center said: “In addition to the agricultural exhibition, we will also hold commercial meetings, that is to arrange the establishment of direct contacts between entrepreneurs.
“This is another direction of our efforts, with the aim of supporting the business and ensuring that there are dozens of special meetings for it.”
In addition, the exhibition will also host master classes, cooking competitions and the Russian-American cooking exhibition of the project "Explore the Shanghai Station of Russian cuisine".

New York Times: Stay on our own path.
The White Book of China and the World of the New Age, published on 27 May, replies: China’s development has succeeded in the past 70 years, the main reason is that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found this right path of development of socialism with Chinese characteristics and have steadily followed this path.
China’s path to its own development is the choice of history, the choice of the people.
Since modern times, in the environment of weak poverty and inner concerns, a generation of Gentiles are searching for the way to find the country’s rescue people, and they are going to follow.
However, “the constitutional monarchy, the restoration of the empire, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, the presidential system have been thought, tried, and the result has not been done.”
Until with the Communist Party of China, with the new China, the Chinese people were only in practice to gradually open up a way of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
This path from China is the path of the happiness of the Chinese people, the path of the resurrection of the Chinese people, and the same path of China and the world’s countries’ joint development.
It is because China is on the right path, it can do its own things well, it can become the world’s second-largest economy, the country that contributes to global economic growth, it can continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As the White Paper points out, China’s this path of development, in accordance with China’s state conditions, adapted to the requirements of the time, will show the prospects of light development with the progress of the time.
Back to the past, the Chinese people know how difficult it is to find the right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people appreciate this right path more.
The Chinese understand the reason of South Orange Northern, and understand that suitable for others is not necessarily suitable for themselves, only suitable for themselves is the best.
It is with this path of self-confidence and strategic strength that China has created a miracle.
In the turmoil process of the advance of mankind, the “historical conclusion” was once known.
Today, the success of the socialist path with Chinese characteristics, proclaims the end of the “historical conclusion”, the collapse of the “Chinese collapse theory” and the failure of the “socialist failure theory”.
The success of China has raised the confidence of developing countries in achieving the strength of the rich nation, extended the path of developing countries towards modernization, and provided experience and knowledge for the world’s countries and peoples who both want to accelerate development and want to maintain their own independence, to walk the path in accordance with their national conditions.
The world is rich and colorful.
China has always respected the right of countries to choose the path to their own national conditions.
China will not “import” a foreign model, nor “export” a Chinese model, but will firmly move on its own path, its own continuous development, strengthen government and government exchanges with countries, and make the appropriate contribution to the joint achievement of good government and good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that a founder of a Foodworks supermarket withdrawed a 66-year-old female worker through text messages because he preferred to hire employees from an Asian background, the boss's practice was sharply criticized as "shameful ".
The committee said the way in which Ms. Gail Ayton (Jianbin Wang translated, English name Edie) has been working in the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years is "extremely unfair" and may be a violation of the anti-discrimination law.
Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang took over the store in 2016 and he was “wishing to throw me off” because she was not a Chinese.
In this case, the committee vice president Peter Sams carried out a search on the internet and found "Mr. Wang previously published some recruitment ads on various Australian Chinese employment forums ".
Among the job requirements listed in these positions, one said “Premium Asian women” and the other said “Premium Asian employees”.
The third post says that he is "more inclined to foreigners (the original text is so). "
Mr. Wang throwed Mrs. Ayton out in April this year through a SMS, later said it was due to her absence and a small amount of cash shortage from $5.10 to $30.
But Mr. Sams said that Mr. Wang’s reason for the withdrawal of Mrs. Ayton was weak and lack of evidence.
For three years she was missing only one class, with a “missing amount” of a total of several Australian dollars.
He said Mrs. Ayton was dismissed “is actually not related to her behavior or behavior.”
He said: “I think, with the evidence supported by Mr. Wang’s recruitment advertising, the real motivation for the lawyer to dismiss her was that he was more willing to hire employees with an Asian background.
According to Article 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang’s behavior on the surface constitutes a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or a dismissal of the applicant is illegal.”
Mr. Sams said that it was not suitable for Mr. Wang to consider Mr. Ayton’s “happy hearing” treatment, he considered to restore her position.
He should consider paying a compensation to Mrs. Ayton, who is a temporary worker with an hourly salary of 26 AUSD.
Given actions that may violate anti-discrimination and labour law, Sams said he will submit his decisions and documents to the committee’s chief to consider whether Mr. Wang’s actions should be transferred to other bodies to investigate actions that may violate state or federal law.
He said Mr. Wang did not give Mrs. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reason for her dismissal.
He said: “I think that the applicant has taken an unrecoverable injustice and a prejudice procedure to dismiss the applicant, Mr. Wang “ awaits” the opportunity, he believes that this will ‘prove’ the termination of the applicant’ employment is legitimate.”
“He was wrong ... ... the lawyer completely neglected any natural fair treatment given to her when the applicant was dismissed, and it was surprising that he was dishonest and extremely unfair.”
Mr. Sams said, although Foodworks is a small business, “but it must be honestly said that any fair employer will not dismiss employees in the extreme unfair and unfair way recognized in this case.”
He said, “This is shameful, and it is very unfair.”

The bright shots, unique olive green and bright red shoulders together make up a bright landscape.
A few days ago, the journalists entered this group and felt the determination of the military officers to always be the party and the people’s faithful guardians and their “honour to the top” feelings and pursuit.
“Dream brilliant life, writing the immortal legends of the New Age ...” is a group song created by the Army Officers – The Companion with the Motherland.
In the team, this song is the motto of each team member.
The height of 1.92 meters is clear, standing in the squad is especially visible.
As the engine flagman of the Flag Guard, he has a deeper moment of understanding of honor.
The honor of the soldier comes from hard training.
As a motor flagman, the training has been a high standard and strict requirement.
He binds the sand bag to the form of exercise, carries the second table to the speed of exercise, holds the eyes to the stage, and is stable with the wind.
In his "engine flag career" there is a picture that is always unforgettable.
Once the flagship ceremony, the rain falls down, and the tourists who come to watch the flagship ceremony, no one leaves.

Vietnam needs to take advantage of the development of artificial intelligence.
The four criteria used to evaluate and rank cities to face AI wave preparation levels include prospects, achievement capacity, asset base and development direction.
Singapore is ranked first, followed by cities in the UK, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an expert in the organization, said in an interview with Mosin Bewan: “I feel very meaningful when reviewing and evaluating cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.
Overall, I think the future of Vietnam is very bright in the context of a high rate of growth, a strong path to economic development and a fast development of talent.
I think Vietnam has gone the right path and has done well.
It is important that Vietnam should know how to take advantage of the opportunities brought by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to drive the economy to further development.”
Artificial intelligence is completely changing people’s work, communication and lifestyle.
It brings higher efficiency, but also increases the threat of social, economic and technological inequality.
However, according to a global study by Oliver Wyman, only any city in the world today is ready for the breakthrough of the AI era.

Nearly 800 million people travel to China for tourism
About 800 million people will travel in the upcoming "11" Golden Week!
Big data from several tourism platforms show that the demand for the tourism consumer market in China is prosperous.
The National Day Tourism Report predicts, referring to the previous National Day tourism statistics, it is expected that this year National Day holiday domestic tourists will be approximately 800 million; there will also be more than 7.5 million exit tourists.
Currently, tourists from more than 500 cities have booked with group tour, free tour, custom tourism, local entertainment and other products through the platform, involving 100 countries and regions.
According to the China Institute of Tourism estimates, the total national reception of domestic tourists during the National Day holiday last year was 7.26 billion times, compared to a growth of 9.43%.
This year’s National Day holiday will not only increase the number of tourists, but the consumption upgrade will also become the “main melody” of the National Day holiday tour.
The national holiday tourist per capita costs more than 3,000 yuan, compared to the same period last year, which is due to tourists generally choosing to experience better products, such as high-ranking brand hotels, no shopping tourist groups, sophisticated small groups, specialized cars, etc.
The reserve data shows similar trends, the domestic long-line full-time use of comfortable vehicles, the "private group" of less than ten people is more popular than the previous years.
Spring Autumn tourism data show that its consumers prefer heavy experience, heavy service, heavy differentiation “from slow line”.
The data show that the number of reservations of tourists in China's four lines and the following cities grows the fastest, compared to the growth rate of 30%, reflecting more regions in the country's population consumption upgrades.
Personalization is a big feature of this year’s “11” Golden Week tourism.
Traffic data show that national holiday car rental self-driving orders are expected to grow by 60%, short-riding self-driving tracks in the surrounding small-scale routes continue to be hot; the number of registered members of the private group is expected to grow by up to 155%.
Sharing joy becomes the main purpose of tourism.
Traffic data show that 28% of national holiday tourists are family guests, 25% are couples and 23% are colleagues and friends.
In terms of the age of tourists, “80 after” and “90 after” account for more than 50 percent of the total number of tourists.
It is remarkable that, unlike the previous Golden Week exit growth faster, this year’s domestic tourism market performance is more “looking”.
The data show that this year the number of people booked domestic travel routes for National Day holidays increased by 42% compared to the number of people booked domestic travel routes.
Industry analysis, while demand is high, promotes reforms on the tourist supply side across the country, providing tourists with a more rich "cultural tourism".
For example, the National Sports General Bureau, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism today jointly published "2019 Golden Week Sports Tourism Excellence Lines"; the 2019 Shanghai Tourism Festival launched 7 plots of 100 cultural and tourist activities that attract Chinese and foreign tourists to participate; close to the Golden Week, Hunan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong and several provinces have launched a ticket price reduction or free measures.
Travel booking data show that the country’s most “fire” destinations with unique natural landscapes or cultural characteristics, Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xi’an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin will be the most popular domestic tourist destinations.

The world's oldest hairdresser died at age 108 after he cut his hair for 96 years.
Anthony Mancinelli, the world’s oldest hairdresser, who has been recognized as the world’s highest record, has never retired every day for his guest hairdresser, but Mancinelli has died on the 19th of May due to a complication of cancer, saying goodbye to his 96-year-old haircut life.
According to CNN, Mancini migrated to the U.S. at the age of eight, after a short time in a hairstylist helping to clean the floor, and at the age of 12, he began to take a cutting knife to serve guests, thereby mitigating the economic pressure in the house.
Mancini was in primary school at that time, but later did not graduate.
Mancini’s son Robert reveals that his father loves work, and people from all over the world like him, but his father, though he’s always healthy, was diagnosed with cancer in February this year, six weeks before his death finally failed to work because of physical factors, but that’s not a retirement, because he planned to wait for himself to get better and to get back to cut his hair.
Robert, 82, said he had to find a new hairdresser after his father’s death, because he had been helping his father cut his hair throughout his life.
In the course of the year, the company recovered over 100 billion yuan in history.
In order to stabilize the company’s stock price, maintain the company’s image, the listed company in the past two years began frequently recovering shares, through oriented recovering, gathering competitive price transactions, and other ways, hopes to transmit the company’s value to the market, thus stabilizing the stock price, enhancing the trust of investors.
Eastern Fortune Choice data show that in 2017 the funds used by the listed companies to recover shares were 7.9 billion yuan, in 2018 sharply increased to 51.1 billion yuan, since 2019, the total amount implemented by the listed companies to recover shares has exceeded 100 billion yuan, creating a new high in the amount of funds used to recover shares, and far above the previous year.
From the purpose of the recovery, the company's recovery shares appear to be the same as large shareholders, but there are great differences in the implementation of the subject, the source of funds, the purpose of the recovery, the interests of the shares themselves, etc.
Xi Jinping, chairman of Shanghai Mykon Information Consultancy Limited Liability Company, said in an interview with the "Securities Daily" journalist that in November 2018 the "opinion on support for the recovery of shares of the listed companies" was modified to address the problems of the existing system, such as the shares recovery range is narrow, the decision-making process is complex, the stock system is unsatisfaced, since previously from the point of view of the policy began to encourage the listed companies to recover shares, therefore the recovery of shares in that year significantly increased.
In January of this year, the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board.
After the opinion was made, the listed company performed the operation of the return of shares, has more applicable circumstances, the return process is easier, the return of shares is also more motivated.
Return of shares in relatively low positions is also beneficial for the listed companies to improve the efficiency of use of funds, thus increasing the profit rate for each share, increasing the net asset return rate, and reducing the pressure of the company’s profit indicators.
Compared to large shareholders, the importance of re-buy shares of the listed companies is greater, and it also reflects the willingness of the listed companies to actively manage market value and cash flows.
Xi Jinping believes that the price of shares is underestimated as the main factor in the recovery of the listed companies, the company’s shares are no longer able to reflect the company’s future development prospects, so such companies are worth the attention of investors, but cannot blindly invest, need to pay attention to the financial statements of such listed companies as well as the specific operating situation.
The listed companies with a large-scale recovery behavior, at least demonstrates the company’s development trust and financial strength.
The enthusiasm for the recovery of a stock marketed company has gradually warmed, and it has normalized the recovery behavior, and the data show that a thousand stock marketed companies have already implemented the recovery of shares this year, and the leading companies in various industries have become the main power of the recovery market.
China Pyongyang recently revealed the recovery progress that the company has recovered A shares of 5.759 million shares, representing 0.315% of the company’s total capital, the total amount of funds paid is 5 billion yuan (not transaction costs), the recovery shares will all be used for the employees’ shareholding plan, including but not limited to the company’s shareholders’ congress has reviewed the long-term service plan.
Ely's shares have paid 57.92 billion yuan for shares recovery, and in recent times the use of shares recovery has been adjusted, from the original plan "shares recovery will all be used as a source of shares for the subsequent implementation of shares incentives" to "accumulated recovery of 1.83 billion shares, of which 1.52 billion shares are used for the implementation of shares incentives, the remaining 3.49 million shares will be used for cancellation to reduce registered capital ".
Ely said the cancellation of part of the returned shares would help to further increase the revenue level for each share and effectively increase the revenue of the company’s shareholders.
TCL Group announced on September 25 the recovery progress announcement showing that TCL Group recovered 3.59% of the company’s shares, costing a total of 16.5 billion yuan.
The TCL Group’s Board Office told The Securities Daily that the recovered shares will be used for employees’ holding plans, stock motivation or for the conversion of company bonds that can be issued to shares by listed companies.
TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, continuously improving competitiveness and sustained and healthy development.
Based on the confidence in the company's future development and the maintenance of the interests of investors, combined with the performance of the company's shares in the second market in the past year, and comprehensive consideration of factors such as the company's operating situation and financial situation, the company plans to recover the company's shares using its own funds, its own funding and other methods of funding.
Former Open Source Fund chief economist Yang DeLong said that the operation of marketed companies recovering shares, on the one hand, can reduce the number of shares circulating in the market, increase the profit per share of the marketed companies, is an important benefit for the stock price of the second market; in addition, marketed companies are willing to initially extract real gold and silver, from the stock market recovering shares cancellation, which greatly boosts the market confidence.
The recruitment of domestic companies has increased gradually in the last few years, especially in performance, and it is a very good way to boost the trust of investors through the recruitment of shares, as well as a practical assertion and encouragement.
Hunan Provincial Committee Standing Committee, Long Sao City Committee Secretary Hu Bong Hua and Engineering Machinery Manufacturing Shaw Army's four main doors - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Building the world’s leading level of engineering machinery industry group in Long Sao, using now fashionable words, is to create “the strongest ground surface”.
As a city of the Inland Provincial Council, Long Sao screams this great word, what is the bottom?
by the power of the heavens.
The four engineering machinery Shanghai, which took part in this dialogue, one hand, covers the entire area of heaven, underground, sea and land: mountainous intelligent light aircraft, Cisco heavy department concrete transport pump, three-year-old ground heating machine, iron-building heavy work tunnel shield machine, its "hard power" can be called single-step heating, arrogance.
Since then, China has no right of speech in the field of engineering machinery manufacturing.
Time transition is easy, Chinese companies “introduce” “go out” double wheels drive, ride the East Wind of the “Belt and Road” initiative, acquisition, merger, establishment of factories and other measures, and jump to become the top of the global engineering machinery industry.
Among them, the leading engineering machinery enterprises, such as Three Heavy Industries, China Union Heavy Industries, Iron Construction Heavy Industries, Mountain River Intelligence, their production value, market occupation rate, sales and other major economic indicators, have significantly led the same type of enterprises.
It is the time that the camera moves.
Engineering Machinery Shanghai "Four Great Qingdao", is the leader of the Long Sao Engineering Machinery Industry Group, and also the leading enterprise of the global Engineering Machinery Industry.
In the global industry’s river lake, who survives and lives well, is the hard gas of speaking.
In the early years, the global engineering machinery industry suffered cold winter, many international renowned engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises have fallen down, but the long sand engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises put "cats winter" as "winter swimming" , self-added pressure, self-breaking, through industrial structure transformation, from manufacturing to intellectual transformation, not only the past, but the body bone is stronger.
With the stars of the moon, the government has given the power.
The development of advanced industries requires both the business to move forward and the government to act actively.
The reason that Long Sao has the reputation of the "engineering machinery capital" is that it has gathered the entire industrial chain from up to down, created many related industrial groups, and by optimizing the business environment, improving support services, simplifying the approval process, the development, manufacturing and sales costs of the company are significantly reduced.
Good business environment, allowing engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises to come to thin.
History has pushed Long Sao to the front stage of building the world’s leading level of engineering machinery, when it’s not me, when it’s not me.
Both the government, or the enterprise, and even the related production researchers and other branches, should take advantage of the opportunities, move up, catch the goals, continue to work, and contribute to the construction of the manufacturing power of Hunan.
Wang Yi is the chairman of China and the African members of the Security Council.

Wang Yi said Africa is China’s most important and trusted partner.
As a permanent member, the vote of China in the Security Council has always belonged to a wide range of developing countries, including African countries.

Gansu Qing Sun: Lake Sheep is coming to “defeat poverty”.
The autumn of September rendered the Yellow Land Highlands.
The 58-year-old village citizen, Shavili, filled the cottage in the sheep circle with the last grass, kept on the side of the cottage, and looked at the white lake sheep with a thick mouth.
“It’s nice, until the autumn winter is full, the bar can be sold for a good price.”
Shevily said he feeds “special nutritional meals” every day, regularly cleansing hygiene, antibacterial disinfection, and carefully serving without hesitation.
Shevily has been raising sheep for more than 20 years, until he came to the co-operation to work, until he knew how hard the sheep was in the past.
Shevili is a resident of the Shaykh Bay village of Shaykh Bay in the province of Gansu.
His left neighbor's right shelter is a shepherd, but it adheres to the traditional method of breeding, sheep quality is poor, and the shelter is small.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor people in the village joined the co-operative, and everything began to change.
Sheville was working on the cultivation throughout the day, because he was always in the heart.
The people who entered the shares were poor people, they all held the sheep to the co-operative, can they split the red and sell the price at the end of the year, but they all expect him.
Well under the guidance of the technicians, he slowly learned to deal with the prevention of the epidemic, mastered the science of nutrition, and became the village for a few "good fashion" cultivation.
The professional co-operation is a standardized co-operation, with a total of 16 sheep shops and 1,400 lake sheep.
Co-operative chief Zhou Tao said that the standardized sheep cabin inside and outside, there are many doors.
“The sheep is thick, easily bacterial, the sheep cannot stay in a hot and wet place, the sheep shelf must be built in a three-sided corner place, and must also be installed on a ventilator to ventilate the heat.”
Zhu Tao said, in order to prevent the epidemic, it is also necessary to regularly disinfect the sheep's spray, and to the sheep a quarter three to four anti-epidemic jar.
"Little Fatty Sheep" in addition to living well, it is also to eat herbs mixed with corn, grapefruit, grapefruit, and so on, and there is sufficiently wide "playing field" to shape the muscles.
The co-operations take the measures of hosting the reproduction, and guide local farmers to put good species of lake sheep here, unifying the breeding, management, sales, and achieving good variety, scientificization, standardization, and intensive breeding.
Today, 140 poor households with sheep shares, each household has more than 6,000 yuan per year, and four of them work in co-operations.
From “full mountain breeding” to “precision breeding”, from “local coaching” to “artificial fertilization”, from “looking the body, touching the stomach” to “by one doing B super” ... in Gansu, breeding is not just a shift in the way of breeding, the model of “Longhead Enterprise + Co-operation + Farmers” has also changed the landscape of once “the mountains breeding, the markets selling sheep”, overcome the weakness of traditional farming, the poor days of the farmers because of modern breeding sheep becomes better.
Zhou said if the market price is weak, the local leading company Gansu Zhengzhou Agriculture Development Limited, will buy it at a market protection price of 27 yuan per kilogram, helping farmers spread market risks.
Guangzhou Chongqing Agriculture Development Limited's general adviser, Xu Zhongqing, said that by providing loans guarantees, sheep supply, order farming, offer purchases, unified processing sales and other services to the poor, companies will drive more and more poor households to read "The Sheep Book".
At Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have achieved a stable increase in revenue through the “member” of the Zhejiang farmers’ breeding, good breeding, large-scale breeding, massacre division, and market sales.
The city of Qingyang is located in the northern farms and has rich grass resources.
Currently there are 913 large-scale sheep farms, co-operations, more than 5 million sheep breeds, and two 1.3 million sheep massacre-scale processing production lines have been built, the sheep group is becoming the country’s industry’s “leader sheep” for poverty reduction.
The French Finance Minister says it will cut more than a billion euros next year and calls on Germany to follow.
France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France will reduce taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, while Germany should follow the French financial stimulation rate to revive the declined economy.
In the presentation of France’s 2020 budget, LeMaire said that the latest monetary relief initiative of the European Central Bank has created an opportunity for the governments of the Member States to increase their investment.
The European Central Bank (ECB) dropped its interest rates to a record low on September 12 and plans to reboot debt purchases to lower loans costs, hoping to stimulate economic recovery and boost inflation.
“Low interest rates will not bring Europe to prosperity again, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough,” Lemmer told reporters.
“Germany needs to invest, it is now necessary, the earlier it is better, do not wait until the situation becomes worse and again action,” he added.
He has repeatedly appealed to Germany.
France has implemented a tax reduction of more than €10 billion this year, bringing a significant boost to French economic growth.
The global economy loses its power, and the German economy, which is dependent on exports, is in the first place.
Lemmer said the tax burden for the French family will be reduced by €9.3 billion next year, including €5 billion income tax deductions.
Furthermore, as the corporate tax rate will be gradually implemented from 33.3% to 25%, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by 1 billion euros over the course of five years.

Research: National Healthy Food Index in the U.S. is small but still challenging
According to the U.S. News Network, a recent study in the U.S. shows that in 16 years, the U.S. government’s healthy diet index has grown moderately, from 56 to 58.
But if the full score is 100 points, it is not worth celebrating.
The Americans are still facing a “significant challenge” in their diet.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Feng, a nutritional researcher at the University of Tafts, Massachusetts, said that Americans still consume excessive foods that may cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other diseases, which are the most common diseases in the United States.
The study was published in the Journal of the American Society of Medicine.
The study is based on the conclusions of a health survey conducted by the U.S. government on 440,000 adults between 1999 and 2016.
The authors write, “in spite of significant improvements, significant dietary challenges still exist.”
These challenges include reducing U.S. citizens’ consumption of foods that contain saturated fat, hot dogs, fat cows and butter.
Studies found that people's daily diet increased their intake of these unhealthy fats from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended 10% maximum intake.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet is that the sugar intake is reduced from 16% to approximately 14%, but the intake remains too high.
Officials believe that in the daily diet, the added sugar intake should be less than 10%.
For the reasons for the reduction in sugar intake, researchers believe that it is related to the reduction in people drinking sweet water, but Zhang Aroma emphasizes that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and tomato sauce.
Adults in the United States have a slight increase in the consumption of fruits, nuts, peanut butter and other whole grain categories.
However, 2016 data show that these foods are still less than 5% in the daily diet.
Although people’s salt consumption was slightly reduced, and the reduction in drinking fruit juice led to low-quality carbohydrate consumption, Zhang Aroma said they still accounted for up to 42% of their daily calories, many of which came from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on individual health surveys every two years, which will enable adults to remember what they’ve eaten in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have been divided into two questions every few days since 2003.
The government’s public diet guidelines recommend that people take a “healthy diet” to reduce the possibility of developing chronic diseases.
The guidelines indicate that people should consume more nutrient-intensive foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, as well as seafood, lean meat, poultry, egg, and seed foods that can provide protein.
During the study, the number of people with diabetes in the U.S. has almost doubled, more than 7%, and the obesity rate has also increased in many years between the study — now approximately 70% of adults in the U.S. are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the main cause of death of American citizens.

“The shell is all on the shell floor, because the shell floor is more broken, the water cannot stop, the flow from up to down is constantly, how deep the shell is, how big the water pressure is.”
The General Engineer of the Dary Railway Project Department of the Central Railway Tunnel Bureau, S.S.S.T. told reporters that during the construction of the hole, several times occurred turmoil flooding, collapse and other dangers, the building party invited experts to put the pulse on the site, more than 20 times discussed the processing program.
“When the greatest flow of water in the basin, more than 300 cubic meters per hour, more than 700 meters deep basin, the water pressure is equal to 700 meters deep sea bottom.”
He said, “If we don’t get water out in time, one hour will dive 10 meters, we’re almost 85% of the time spent on water healing, and 15% of the time spent on mining.”
In order to overcome the geological difficulties of the 1st river rocks and rocks and rocks, to overcome the geological difficulties of the 1st river rocks and rocks and rocks, the tunnel construction uses the systemic water treatment measures combined with "detection, note, grabbing" to reduce the construction risk.
After several improvements, the 1st grid construction formed the mechanized flow of water lines, such as the mining system, the mining system, the hanging system, the lifting system, achieved the entire process of mechanization of the work, such as the eye, explosion, mining, template installation, concrete grid construction, and accelerated the construction progress.
Finally, after more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, the cave was successfully completed with a depth of 762.59 meters.
During 330 km, the Dary Railway is an important component of the Central Myanmar International Canal and is an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the "Belt and Road" construction.

Will Mawar be elected to the Danube Council of the Republic of Yugoslavia?
Mawar General Chairman Nathalie Sriwe Family: “The Supreme Council of the Transnational Front discusses!”
The Danube Bibi State Seat replacement is that whether the National Front member Party of the Mawar is on this traditional State Seat is concerned.
However, after the meeting, the MAVC announced that it was transferred to the National Front Supreme Council to decide whether the traditional MAVC seat would continue to be transferred to the MAVC or transferred to the other member parties.
On Thursday afternoon, after the chairman of the meeting of the Mawar Central Committee, Wei said to the media that any supplementary election, the National Front will be carried out in accordance with the Standard Operational Procedure (SOP), even after the meeting of the National Front's Supreme Council, can be resolved.

Asking whether the Mawar will continue to attend this traditional parliamentary seat to the National Front Supreme Council, Wei Family reiterated that he as the Mawar General Chairman must act according to the standard operational procedure, therefore any decision must reach the National Front consensus.
“In any sub-election, someone is willing to go out, there are political parties, somehow they think they should go out, that’s a common thing.”

“This is a big test for us to form a political alliance over the years, and we believe that the National Front is going along and holds some precious values.”
“In this process, maybe someone will say something, that’s strange.

A village resident in Lake North Pukong County was sentenced for hunting wild animals, while ordering it to compensate for ecological resources environmental damage repair costs of 15420 yuan (Yuan, sub) .
Due to the defendant’s family poverty, the prosecutor’s body activated alternative labour compensation and ecological repair costs, achieving organic unification of legal effects and social effects.
The Deputy Prosecutor of the Pukong County Prosecutor's Office, Wang Liu Liu, presented that through three months of "obligatory tour" and other alternative work, the accused has built deep feelings with wild monkeys, and is deeply guilty of previous hunting animals behavior.
On June 21, this year, a criminal associated civil and public proceedings in the field of ecological resources, which was submitted by the Polish District Prosecutor's Board, were openly trialed in the County Court and ruled by the court.

The United Nations awarded the “Guardians of the Earth” award for the “Morms Forest”
In warm praise and rejuvenating music, the project’s chief, Chu Feng, and the user representative, Shin Feng, went up to the awards and received the 2019 United Nations “Guardians of the Earth” award from the hosts.
The 2019 World Guard Awards award ceremony took place in New York on 26th, USA, and the “Murricorn Forest” project, which has driven hundreds of millions of people to take part in the environmental protection campaign, has won the “Inspiration and Action Award” award.
A week ago, the UN Environmental Planning Agency had announced the winners’ list at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but those who attended the award ceremony on that day were still difficult to hide.
In an interview with the news agency, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environmental Planning Agency, Inge Anoson, said “The Mormon Forest” is an exciting innovation that allows hundreds of millions of people to take action to understand the environmental challenges faced by humans and what humans can do for the environment.
It connects people and the environment with technology, allowing every individual to participate in the action to protect the Earth, which will have a huge impact.
The “Morms Forest” was launched by the Chinese Morms Financial Services Group (currently called Morms Goldwear) in August 2016 on the Payment Treasury Platform, users save “green energy” by recording their daily travel in the “Morms Forest” and paying water electricity online, and “green energy” in their mobile phones.
Every user who grows a virtual tree, the “Morms Forest” and the public service partners will plant a real tree in the deserted areas.
As of August this year, 500 million “Morms Forest” users have reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 1.2 billion trees in deserted areas.
In the “Guardians of the Earth” awarded on the same day, Costa Rica won the prize for its national efforts to protect the environment, and the award-winning Costa Rica President Carlos Alvarado praised the contribution of the “Morms Forest” on the site, “willing to inspire so many people to participate in the Green Operation, making them impressive.”
Mr. Myrtle Goldman Sachs chairman and chief executive, Mr. Myrtle Goldman Sachs, said the “Guardians Award” is the confirmation of the “Myrtle Forest” project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for people to participate in a low-carbon life, and this honor belongs to all participants.
In the last three years, the “Morms Forest” has affected 500 million people, and in the next three years the goal of the “Morms Forest” is to drive a billion people around the world to participate in low-carbon operations.
While fighting desertification and protecting the environment, they also explore how to make the farmers’ income more source of green water.
In addition to providing employment opportunities through planting trees, we also want to help farmers make increased revenue through agricultural product development projects, e-commerce platforms and so on.
The public benefit environmental model created on the basis of digital technology is also successful out of the sea and is exploited by other countries.
In June this year, the Philippines’ largest “electronic wallet” GCash launched the Philippine version of “Morms Forest”, encouraging Philippine users to better protect the environment through a low-carbon life.
GCash will work with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and the Environmental Public Benefit Organization and plan to plant 36,50,000 trees in the territory of the Philippines within a year of the project launch.
The Earth Guard Award is the highest award in the field of environmental protection of the United Nations, which is awarded once a year.
The award was awarded after the Chinese Seehandam Forest Builder, the Zhejiang Province of China’s “千村示范,万村整治” project, the green innovation project from China for the third year in a row received the “motivation and action award” award.
The economic and trade friction affects the U.S. economy’s “performance list”.
The U.S. Economic Results for the second quarter of this year show that the decline in private sector investments and exports has led to a significant slowdown in U.S. GDP growth compared to the previous quarter.
Analysts pointed out that economic and trade friction and its uncertainty were the main cause of private sector investment and export decline in the second quarter.
The final amendments published by the U.S. Department of Commerce show that the U.S. GDP increased by 2% in the second quarter by an annual rate, stagnant with the previously published amendments, but significantly lower than 3.1% in the first quarter.
Data show that consumption growth has become the main factor in supporting U.S. economic growth in the second quarter.
The individual consumption spending, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the total U.S. economy, increased by 4.6 per cent during the quarter, attracting economic growth of 3.03 per cent points.
In addition, government consumption spending and investment driven economic growth by 0.82 percent points.
However, private sector investments in the second quarter fell 6.3 percent compared to the previous quarter, slowing economic growth by 1.16 percentage points; exports fell 5.7 percent compared to the previous quarter, net exports slowing economic growth by 0.68 percentage points.
Barry Knapp, a managerial partner at the American Enseed Macroeconomic Consulting Company, said private sector investment not only failed to maintain the growth momentum last year, but also had a significant decline, which was due to economic friction and increased uncertainty that hit corporate trust.
Knapp believes that under the influence of policy uncertainty, U.S. corporate capital spending is expected to continue to decline next year.
Analysts believe that although consumption growth formed a strong support for the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are increasingly more signs that economic frequencies and their uncertainty have affected consumer confidence and have a negative impact on the U.S. consumption prospects.
Richard Curtin, head of the survey and professor of economics at the University of Michigan, said that in a recent survey, 38% of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative effects of tariffs on the U.S. economy, a new high in a year and a half.
With regard to the future of the U.S. economy, analysts generally believe the U.S. economy will continue to slow down.
But experts say that if economic and trade friction is relieved, the performance of the U.S. industrial sector and the financial markets will be improved.
Global economist Catherine Burch predicts that the future U.S. economy will continue to slow down since this year, with growth going to a lower level than in the second quarter.
Moody's chief economist Mark Zandy predicts that the growth rate of the U.S. economy will be 2.3 percent this year and will slow further to 1.6 percent next year, with the assumption that the economic and trade friction will not continue to rise.
Pattnan Investment Company Investment Manager Ellen Hachin pointed out that the company’s current biggest concern is the economic and trade disputes and their uncertainty, if the economic and trade disputes can be solved, the uncertainty will be significantly reduced, and the industry sector will be much better than now.
Matt Melly, a share strategist at Miller-Tabac Asset Management, said that economic and trade friction remains the "first issue" and is also the main cause of the significant volatility of the U.S. capital market this year, and whether economic and trade friction can be solved properly, will be the key to influencing the U.S. capital market direction over the rest of this year.
Parents of 0 to 3 years old parents can leave 10 days a year.
The protection of women’s legitimate rights and interests is a manifestation of respect and protection of human rights and is an important sign of social civilization progress.
On 27 September, in the 15th meeting of the People's General Assembly of the 12th National Autonomous Region of Ningxia, the "Regulations for the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests of the National Autonomous Region of Ningxia" was passed by a high vote.
This is a comprehensive system of local regulations for the protection of women’s legitimate rights and interests, adopted by the first province of Ningxia, which will be officially implemented from 1 November 2019.
It is understood that this Regulation was re-modified on the basis of the 2007 Nizhny Novgorod Implementation of the Women's Rights and Interests Protection Act, divided into Chapter 9 of Article 65, including general rules, political rights, cultural education rights, labour and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marriage family rights, legal responsibility and annexes.
In the Rules, Ningxia encourages exploring the implementation of couples' joint child leave, which is still the first in the country.
The guidelines for the promotion of the development of child care services under 3 years of age, issued by the General Office of the Council of Ministers in April of this year, have relevant descriptions on couples' joint childbirth.
In the process of amending the Rules, the Innovation proposed "to encourage employment units to the couples that comply with the laws and regulations to raise children, in the period of the child's age of 0 to 3 years, each year give the couples each ten days of joint childhood leave."
At the same time, the regulations highlight anti-sex harassment and protection of women minors.
Article 43 of the Rules, which incorporates the latest legislative results in the current personal rights edition of the Chinese Civil Code, detailed the requirements of sexual harassment, the subjects and mechanisms of anti-sex harassment, etc.
Article 44 of the Regulation expressly prohibits the frequent sexual abuse of girls and requires that educational institutions carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work to become a new mark in local legislation for the protection of girls.
With regard to the right of women to know and process the common property of the married family, Article 35 of the Regulation clearly stipulates the right of women to know the common property and the obligations of the registration agency and the relevant subjects to provide solid systemic support for women’s rights to defend.
In addition, addressing the social hot points — — gender discrimination in employment, Article 26 of the Regulation prohibits not only direct discrimination, but also prohibits indirect discrimination, and absorbs the latest convention practical experience, increases the punishment of gender discrimination violations, and stronger protects the legitimate rights and interests of women.
In recent years, the joint public inspection court, civil affairs and other departments have achieved significant results in promoting and introducing social professional forces to participate in marriage and family conflict dispute mediation and anti-family violence work.
The Regulation summarizes and enhances this, and in several articles of the law encourages mobilization of social forces, accumulation of social resources and joint protection of women’s rights and interests, and requires that the people’s governments at the province level and above provide stable, institutional guarantees and support by means of purchasing services.

The Minister of Finance Liu Qing said that so far, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of some state-owned capital to the Social Security Fund, and the total transfer of state-owned capital is approximately 860.1 billion yuan.
Liu Qing made the aforementioned statements at the meeting of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security jointly held by the Ministry of Human Resources and the State Capital Committee on the implementation of the work tasks of the State-owned capital and the Social Security Fund.
“Transforming part of the state-owned capital into the Social Insurance Fund is an important initiative for reform and improvement of the basic pension insurance system, is a full manifestation of the general share of the results of the development of state-owned enterprises and the general equality of the basic pension insurance system, is a policy measure based on the current and long-term policy measures.”
In 2017, the Council of Ministers issued a Programme for the implementation of a part of the state-owned capital to fill the social security funds, requiring the choice of some central enterprises and some provinces to conduct a pilot project.
According to Liu Qing, the preliminary planning work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, three groups of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transformation work, transforming the total state-owned capital of approximately 860,1 billion yuan.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the central financial institutions that perform the duties of investors have been fundamentally completed.
Central enterprises have a certain scale.
On the local level, the business planned the preliminary work successively.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work of Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces was essentially completed, respectively transferring state-owned capital of 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces also successively conducted preliminary preparation work, setting the basis for the next step of implementation of the preliminary.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State Capital Committee, the General Office of Tax and the Securities Supervisory Board today jointly printed notification, the central and local settlement of part of state-owned capital to fill the social security fund work was fully launched in 2019, and was basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on that day made a specific implementation of the full launch of the transition work.
The meeting emphasized the need to complete the processing work in a practical and efficient manner.
“In accordance with the progress arrangement, the planning work is essentially completed by the end of 2020.
The work time is hard, the task is heavy.”
Liu Qing said that the regions and departments should be carefully organized and closely arranged, ensure that the work is completed according to the request; solidly advance the work, accurately understand the content of the policy; strengthen communication and coordination, and timely solve the difficult problems.
The state’s funding to implement the Social Insurance Fund—from the starting point of “fill the Social Insurance Fund’s cash pocket”, the destination is to provide strong support for the pension insurance.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple “physical transfer” of stock, but the opening of “Mathematical Additional”.
On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of People's Society, the State Capital Committee, the General Bureau of Tax and the Securities Supervisory Board jointly issued "Announcement on the comprehensive launch of the transition of some state-owned capital to fill the work of the Social Insurance Fund" and clarified the state-owned transition of the Social Insurance Fund timetable, that is, the central and local transition of some state-owned capital to fill the work of the Social Insurance Fund in 2019.
After the publication of the document, the Ministry of Finance and other departments were implemented very quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred the 10% of the shares held by the business and agricultural banks to the Social Security Fund, the two shares transferred the total value of more than 115 billion yuan.
In accordance with the provisions, social security funds and others take the subject as financial investors, enjoying the right of revenue, the right of disposal and the right of knowledge of the state-owned stock.
The industrial and agricultural banks said in the announcement that this change of interests will not lead to changes in the bank’s control shareholders and the actual controlers.
In this regard, the author believes that similar state-owned equity distribution is not a simple change in the equity attribution, but that it can stimulate a series of effects of “add-on operations”.
The first step in some countries’ financing of the social security transfer is the “additional result”, which can naturally reflect the state-owned enterprise’s ownership of all the people, and the development of the results of all the people’s sharing.
After many years of reform and development, state enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in our economy, the overall profitability is stronger and more stable.
Of these, the leading companies are more continuously achieving to do good and strong.
On 10 July, the State Council’s permanent meeting decided that this year it will complete the implementation of a part of the state-owned capital to fill the work of the Social Security Fund.
The Ministry of Finance said that it will, with the relevant departments, in accordance with the implementation of the State Council's permanent meeting, prepare for a comprehensive launch of the work of the transfer of part of the state-owned capital to fill the social insurance funds, to fully reflect generational fairness and public sharing of the results of the development of the state-owned enterprises.
The second step of the transformation is to increase the sustainability of our Social Security Fund and further strengthen the basis of the social security system.
With the ageing of the population, China’s social security funds are under pressure, and this time the state capital, most of which has a sustainable profitability and dividend capacity, can not only effectively complement the social security funds, but also provide the social security funds with a source of living water.
Estimates show that every 3.8 percent transfer of state-owned capital can support a 1 percent reduction in the payment ratio of corporate basic pension insurance.
The third step of the shift is to increase the stabilizer for the capital markets.
The way the subjects of this transfer to obtain profits is "sharing as main, transport as complementary".
Social security funds, as financial investors of state-owned capital, are actually dominated by obtaining dividend revenues.
However, social security funds, as capital market value investors, have a stronger capital operation capacity.
For the listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in holding shares will further optimize the legal and legal governance structure of the listed enterprises, favor the level of business of the enterprises and have a positive impact on the listed enterprises and the capital markets.
At the same time, the Social Security Fund, as an investment wind target, increases the share weight, contributes to further enhancing its influence in the market and plays the role of a “stabilizer” in the market.
In addition, it is also beneficial to fully deploy the "value discovery" function of institutional investors, leading investors to reasonable investments and value investments.

Iran has been confirmed to develop advanced detoxifier to further suspend the implementation of the Iranian nuclear deal
The International Atomic Energy Agency of the United Nations (IAEA) said on 26 September that Iran has used advanced separator to manufacture accumulated iron, and has once again violated the Iranian nuclear agreement.

China’s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
White Paper: China’s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The White Paper points out that China’s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The White Paper says that as China’s comprehensive national power and international influence are rapidly increasing, some people on the international level are concerned that China will go the path of “National Strength Holding” and some submit the so-called “China Threat Theory”.
This has both cognitive misleading, profound prejudice, and the psychological imbalance brought by strength and strength, as well as the intentional distortion of the preservation of the self-sufficient interest.
To the richness of the country, national revival, and people’s happiness, is both the dream of the Chinese people and the common dream of the people of all countries.
“China’s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.”
The White Paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, China is the greatest contributor to world economic growth, China's technology and innovation injects new power for world economic growth, and the future stabilizer and power source role of China's economy is more prominent.
The current global economic growth is not sufficient, and a stable Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world.
China’s economy is moving from fast growth to high-quality development, new industrialization, informationization, urbanization, agricultural modernization accelerate progress, deep economic structure adjustment, industrial optimization continues to upgrade, new economic growth points continues to appear.
“The McKinsey Global Institute’s research report suggests that by 2040, China and other world economies will be integrated to create $22 trillion to $37 trillion of economic value, equivalent to 15% to 26% of the total global economy, and the world’s other economies and China will strengthen cooperation will create enormous economic value.”
The White Paper emphasizes that the Chinese economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and deep integration.
China’s economic operation is more stable, its growth quality is higher and its growth prospects are long-term favourable to the world’s economic development.
Considering China’s economic development as “threats” and “threats”, attempting to pull China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain, and value chain, making China “disconnected” with the world economy, both impossible and harmful.
The White Paper points out that the full-range opening to the outside creates more opportunities for countries to share "China interest".
China is firmly pursuing an open strategy of mutual benefit and win, achieving a greater strength and a higher level of openness to the outside, China has the world’s most potential consumer market, China is the most attractive investment destination, more large scale “go out” benefit more countries.
“Openness should be two-way, mutually beneficial, not one-way, one-sided.
The mutual benefit can last long.”
According to the White Paper, China is committed to continuing to expand imports, facilitating market access, improving the business environment, strengthening the protection of intellectual property, and other countries should also expand the opening, take appropriate measures and strive to improve their business environment.
Only the parties can move towards each other and create an open, inclusive, universal, balanced and win-win development environment, jointly make the “cake” of development bigger and greater, and form a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interest.
The White Paper notes that China provides more public products to the international community.
It includes promoting a high-quality “Belt and Road” co-building, building a multilateral dialogue and cooperation platform, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively operating foreign assistance.
“China is developing thanks to the international community, and it is not always forgotten to return to the international family, to provide the international community with more better public products.”

Demonstrations on the President's resignation of Egypt's mountains want authorities to demonstrate strong repression
Twitter theme labels and social media are strongly encouraging the Egyptian people to go on the streets today to peacefully demand the resignation of President Sessy.
But the authorities have shown their intention to use force to repress.
Since then the military leader Sessy took power in the 2013 military coup, the expression of opposition has been almost hidden in Egypt, and any form of protest is more likely to be in extreme danger.
The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a non-governmental organization in Cairo, said more than 1,900 people have been arrested since the rare protests on Cessy's resignation last weekend.
Through Cessy and his family, the public has been pursuing corruption accusations, leading thousands of people to demonstrate on the streets on the 20th day.
The Egyptian Ministry of Internal Affairs said on Thursday that any attempt to destroy the stability of the country will be resolutely and never soft.
The city centre of Cairo has long been wary, and on the streets around the 2011 Egyptian revolutionary explosion, the Tahrir Square, there are massacres of police, security agencies, vehicles and clothes of police.
The Peninsula TV reports that the security forces detained several important scientists and social scientists, including a professor of political science at the University of Cairo and a famous column writer, Nafa.
He tweeted: “Continue giving Sessy the absolute rule will cause a catastrophe, I have no doubt.
“He immediately resigned in accordance with the interests of Egypt.”
Hossney, a spokesman for former Chief General of the Armed Forces of Egypt, Annan, was detained before the arrest of Nafa.
Annan was arrested after attempting to compete with Sessy for the presidency last year.
The President of the Constituent Party, Da Wade, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that in the moment of the worsening economic difficulties of the poor and the middle class, the discouraging behavior of opponents reflects the government’s instability and vulnerability.
The opposition leader, Ayman Nour, who had once taken over the presidency, said: “The arrest operation highlights how the regime ignores the Egyptian people, and how it itself fears.”
“Because the economy has been disrupted by him, along with the general implementation of political oppression, Sessy tries to communicate a clear message to the important generals and political figures that may be replaced.”
Noor pointed out that, under the condition that the socio-economic situation continues to deteriorate, the government’s high-pressure methods will only increase people’s anger.
Since the fear barrier has been broken, he expected more people to go on the streets.
The currently expelled Spanish businessman and actress, Ali, who was an Egyptian military construction contractor, began to upload a series of films early in the month, claiming to benefit from government corruption, triggering a small-scale protests in different cities last weekend.
Ali said that his company Amrak General contracts would not have to go through a legal tender process and could get profitable contracts, emphasizing the army and Cessy's relatives, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi, in corruption.
He was deeply regretted for his participation in it.
Ali claims that his assistance to the Fury Palace and the luxury hotels in Sessigae is clearly compared to the actual Egyptian poor life, and the other side has not paid.
Themes such as “stay out and you’re not alone”, “Sessy you’re gone”, “Sessy you’re going” and “Next Friday” have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and tweets, calling people to go on the streets in a peaceful way and asking Sessy to resign.
The Hollywood Egyptian man star Amavik has seven million followers on Twitter.
He tweeted yesterday in Arabic: “Cessy is destroyed... he’s over, and those who support him are now making a big mistake.”

Make Chinese citizens “go out” more secure — Visit Ministry of Foreign Affairs Consular Division Director Tree Ayman
Wherever you go, your country is behind you.
On 25th, the first consulate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protect the public interest short film was on the line, and the sentence ended by the short film caused a lot of internet users to resonate.
The Director of the Consular Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tree Ayman, said in an interview with the news agency Xinhua News that the short film aims to further enable people to feel the feelings and temperatures of "diplomacy as a people" and to enable Chinese citizens to feel, no matter where they are in any corner of the world, Chinese diplomats will stretch their hands and give them help, strength and hope.
Foreign security is not a small thing, a piece of a whole concern.
In the past 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens “go out” has grown drastically, from the “mediate annual less than a million” before the reform and the opening to more than a million times a year today; at the same time, the security of Chinese citizens travel abroad is more guaranteed, consular protection work and assistance work objects are also expanded from foreign Chinese citizens to Chinese citizens, tourists, foreign students, business workers and other groups.
According to statistics, since the 18th Congress of the Party, we have organized more than 10 major operations for the evacuation or transfer of Chinese citizens abroad, bringing more than 40,000 Chinese citizens safely out of dangerous and turmoil areas.
Approximately 500,000 cases of acceptance and coordination of all kinds of aid requests involve one million Chinese citizens.
At dangerous moments, the motherland can take you home; wanting to come to a “going and walking journey” is no longer a dream.
By the end of this year, China has signed a visa-free agreement with 14 countries covering ordinary passports.
More and more countries unilaterally give Chinese citizens entry facilities such as visa-free or landing visas.
42 countries and regions, including Thailand and Egypt, unilaterally granted landing visas to Chinese citizens with ordinary passports, while 15 countries and regions, including Indonesia, unilaterally allowed visa-free entry to Chinese citizens with ordinary passports.
In addition to visa-free arrangements, landing visas and other arrangements, Chinese citizens are also increasingly convenient to apply for visas and the procedures are increasingly simplified.
By the end of August, China has reached agreements or arrangements to simplify visa procedures with 41 countries.
These include achieving mutual tourism with the United States, Canada, Israel, Argentina, issuing 10 years valid multi-vises for business personnel, and with the UK achieving 2 years multi-vises arrangements for mutual tourism, business, visitors, etc.
The UK and Belgium jointly launched the “Visa One Station” service, with France, Italy and Singapore shortening the visa receipt time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
For business people who are frequently abroad, multiple entry and easy-to-country APEC business travel cards are not a good choice.
According to Tree, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining a five-year multiple visa for 16 economies around Asia-Pacific, which is significant for business workers, especially private entrepreneurs, to "go out".
Currently, China is ranked first in the APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate the bilateral visa reciprocity agreement, encourage more countries to take visa facilitation measures to Chinese citizens, make the outcomes of diplomatic work more transformed into favourable citizens' facilitation initiatives, and continuously increase the 'contingent amount' of Chinese passports.

“One-time” two large high-pressure operations.
On the 26th of May, the Pre-Eastern to Chongqing ± 1100 kWh high-pressure straight-stream power transmission engineering, the Southeast 1000 kWh high-pressure GIL integrated pipeline engineering launched.
Both of these projects occupy the highest levels of current world power transfer technology in their respective fields, and after delivery will make China’s energy range optimization and configuration can be significantly improved.
Guo Chi, the general economist of the National Energy Bureau, said that the Chongqing to Chongqing project is the world’s largest power transmission capacity and the most distant power transmission project.
Its transportation is important to promote the development of the Xinjiang energy base and to ensure the supply of electricity in the Washington region.
GIL, that is, gas isolated metal closed transmission lines.
Southeast Pipeline Engineering, created the GIL Engineering record of the world’s highest voltage level, the strongest transmission capacity, achieved the highest voltage level of the “communication double ring network” joint operation.
According to the National Electric Network Company, the distance between the East and Chongqing Engineering is 3324 km.
If the conventional technology is used, more than 15 percent of electricity will be lost on the road, and the project will be developed and developed by the Customs, which will significantly increase the economic transport distance to more than 3,000 kilometers.
After the launch of the project, 100 million degrees of electricity can be transmitted every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help break down the problem of the extinction of the existing new energy in Xinjiang.
According to full load estimates, the single line of electricity will reach 600 to 85 billion kWh per year, which can meet more than half of Shanghai's electricity consumption throughout the year.
SuTun GIL Comprehensive Pipeline Engineering is a controlling project across Longjiang High Pressure Communications Circuit Network.
If you use the conventional square lines to cross the river, it is necessary to build two giant rail towers over 450 meters on the river of Longjiang, and to build an artificial island of the size of over four football fields for each rail tower.
In this regard, the national power network has boldly innovated, developed a compact high-pressure GIL transmission technology, through the tunnel from the underwater river, avoided the impact on the golden trail.
The two projects to drive our electrical equipment manufacturing capacity have achieved a new jump.
Currently, the national electricity network has built “10 to 11 straight” special high-pressure project, and “4 to 3 straight” is in construction.
Foreign Exchange Bureau: Foreign debt structure continuously optimizes Foreign debt stability increases
“In general, our foreign debt structure continues to be optimized and the stability of foreign debt increases.”
A spokesman for the National Foreign Exchange Administration and the general economist, Wang Chung Ing, said on Thursday that the main indicators of foreign debt in China are within the international recognized security line, and the risk of foreign debt in general can be controlled.
In the same day, the Foreign Exchange Bureau published the foreign debt data at the end of June 2019, and responded to the questions of the journalists.
Data show that by the end of June 2019, China's total debt balance (including foreign currency) was $1998 billion, a $26.3 billion increase compared to the end of March 2019, a 1.3 percent increase, mainly due to the debt balance growth.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70 percent of China’s total foreign debt growth was driven by non-residents purchasing Yuan bonds in the territory, and among non-residents mainly by medium-term investors such as the central bank.
At the end of June 2019, the average long-term foreign debt compared to the end of March 2019 increased by 3 percentage points, and the foreign debt compared to the end of March 2019 increased by 1 percentage point.
As Yuan bonds in China were included in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Comprehensive Index in April 2019, the recognition of international investors for the Chinese bond market increased further and continued to increase the holding of Yuan bonds in China.
“Our international payments maintain the overall balance and the risk of foreign debt is controllable.”
The journalist learned from the Yunnan Province Agricultural Sciences Academy that today Yunnan grass and grass have been effectively controlled, not caused large areas of explosion to catastrophe, and the prevention work has achieved step-by-step results.
In January of this year, the Jiangxi County of Yunnan, Yunnan, found for the first time the grass crude that migrated from abroad, then in Yunnan 129 districts confirmed the occurrence, the grass crude also spread from Yunnan gradually to China's interior territory, which constitutes a direct threat to China's food production.
The grass is an important farming insect that is multi-food and remote migratory originating in the American tropical and sub-tropical regions and is a major migratory insect of the UN FAO’s global warning, with the characteristics of “international, migratory, explosive, devastating”.
The insect damages more than 80 species of crops, such as corn, magnesium, coca-cola, and is consumed in large quantities, which can lead to a production loss of up to 70%.
Prevention is very difficult, there is no registration of pesticides in China to prevent the insect.
Since the flooding of grass and grass in Yunnan, the Yunnan Province Agricultural Science Academy has chosen the Yunnan Province Agricultural Science Academy researchers to lead the agriculture cross-border harmful biological co-operation and the Green Control Province Innovation Team, to run to the first line, field investigation, sampling samples, and conduct technical guidance and experimental demonstration.
The Yunnan Eidong team has initially mastered the group characteristics of Yunnan grass, natural enemy insect resources, external insect sources characteristics, group migration trails, drug toxicity and field prevention effects.
They actively conduct research and application of green control technology, through the implementation of new green control technologies such as group surveillance, insect detection, scientific drug use and agricultural measures, the anti-controlling effect in the demonstration area has reached more than 90%, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting natural enemy resources and the ecological environment, and providing technical guarantees for Yunnan to effectively control the disasters and sustainable governance of grass and grass.
Currently, Yunnan grass and grass have received effective prevention control, did not cause large areas of explosion to catastrophe, and the prevention work has achieved gradual results.
The next step, the Yunnan Province Agricultural Science Academy will focus on the implementation of the ecological mechanisms of mass migration into the invasion, breaking over the construction of the bio-controlling and green-controlling technology system.
At the same time, actively promoting cross-border international cooperation, struggling to establish joint key laboratories and joint monitoring networks and demonstration zones abroad, in order to enhance the monitoring and pre-warning capacity of the entire range of Yunnan grass and grass.

Requirements: Social capital to obtain the right to operate rural land
Social capital to obtain the right to operate rural land needs to be qualified
The "Rural Land Operating Rights Flow Management Measures" openly asks for opinion Planning to regulate the social capital flows, such as industrial and commercial enterprises, to obtain land operating rights
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs published a notice of public request for opinion on the “Rural Land Operating Rights Flow Management Measures (Modification Proposal for Request of Opinion)” (hereinafter referred to as “The Opinion Proposal”) and increased the regulation and risk prevention of social capital flows, such as industrial and commercial enterprises, to obtain land operating rights.
The opinion proposal is now openly asked for opinion from the society.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said, in order to implement the new amendments to the Rural Land Contracts Act, to further consolidate and improve the basic rural operating system, to deepen the reform of the rural land system, to implement the "three-power distribution" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs made amendments to the "Rural Land Contracts and Land Contracts Operating Rights Transfer Management Measures" and formed the Opinion Report.
The journalist of the Beijing Youth Journal learned that there were many important amendments to the first publication of the Opinion Report.
The newly amended Rural Land Contracts Act clarifies the scope of the land flow, implementes the concept of “three-power distribution”, specifically establishes the “land contract operating right” and “land operating right” respectively, making a clear distinction between the transfer of the land contract operating right, interchange and the transfer of the land operating right (leasing, transfer, deposit or other means).
In this Opinion, in order to implement the concept of "three-power distribution", to effectively respond to the amendment of the Law on Rural Land Contracts, and considering that there are large differences in the fields of land-operating rights flows and land-contracts operating rights exchanges, transfers in the parties, procedures, regulations, etc., this amendment has been defined for the scope of flows, focused on the land-operating rights flows, flow methods including lease, insert, etc., the name of the regulations will be modified by the "Rural Land Contracts operating rights flows management method" to the "Rural Land-operating rights flows management method".
The transfer and exchange of land contracting operating rights shall be established by the other means of management.
The Opinion notes that in the context of “three-power distribution”, farmers share only a periodic land-operating right.
Theoretically, even if there is a bankruptcy settlement, the farmer is only at risk of losing the business rights for a certain period of time, therefore the provision of contractual return to the original contractor is no longer legal and there is a conflict with the Bankruptcy Act.
With the aim of preventing the risks of land losses by farmers, priority shares, first-lease after-shares, recovery and other methods have been developed in practice.
Given that priority shares have a more mature theory on corporate law, it is recommended to use it as a protective provision to prevent the risk of loss of shares.
