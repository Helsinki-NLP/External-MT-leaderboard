A thousand farmers march in High Court against Gujarat's dream project of development
The petition has been filed in the High Court against the acquisition of land from farmers of Gujarat for the Central Government's Dream Project Bullet Train.
During the hearing of the petition, 1000 farmers had taken affidavit stating that the State Government has no right to acquire their land.
The bench of the Chief Justice had given an ultimatum to the Central Government that if the Central Government does not submit a reply on the land acquisition by 26th, the court will issue a final order.
The High Court has also lashed out at the Central Government for ignoring the orders of the High Court and the Supreme Court.
Further hearing will be held on 26th September.
The High Court had taken the State Government to task for objecting to the affidavits of a thousand farmers from a total of eight districts of Gujarat in the interstate bullet train project.
You are misleading the court.
In your presentation, you said that only 4-7 farmers had objections, but a large number of farmers have taken oaths.
Advocate Anand Yajniak on behalf of the farmers argued that the Central Government has not provided a firm response for the country's most expensive project of Rs.1 lakh crore, which is linked to more than one state, even though it has been more than three months.
The Centre is trying to prevent the case from going forward in the High Court by not providing an answer.
As there is no strong defence against land acquisition by the central or state government, farmers are being threatened by the collector as a last resort.
Blackmail is being used to seize land as it is new condition land.
The threat of confiscation is being made if the land is not acquired.
The Central Government has not submitted a reply to the High Court despite the Supreme Court's order on August 10.
As a result, the farmers will again go to the Supreme Court tomorrow to demand that their order be enforced.
More than 3000 farmers from 8 districts of Gujarat will go to Japan to save their land and report all the facts to the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) about the injustice done to them by the Central Government.
The agreement with the Central Government also provides for cancellation of the agreement if injustice is done to the farmers.
The farmers will inform Geeka that a loan of Rs. 1000 crore has been taken for the bullet train following the agreement with Geeka Company of Japan.
But Japan has not yet given more than Rs 300 crore.

Internationally, China seeks to make the yuan an international currency on a par with the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
In view of the potential for economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making this deal in rupees and rubles.
Amidst the US sanctions, India and Russia today agreed on the S-400 missile defense system.
The agreement will be signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
In the run up to the approval of the S-400 deal, the two countries are in the process of working out a way to use the US dollar to pay for the deal.
Sources claim that India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making the deal in rupees and rubles in view of the potential for economic sanctions from the US.
The US imposed a ban on China during the deal
It is to be noted that in September, Russia signed an S-400 missile deal with China.
After the deal, US President Donald Trump decided to impose sanctions on China.
The ban made it almost impossible for China to buy missiles using US dollars.
However, over the past few years, China has been trying to establish its currency, the yuan, as an international currency against the dollar.
Since this initiative, China has been trying to make the yuan an international currency equivalent to the dollar, euro, yen and pound.
On the other hand, China has the largest US dollar reserve in international trade.
China wants to make the yuan an international currency
The US could impose a ban on the $5 billion mega defence deal, Countering American Adversaries Through Sections (CAATSA).
Last month, the US imposed a ban on China buying S-400 missile systems.
India and Russia have since started setting up alternative arrangements for the deal.
Earlier, the US sanctions on the repair deal of INS Chakra, leased from Russia, had put a dent in an estimated $2 billion deal between India and Russia.
Economic analysts claim that to get out of this situation, India should exercise a deal using the rupee-ruble exchange as the international currency.
It is worth mentioning that all defence deals India has made with Russia so far have been done in the dollar.
Why Waste Law in the United States?
President Donald Trump approved the Katsa Act in August, which targets Russia's advanced defense missile system. - The US has drafted the law to prevent Russia from acting against US interests internationally.
The US law was drafted in view of Russia's activities.
These include Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, its involvement in the Syrian civil war, and its interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
Then suddenly a thousand-year-old secret came to light.
This is the story of a man from Turkey who made a big discovery while repairing his house.
While repairing, he collided with a secret door when the wall of his basement broke.
From here he reached an underground tunnel, where he encountered a city thousands of years old hidden underground.
The images of the city show how about 20,000 people lived in this underground city with all their belongings and food and drink.
600 gates to enter the city:
The event dates back to 1963, when a Turkish man living in Cappadocia discovered an underground city.
A wall in her basement broke down while repairing the house.
From here, an underground city called Darinuku was found, located 280 feet underground.
Its depth was equal to an 18-story building.
This underground city was once home to 20,000 people, with everything from rooms, couches, schools, churches, tombs, etc. to ventilation.
There are 600 gates to enter and exit the city.
There are heavy gates to prevent intruders from entering the underground city.
Each of its floors can be closed separately.
It is believed that the city was built between 780 and 1180 AD during the Byzantine era to protect the people from the Arab-Byzantine wars and natural disasters.
Became a tourist attraction:
Derinkuyu is not the only underground city in the world.
There are many other cities like this, but this is the largest underground city.
Although only half of the city is accessible, it has become a popular tourist attraction in Cappadocia.
People come here to see it because of its historical and cultural significance.

The postmortem report of the birds revealed the truth
The incident of birds falling unconscious and hitting windows in Minnesota, USA has sparked many rumors.
Some people said that the birds were victims of blade magic, but they started to associate it with this unusual phenomenon.
When the incidents started to increase in many places in Minnesota, the police started investigating and brought out the mystery behind the incident.
The birds became addicted.
The police were getting many complaints of strange behavior of birds and falling on the road.
Disturbed by the constant incoming calls, Gilbert Police in Minnesota began investigating the case.
Gilbert Police collected the birds, which had been smashed against stacked windows and vehicles, and performed a post-mortem, which yielded a shocking discovery.

A bird was getting drunk from a tree
The police solved the mystery with the help of experts.
It is said that most of the birds were getting drunk by eating a type of berry.

Drunk birds were becoming delusional, causing them to crash.
How to Avoid Being Told by the Police

In such a situation, people have been told how to save themselves.
A window with high reflectivity and a windscreen could prevent it from hitting, police said.
Police have told people through Facebook not to pay attention to any kind of rumors as there is no black magic.

Whether or not prayers in mosques are an integral part of Islam, Supreme Court to decide today
The High Court is likely to rule on petitions of Muslim groups seeking a review by a Grand Bench of the 1994 Supreme Court decision on the Ram Janmabhoomi - Babri Masjid ownership dispute today.
The High Court had said that prayers in mosques are not an integral part of Islam.
According to the news agency, Chief Justice Dipak Mishra and Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice S Abdul Nazir will pronounce their verdict on the back of the bench.
The bench had secured it on 20 July.
A fundamentalist in the Ayodhya case, M. Siddique, had challenged this particular conclusion in the 1994 decision in the case of M. Israel Farooqi.
The mosque was not an integral part of the prayers performed by followers of Islam.
Siddique is deceased and is represented by his legal heir.
The Muslim groups have argued before the bench presided over by the Chief Justice that the decision requires a review by a five-member bench on the High Court's observations.
This will affect the issue of mosque, Ram temple, land dispute.
Senior Advocate Rajiv Dhawan, speaking on behalf of Siddique's legal representative, said that the mosque is not an integral part of Islam.
The High Court made this comment without any kind of examination or consideration of religious books.
The Uttar Pradesh government had told the apex court that some Muslim community is trying to delay the long pending Ayodhya temple-mosque land dispute by seeking reconsideration of the comment that the mosque is not an integral part of Islam.
Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, speaking on behalf of the UP Government, said that the dispute had been awaiting final resolution for almost a century.

In the first meeting, Sachin had made a prophecy about Prithvi Shah.
Sports Desk: Prithvi Shah has made a name for himself by scoring centuries in his Test match debut.
Prithvi Shah is being compared to Sachin Tendulkar.
Just like the way Prithvi has played a big big innings at school level, Sachin has also been in the innings.
Sachin Tendulkar tweeted his congratulations on the centenary of Prithvi Shah.
In the first interview, Sachin had taken the prediction of the earth shadow.
Sachin Tendulkar was also seen happy with the start of the series.
Sachin also praised the earth.
Sachin recalled the day when he first saw Prithvi Shah batting and said something about him.
Sachin shared the experience: About 10 years ago, his friend Jagdish Chauhan once asked me to watch Prithvi Shahi bat.
'This young player wants to meet you and it would be good if you could meet him,' said Chauhan.
Sachin believed his friend and went to see his batting.
'He still remembers telling his friend that this child will play for India one day,' Sachin said.
Then Sachin 's friend said, 'Are you telling the truth?
Sachin said, "Remember my word, this child will play for India.
Sachin spoke about the greatest joy of Prithvi Shah
Praising Prithvi Shah, Sachin said, "What I have seen, he learns quickly.
It is different to have talent in a player but what you do with that talent is more important.
If you want to succeed in international cricket, you need to have the ability to learn early.
Adaptability is essential to play for long periods in different terrains and conditions.
I think that Prithvi Shah has the ability to play the game in different situations and this is the greatest strength of the planet.
Sachin said that the hand and eye coordination of Prithvi Shah is remarkable.
The way he catches the ball line and the length, it is seen in very few players.
This is a natural gift of the Earth, which is not present in many athletes.

How could the court language of the Sultan of Ghazni, Mahmud Ghazni, the vandal of Somnath temple and a villain to the common Indian, be Sanskrit?
In fact, research by Shantha Pandey, a professor of history at Delhi University, has shown that the official language of Ghazni was Sanskrit.
When the Shri Somnath Trust recently honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for their service to Sanskrit, it was natural to ask whether Sanskrit was only a folk language or the language of so-called noble Brahmins.
Pandit Ghulam Dasgir Biragdar of Mumbai was remembered.
The 87-year-old Pandit Biradjardar, who speaks simple Sanskrit that even the rickshaw-women can understand, is still finalising the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Quran before its release.
The word holy Quran is Sanskrit in their eyes.
Ku + ran means the voice or message of the messenger heard on earth.
He not only attended the school in Solapur himself, but he is one of the greatest Sanskrit scholars in the country.
However, Panditji, who lives a simple life, does not seek to go to America or other countries to give lectures as a Sanskrit scholar to market himself.
The Princess of Thailand is a Sanskrit scholar.
There, Sanskrit is taught to the utmost.
To learn Sanskrit from the US, Tsuko has to go to the University of Bonn, Germany.
In India, most universities except Banaras Hindu University also have PhD theses in Sanskrit written in the language of the state.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught in Gujarati, but it should be remembered that in Takshashila and Nalanda universities, education was taught in Sanskrit.
The prevalence of Sanskrit in Afghanistan Shantya Pandey has said that not only was the court language of the Ghazni Sultan Sanskrit, but he also noted that he had his coins engraved in Sanskrit.
The coins are also said to have the inscription "Mahmud Surathan" imported from the Quran in Sanskrit and Panini, the author of the grammar of Sanskrit, was a resident of Shalapur, Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru, in a large chapter on the power and sustainability of Sanskrit in his Philosophy of My India, said that the Pashto language of Afghan and Patanos was derived from Sanskrit.
Today, it is accepted that not only Indian languages but also Indo-European languages have their roots in Sanskrit.
Another surprise for the supporters of Dr. Ambedkar's national language is that the chief architect of the Constitution, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and several other Muslim and South Indian members of the Constituent Assembly proposed to make Sanskrit the national language of the country.
When the question of the national language was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on 13 September 1949 between Hindi vs. English, Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. B. V. Keskar and Nazruddin Ahmed were among those who proposed Sanskrit as the national language.
The debate of that day and the report published in the National Herald of September 11, 1949, suggest that Sanskrit is in decline.
Unfortunately, even today we have not been able to decide on a national language.
22 Indian languages including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu have an official status in our Constitution, but not as a national language.
According to the 2011 census, Sanskrit is now the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country.
The Hon'ble Prime Minister of Sanskrit, Nehru, spoke about Sanskrit with great respect in the Constituent Assembly.
In the relevant chapter of his book, he turns to Sanskrit and details the importance of Sanskrit to scholars around the world: "In 1874, Sir William Jones said, 'The Sanskrit language is ancient, but its design is wonderful.
It is more complete than Greek, more abundant than Latin, and more noble than both.
Nehru further notes: "I do not know how long Sanskrit has been dead, i.e. when it has become a popular language".
Today, Sanskrit is the language of prayer or the language of oaths taken by members like Union Minister Smriti Irani as an MP.
We need to preserve the heritage of Sanskrit and make it a living and popular language.
If the dead language of Israel can revive Hebrew, Sanskrit is still a living language.
It is only worthwhile to make a serious effort to make it a folk language rather than a show or symbolic effort.
After the welcome at the airport, to whom did Narendra Modi point and ask to come with him?
