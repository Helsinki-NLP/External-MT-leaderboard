The rapidly increasing cumulative incidents of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidents of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) showed similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK which confirmed that, although its levels vary depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic develops very rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italian experience, the country, hospitals, and intensive care units should improve their preparation for the rise of COVID-19 patients who will require health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown etiology was in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention the disease's cousative agent is a new coronavirus now called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to this moment shows that about 80% of COVID-19 patients have a mild disease, i.e. respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients healed.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops to a more severe disease and requires hospital care, while 6% of other cases experience critical disease that requires intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients treated in the hospital due to COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this study, we looked at the cumulative COVID-19 incidents trends in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the UK (UK) and then compared it to the incidents in the Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and the UK with the number of cases in Italy between 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in the EU/EEA and the UK
After China, COVID-19 experienced further geographical spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world now follow the dynamics of the pandemic in China.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) General Director declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020 released March 5, Spiteri et al. the first Europeans with COVID-19 case confirmed based on the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA and UK countries, between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 with those dates including, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents of the COVID-19 case
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases by each country around the world is updated daily at 8:00 p.m. This number is only obtained from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the country, national and regional health authorities, and the WHO.
These data were used to evaluate the COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as to compare it with the trends in Italy.
As a proxy of the prevalence of COVID-19 cases active, we count the cumulative incidents lasted 14 days, so consider COVID-19 natural travel in each EU/EEA and UK, in the period 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases notified by each country until 15 March 2020 at 8.00 compared to Italian cases during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 train in the EU/EEA and the UK
The cumulative incident trend lasted 14 days in the COVID-19 case in the EU/EEA and the UK generally followed the trend in the Hubei Province (China) (Photo 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidents of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February, then sharply rise around 28 February 2020 (Additional Materials).
This trend was mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar cumulative COVID-19 incidents increase trend (additives).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data pointed out that, until March 15 at 8:00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have the total number of cases compared to the total number of cases Italy three weeks earlier or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend observed at the cumulative COVID-19 incident indicates that pandemics rise at the same rate in all countries.
This depends on the differences in levels experienced by the countries, the variations in public health responses, and the possible differences in case definition between the countries and the differences in protocols to choose the patient to be tested for the confirmation of COVID-19, which includes subsequent testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian province explained that about 10% of COVID-19 patients need intensive care and media sources that hospitals and intensive care units in the region have reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 case receipt data in hospitals and/or intensive care units at the EU/EAA level are only available for 6% and 1% of cases (data is not shown).
However, the data should be collected in a systematic way to complete the current surveillance data that focuses on the number of cases and the number of deaths.
Studies conducted in 2010-2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of intensive care beds and medical care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries could have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 intensive care beds and medical care per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010-2011).
The modeling scenario relating to the density of health care capacity, with estimates of the prevalence of cases of COVID-19 residential treatment for each EU/EEA country and the UK related to the risk of >90% exceeding the intensive care bed capacity, provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Fast Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
Since so far cases are classified in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population coverage of specific regional services, information about cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the Level of Regional Unit Nomination for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic develops very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, the country, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of COVID-19 patients that need health care, especially intensive care, as happens in the affected regions of Italy.
As shown in the recent ECDC Fast Risk Assessment, a quick, proactive, and comprehensive approach is essential to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with the transition from the blocking approach to the mitigation approach, because the rapid increase in the number of cases, as expected, may not give enough time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, receive, and adapt the correct response if it has not been applied before.
The rapid risk assessment also includes public health measures to mitigate the effects of pandemic.
The short opportunity window is available as the country has the possibility to further increase its operating efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, other EU/EEA national health care systems will likely face a rise in patients who need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing disasters for humans.
Similar to the homologue virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from the drug and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower rate of severity and mortality than SARS, but more infectious and more about lansia than young people, as well as more in men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications about this newly emerging disease, this article tries to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing subject of research.
We will discuss the principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although there are still many unanswered questions, we hope this survey will help understand and accelerate this threatening disease.
The Summer Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were ordered to stay at home for holidays and a few weeks later due to a new viral disease epidemic.
The virus is very homologated with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it caused was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread throughout the state and to 50 other countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 COVID-19 cases confirmed, with more than 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the “No. 1 audience enemy” and is potentially more destructive than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), within less than two months from the first report on January 7, 2020 that determined the sequence of the virus isolated from several patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This survey aims to summarize the research progress in this rapidly developing new subject.
As possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, namely the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, epidemic in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis as well as some other unanswered, but urgent questions.
According to tradition, CoV is considered a nonethal pathogen for humans, mainly causing about 15% of the cold.
Nevertheless, in this century, we have found very pathogenic CoVs for humans twice, namely SARS-CoVs and MERS-CoVs, each causing an initial epidemic in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and immediately spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is the third CoV epidemic in human history recorded.
As shown in Gbr.1.1, unknown source pneumonia cluster was first from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan was.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spreads rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, a healthcare provider’s infection was, signaling that transmission from human to human may occur.
On 23 January, the provincial quarantine was implemented in the city of Wuhan and all public transportation was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease that, from 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients contacted the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the early location of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
At the time the report was written, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world (Gbr.
Because the situation is developing very quickly, the end coverage and severity of the epidemic must still be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-center study of 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 COVID-19 patients confirmed, presented the following more updated epidemic picture (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people in all ages, but especially in the ages of 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of people infected are over 50 years old, only a few are under 20 years old, and only 14 people infected are under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0,31/100,000) than women (0,27/100,000).
COVID-19 is widespread in the clusters, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average time of 5 (2-9) days from awakening to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time starting from awakening to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4,05) and the customized R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, according to massive transportation times before the Summer Festival in China.
Patient mortality with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1,86%) and custom mortality for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2,02-4,59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (pria), age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of a massive mixed virus that contains a single unit of RNA sense.
CoV can be divided into four genes, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein or spike (S) cover connected with its cell receptors, angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) and peptidase 4 (DPP4) enzymes respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The genome of the virus's RNA is released into the cytoplasma; after the replication of the virus's genome, the genome of the virus's RNA is accompanied by the glucoprotein cover and the nucleocapside protein forms a vesicle containing virions, which subsequently experiences a fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic equality of more than 99.98% among the 10 follow-up samples; the samples were taken from the original location of the epidemic, namely the Huanan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles are found in the very thin epithelial part of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 protein associated with human ACE2 is weaker than its link to SARS-CoV protein, which is in line with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a non-party SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins embedded with orf3b and proteins embedded with orf8.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and IFNβ expression inhibition; however, orf8 does not have a functional domain or a known motivation.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. the complete human cryo-EM ACE2 structure at a resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that the complex, which has an open and closed conformation, is structured to form a dimer and the complex ACE2-B0AT1 can bind two S proteins, which are evidence for the introduction and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target in drug filtration to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to be derived from cellars and each is transmitted to humans through mushrooms and camels.
Through the philogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the mercury is considered as the original inang of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical with two similar-SARS CoVs from the mercury called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediary inhabitants that help the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans are still unknown, and the transmission route is still to be explained.
Ji, et al. suggests the serpent as a carrier of the virus from the serpent to humans that involves homologue recombination in protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that swelling, long-moncong mammals that are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potentially a SARS-CoV-2 intermediate inheritance based on 99% genetic homology of CoV found in swelling and SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the 1% difference spread throughout the genom is still a big difference; therefore, the conclusive result as concrete evidence is not yet obtained (Gbr.
The physical chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is to be sensitive to ultraviolet and hot rays at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant containing chlorine, peracetate acid, chlorform, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, effectively disactivates the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is susceptible to this new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies reporting an immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other previous CoV studies, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr.
In general, after invading the inherent, the virus is recognized by the inherent immune system through the pattern-like receptor (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different trails, viruses induce the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturity, and type I interferon synthesis (IFN) which restricts the spread of the virus and accelerates the fagositosis of the virus antigen by macrophages.
However, protein N in SARS-CoV can help the virus prevent immune response.
Shortly later, an adaptive immune response joined in the fight against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include cells CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies against the virus, and CD8+ T cells kill the virus-infected cells directly.
The T cell assistant produces pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect the cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes supplements, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from healed patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce a large number of free radicals locally, which can lead to severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, failure to the membrane and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by awitan cluster, more about lansia with participating diseases and pregnant women.
In general, people who are exposed to the virus in large amounts or whose immune function is disrupted have a higher chance of being infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as described above, showed that the incubation period of 4,8 (3,0-7,2) days based on the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is important that the health authorities adjust the effective time of the quarantine based on the most accurate incubation period so that it prevents the person infected, but without symptoms, the transmission of the virus to others.
As a general practice, people exposed to a virus or infected are usually required to be carantined for 14 days.
Do you need to extend the quarantine time to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early symptoms of COVID-19, with or without accompanying other symptoms such as dry cough, discomfort, muscle pain, swelling, headache, throat pain, rinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnoa and/or hypoxemia a week after the start of the disease.
In severe cases, the development of the disease of the patient progresses rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or symptoms of respiratory and acute fever, even without disorders in lung imaging, should be filtered against the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dispnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilator support.
Similar findings were in two recent studies, namely studies on family clusters and clusters caused by transmission from asymptomatic people.
Compared with that, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dispnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with higher MERS mortality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dispnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat pain (13-25%) are shown as the main symptoms and ventilation support is required for around 14%-20% of patients.
By February 14, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2% with confirmed cases reached 66.576 worldwide.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of 8.096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 cases confirmed.
Previous studies that the R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached a high of 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 SARS-CoV reached only 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 is given in Table 1.
These figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capacity compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not equal to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemic.
Clusters are often found in a family or from a group or vehicle such as a vessel.
Patients often have a travel history or reside in Wuhan or other affected districts or interact with the infected person or the patient in the last two weeks before awakening.
However, it is that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients returned from the hospital can carry the virus again.
In the early stages, the number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) is normal or decreased.
For example, lymphopenia with the number of white blood cells < 4×109/L, which includes the number of lymphocytes < 1×109/L, and increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase as well as viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The rate of liver and muscle enzymes as well as myoglobin increases in the blood of a number of patients, as well as the C-reactive protein and the blood flow rate increases in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer rate increases, i.e. the fibrin decomposition product in the blood, and the number of lymphocytes decreases gradually.
Torax photo disorders are found in the large bacteria of COVID-19 patients and are marked by bilateral water shade or ground-glass haziness in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injuries, and acute respiratory failure syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, tacter-controlled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis significantly aggravate gas exchange disorders.
Type I and type II pneumosite dysfunction decreases the surfacing rate and increases surface pressure so that it decreases the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lungs collapse.
Therefore, the worst findings on the photo of toraks often parallel to the severe level of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first COVID-19 pathological analysis showed pneumosite desquamation, the formation of hyalin membranes, and interstitial lymphocytes infiltration, as well as multiple insitial cells in the lungs of the patient who died from this disease, according to the pathology of viral infection and ARDS as well as similar to the pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through reverse polymerase transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to its high level of false negative, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depend only on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
Similar situations occur in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and a necessity to make an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the use of CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a cellulate in less than one hour without requiring complex instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can significantly improve sensitivity and facility if verified on clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with new CoVs, doctors especially offer support treatment to COVID-19 patients, as long as they try a variety of therapies used or previously proposed for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This therapy includes current therapy and potential therapy with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from healed patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from healed patients is recommended to be used in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies are developing antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
At the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at lower levels, such as the gastrointestinal and kidney system.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat for the patient and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extrakorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a thermodified cardiopulmonary short-term technique used for the treatment of heart failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, the care of the electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to lead to cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokine hurricane is a systemic inflammatory response form marked by the cytokine series release degnan, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce the immune cells to release a large number of free radicals which are the main cause of ARDS and failure of the membrane.
Immunosuppression is very important in the treatment of sitokin storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include immun response modulation directed by T cells; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blocking; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppression 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as an immunosuppressant, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are not useful for severe lungs in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, steroids can result in severe side effects, especially osteonekrosis, which greatly affect the prognosis.
However, short doses of low to moderate corticosteroids are recommended to be administered with caution to critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this survey, no effective antivirus therapy has been confirmed.
However, intraveneous remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found nutritious in a COVID-19 patient from the United States.
Remdesivir is a new antivirus drug developed by Gilead, again for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Recently, remdesivir also showed an inhibition of other single-untry RNA viruses, which include MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided this compound for China to perform a series of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results were highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side reactions may occur after combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medications used by the patient should be thoroughly monitored.
Plasma from healed patients and the production of antibodies
There is a long history of blood accumulation of patients who have been healed from a infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from infecting the disease.
In fact, patients who have been healed often have a relatively high level of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodium is the immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight the pathogen as well as other strangers, recognize the unique molecules of the pathogen, and directly neutralize it.
Based on this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of patients who have been healed from COVID-19 and injected to 10 patients with severe illness.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, accompanied by a decrease in inflammation and virus load as well as an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification should be done to introduce such methods for large-scale use before specific therapy is developed.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma-related deficiencies should be considered properly.
For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and plasma is needed in large amounts to treat critical ill patients.
The expansion and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to fight the complicated global epidemic is done.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from healed patients and identify the genetic code that contains effective antibodies or perform effective antibodies filtration against the protein that is essential to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibodies production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of various components in the formula. This formula differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify the components or their optimal combination.
Currently, as the effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 is not yet available, TCM becomes one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe diseases.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and the Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found for COVID-19 therapy.
The highest level of healing in COVID-19 patients therapy was observed in several Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87% of their patients, which included Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the province of Hubei, which used TCM only in about 30% of COVID-19, had the lowest level of healing (13%).
However, this comparison remains very brutal because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his friends multiplied a study that compared Western drug therapy (WM) alone with combined therapy WM and TCM.
They found that the time needed for the body temperature recovery, the loss of symptoms, and home treatment was much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
More impressive, the rate of symptom deterioration (from light to heavy) is much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the mortality is lower in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and security of TCM is still waiting for better-controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to specify the work mechanism and clarify the effective component in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most patients expected or confirmed COVID-19 feel very afraid of this very infectious and even deadly disease, and the person carantined also feels tired, lonely, and angry.
Furthermore, infectious symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as side effects of therapy such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the early stages of the SARS epidemic, a series of psychiatric morbidities, which include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor cramps, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even dysidality have ever been.
Following the contact history and the mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19, can make people more anxious and feel guilty related to the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma on relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19, the expected people, and the people who interact with them, as well as the general community in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with routine and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, and therapeutic plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential to break the transmission chain from the reservoir of infected animals and humans to vulnerable inhabitants and often complement antivirus therapy in controlling the epidemic caused by the appearance of the virus.
The efforts have been made to develop a protein-based S vaccine, which in the long term and effectively makes antibodies penetration and/or immunity that protects against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, living-weakened vaccines have been evaluated on experimental animals.
Nevertheless, the in vivo candidate effect of this vaccine on the lansia and lethal challenge patterns as well as its protection against zoonotic viral infection should still be determined before clinical trials begin.
This is probably because the SARS broke down 17 years ago and no new cases have been since that moment.
Instead, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued existence of zoonotic sources in the endemic district.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles, and recombination protein subunits and have been partially evaluated on experimental animals.
The expansion of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to overcome due to the long time to develop the vaccine (an average of 18 months) and the dynamic variation of CoV.
As a new disease, the new COVID-19 began to show its full clinical journey to thousands of patients.
In the majority of cases, the patient can rely on healing without sequela.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the formation of a disease prognosis model is very important for the healthcare body to prioritize its services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies to this extent, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also occurs for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurs in the ages of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over the age of 50 in the study contained 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care tend to have complications and complications as well as significantly older than patients in need of intensive care (median age of 66 years compared to 51 years), which indicates age as a prognostic factor for the final result of COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0,31/100,000 compared to 0,27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive treatment are more likely to have acute heart injuries and arithmia.
Heart attacks are also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also to be associated with colangiocytes with ACE2-positive, which can lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are very correlated and can affect each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and is proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
Correlations between the CRP rate and severity as well as the COVID-19 prognosis were also proposed.
In addition, increased laktate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help forecast the final result.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are a traditional indicator for heart and liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: Photo of the torace and the development of temporary clinical symptoms should be considered together with other things to predict the final results and complications of COVID-19.
Using steroids: As described above, the steroid is an immunosuppressant which is widely used as a thinning therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high doses of corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many people who survive from this disease eventually suffer from avascular osteonekrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used at low doses and short periods of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from extraordinary stress as they have to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witnessing the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological advice and long-term support should be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have a different epidemiological picture of SARS.
In addition to replications in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or unsymptomatic symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause swelling.
Therefore, in the early stages or in the time of incubation, infected patients can produce viruses in large amounts during daily activities, causing great difficulties in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when the patient is severe and most does not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 epidemic is far more severe and difficult to control than the SARS.
Currently, large efforts are being made in China, which includes the quarantine of the Wuhan province and surrounding cities as well as the continued quarantine of the entire population with the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions greatly damaged the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients decreased, which indicates the slowdown of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates say the epidemic will end in March and the decline phase lasts for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimates that COVID-19, which seems much more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the end result of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
The Canadian research group that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-conca usp and throat of patients who had been healed and returned from the hospital 2 weeks earlier. This indicates that the re-identified virus could be repeated episodes, similar to the flu.
However, promising signs occur in China, if seen based on the decline in the number of new cases, which indicates that the current strategy may be successful.
Ebola is expected to cause one million cases with half deaths.
However, with rigorous quarantine and isolation, the disease can eventually be managed.
Per, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappears or becomes a non-patogenic virus that can be associated with humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 epidemics with SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Gbr.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through cough or swelling, and may also be through direct contact with a substance contaminated by the virus.
The virus is also found in feses so that it triggers the possibility of a new transmission, i.e. a feses-to-mouth transmission.
Recent studies on 138 cases that 41% of cases could be caused by nosocomial infection, which included 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, fair preventive measures should be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even people who accidentally collapse with the patient or the infected person.
The first defense line that could be used to reduce the risk of infection was through the use of face masks, both surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (serie number 1860s) helping to deal with the spread of the virus.
The surgical mask ensures that the scratch of a person who is potentially infected is not according to the air or attached to the surface of the material, where the scratch of the scratch can be transmitted to others.
However, only the N95 mask (serious number of the 1860s) can protect against virion inhalations with a small size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can fully methhetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of measurement, both are about 85 nm.
Since the particles can melt even five surgical masks accumulated into one, healthcare providers that contact the patient directly should wear N95 (serious number 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to the mask, health care providers should wear a suitable isolation dress to further reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing a N95 mask; the virus could enter his body through inflammation in the eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear a face shield or glasses as long as they work with the patient.
For the general community in the affected or potentially affected districts, it is highly recommended for each person to wash his hands with disinfected soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for self-determination, and avoid contact with the potentially infected person.
A distance of three feet is believed to be appropriate to keep a distance from the patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homologation with SARS-CoV, as on January 7, 2020, must be a big warning for China that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS epidemic.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center calmed the population by saying that the new virus has low spread characteristics and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and the prevention and prevention of the disease is not a problem.
This message very calmed the fears of the public, especially when the whole state is preparing the Summer Festival, so this critical time is delayed to prevent the still small-scale disease in Wuhan.
The disease management agency in China should quote lessons from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, the body should (1) be more cautious when making public announcements because each word is observed by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from the clinic than waiting for official reports from the doctor or authorized officer; (3) more restrictive to prevent the potential epidemic at the early stages, rather than to try to calm the public; and (4) more frequently conduct targeted and effective training to increase public awareness of the epidemic and test and improve the system of public response periodically.
COVID-19 is caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began spreading at the end of December 2019.
In less than 2 months, the epidemic has spread throughout China and more than 50 countries around the world at the time of writing this survey.
Because the virus is very similar to the SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 epidemic affects as a repeated SARS epidemic.
However, there are a few clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which is essential to preventing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 is more about lansia than young people and more about men than women, as well as a higher mortality rate in lansia than young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are without symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are seriously ill. This makes it more difficult to block the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains some of the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA acai for SARS-CoV-2 testing can give negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been healed can give positive results again to the virus examination.
These findings significantly increase the risk of viral spread.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19, some important issues still need to be solved, namely:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology is found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like CoVs, we are still unable to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from the SARS.
What animals are the intermediate species to transmit the virus from the original inches, say the wheat, to humans?
Without knowing the answer number 1 and 2, we cannot effectively interrupt the transmission and the epidemic can spread back every moment.
Although molecular and biochemical modeling indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, how exactly the virus enters the respiratory tract cells and leads to further pathological changes?
Is this virus also associated with the cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot a quick and accurate diagnosis as well as effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Will this pandemic be a worldwide pandemic, ending like SARS, or repeated periodically like flu?
Answers to the above questions and many other statements are important, but it may take time to find them.
However, no matter how much it costs, we have no other choice than stop this epidemic as soon as possible to get back to normal life.
The zoonotic corona virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have moved the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its body, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild diseases, such as selesma.
Heavy acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverse the situation and reveal how HCoV infection can be very damaging and life-threatening.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has made CoV a remark and surprised us with high transmission, but with lower pathogenicity than its brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonosis. Therefore, the original understanding of the zoonotic HCoV will be beneficial for us.
The majority of HCoVs come from cattle. In these animals, the virus is not pathogenic.
Inang reservoir of several HCoV intermediaries has also been known.
The identification of animals has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Research on CoV-income interactions in animals can also provide an important insight into the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this survey, we present an overview of the current knowledge of seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of its discovery as well as its zoonotic origin and interspesial transmission.
Importantly, we compare and highlight these HCoVs from the point of view of evolution and genom recombination.
The 2019 CoV disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful transition and the implications of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also noted.
Corona viruses (CoVs) come from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of RNA viruses that are swallowed, positively swallowed and single swallowed.
The virus has the largest genom with a size of 26 to 32 kilobas among the RNA virus called "CoV", because its morphology is corona-like under an electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CoV has a non-segmented genom that has a similar rating.
Approximately two-thirds of the genom consists of two large open reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b) that interact with each other. The two are translated into polyprotein replications pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein undergoes further processing to form 16 non-structualized proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genom consists of an open reading frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which includes a spike (S), a tub or envelope (E), a membrane (M), and a nucleoprotein (N).
A number of supplementary proteins specific to a particular line of descendance are also marked by a variety of CoV line of descendance.
Based on differences in protein sequence, CoV is classified into four genes (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four genes, the beta-CoV genes have the most HCoV and are divided into four line of succession (A, B, C, and D).
Philogenetic evidence suggests that cattle and pets are a major source of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while birds are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continually crossed the barrier of the species and some CoV has become an important pathogen in humans.
So far, there are seven human CoVs (HCoVs) known.
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as coughing and/or diarrhea.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing infection of the subdual tract in relatively more patients and have higher chances of developing into acute respiratory disorders syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung organs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the patient's gums that had selesma in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through a thorough study of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which both lead to self-help symptoms.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is generally harmful, until SARS epidemic occurs.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 was one of the most damaging epidemics in history today, which infected more than 8,000 people with a brutal death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the epidemic of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to an ongoing epidemic in the Arab Peninsula with sporadic spread to different parts of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), further referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic associative agent, which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
The alarm has already sounded and the world has to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have a zoonotic origin from cattle, mice, or pets.
Many evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from pearls. In pearls, CoVs are well adapted and are nonpatogenic, but show a great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has caused an extraordinary medical, scientific, social and moral challenge for China and the whole world.
The HCoV zoonotic origin tracking provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the driving force, and the limiting factor of the occurrence of transition between species.
The study can also drive or facilitate animal reservoir, mediator, and SARS-CoV-2 amplification search, which has significant implications in the prevention of future spread.
In this survey, we provide an overview of the zoonotic origin, interspesial transmission, and HCoV pathogenesis.
We specifically emphasize and discuss the general topic that the HCoV maternal virus is usually non-patogenic in its alamin reservoir, but becomes pathogenic after transmitting interspesial into new inches.
We also review HCoV evolution trends that increased transmission capacity is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The end result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the isolation of the first HCoV-229E strain B814 from the angus patients affected by selesma, a variety of CoVs have been isolated from a variety of infected animals, which include calkun, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A short summary of the history of HCoV discoveries in chronological sequence (Table 1) is an informative indicator.
Strain HCoV-229E was first isolated from the respiratory tract of patients who had an infection of the upper respiratory tract in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to be grown in the lung cell line WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E show symptoms of selesma, which include headaches, swelling, sickness, and throat pain, accompanied by fever and cough that are seen in 10-20% of cases.
Furthermore, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the body culture and sequential series tracks in the still breastfeeding scratch brain.
The clinical picture of the HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is sympathically unlikely with other pathogenic respiratory tract infections such as the influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread throughout the world and tend to be most broadcast during winter in the middle climate districts.
Usually, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week and followed by a pain period of about 2 weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E had a mild malaria.
Only a few patients with weakened immune system indicate infection of the underweight respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypic pneumonia", is the first well-documented HCoV pandemic in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
The first SARS case could be investigated back to the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases with 774 deaths, which spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the super-infectant, each case is expected to cause about two secondary cases, with the incubation time of 4 to 7 days and the peak of the virus burden is visible on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headaches, fever, lesion, and swelling, followed by dispnea, cough, and breathing disorders as a symptom of advanced levels.
Lymphopenia, an abnormal liver function test, and an increase in creatine kinase are a common laboratory disorder in SARS.
Alveolar diffusion damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and an increase in macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Furthermore, about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidney can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by a sitokin storm, which can be fatal, especially in patients with weak immunity.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of null-patient relatives who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
This virus was initially very common in young children, lansia, and patients with weak immunity suffering from respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of corrose, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation from a 8-month-old kid's nasal sample suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread throughout the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of general respiratory diseases and its peak occur in the early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called crupes.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been to be associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found around the world, causing mild respiratory diseases.
These four HCoV communities have fully adapted to humans and generally have a small probability of mutation into a very pathogenic disease. However, extraordinary cases actually occur due to unknown reasons, such as in the case of the subtype HCoV-NL63 more virulent that has recently been to cause infection of the underweight respiratory tract in China.
Generally, when it gets the ability to move effectively and continue to defend itself in humans, the virulence and pathogenity of this HCoV also decreases.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases come from the Middle East, import cases with occasional secondary spread to close contact have been in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary incident occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 cases confirmed.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to the clinical manifestations of SARS, which are characterized by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which so far only occurs in MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were with high cases of death, which was 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most scary viruses known to humans.
In the middle to the end of December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients retrospectively linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the underdeath infection epidemic that is ongoing and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and called the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with the total death toll of cases of 3.4%.
The death toll in Hubei, China, was 4.2%, while the death toll outside Hubei was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with images of fever, cough, and breathing failure.
Diare is also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory disorder syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they both group into different philogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity is clearly lower, but more infectious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms have been and may play a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoV shows very interesting equations and differences.
First, the incubation time and the duration of the HCoV disease is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trends of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other HCoV communities (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture of HCoV Community infection, which includes a picture of mild or even unspecific symptoms.
On the other hand, a small portion of severe COVID-19 cases may seem like SARS-CoV infection even with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows attractive pattern characteristics, having similarities with the HCoV community and the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the HCoV community.
On the other hand, a decrease in the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 after several lines in humans still need to be diverified, such as cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from feses samples.
"Whether the SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission plays an important role, as in the case of the SARS-CoV transmission, at least in a specific situation, it still needs to be cleared by further studies."
What is also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the HCoV community case.
In any case, the image of SARS-CoV-2, which covers the transmission capacity, pathogenicity, and continuous spread in several trains in humans, will greatly influence the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic.
Four HCoV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may be an ancient HCoV pandemic species.
HCoV that causes severe diseases in humans and humans who suffer from severe HCoV pain has been destroyed.
In order to do this, HCoV should replicate in humans in sufficient amounts to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations to be used against the limiting factor.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic survives and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood of the virus to fully adapt to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other measures of infection control.
Over the years, four CoV communities circulated in the human population and triggered selesma in people with immunokompetence.
This virus does not require an animal reservoir.
Instead, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not adapted to humans and their transmission in humans cannot beined.
Both must defend themselves and reproduce in zoonotic reservoirs as well as seek the opportunity to spread to the vulnerable human target, possibly through one or more inches of intermediate and amplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar image to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted as HCoV community, at least today.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than the HCoV community and is not homogeneous to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is still to be observed whether the SARS-CoV-2 will be fully adapted to humans and circulate in humans without reservoir animal houses or intermediaries.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, mediator, and HCoV amplification.
Animal acts as an evolutionary HCoV inheritance if it has close-friendly ancestors and shares high homologies at the sequence level of the nucleotide.
The ancestral viruses are usually well adapted and are nonpatogenic in these inches.
Likewise, the inches of the reservoir carry HCoV continuously and in a long period of time.
In these two cases, the wheat is naturally infected and is a natural wheat for HCoV or maternal virus.
Instead, if the new HCoV enters the mediator inches right before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus is not adapted to the new inches and is often pathogenic.
This mediator can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play a role as an amplification injury by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, then transmit it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoV may be infected if it is unable to maintain its transmission in the intermediate inheritance.
Instead, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate inches and even cause long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate inings become the natural reservoir inings.
Epidemiological data reveal retrospective that zero cases of SARS have a history of contact with pets.
Further seroprevalence studies indicate that sellers of the animals have a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
The moon mushroom (Paguma larvata) and the rack dogs in the live animal market are the first identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been since all the mushrooms in the market were killed.
As a result, it is that moon mush from wildlife or farms that are not exposed to the market of the living animals mostly give negative test results for SARS-CoV. This indicates that moon mush may only act as an intermediate amplification inhabit, but not a natural resorvoir for SARS-CoV.
It should be noted, since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be excluded that many small species of mammals also serve as SARS-CoV intermediate amplification inches.
All these inings seem to be the final inings of SARS-CoV.
Natural animal housing search for SARS-CoV further revealed a close-friendly coV, called the coV Rhinolopus family-SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the Chinese horse tapal coV.
The drug provides positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the sequence of the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genom.
These CoVs and other coVs share the homology of the 88-92% nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoVs.
The study became the foundation for a new concept that the cranberries are the cranberries for newly emerging human pathogens.
Some SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) are also identified from the drug, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
The angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 that originates from the samples of the wheat feses is shown to use the ACE2 wheat, wheat, and humans as a receptor to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the SARS patient serum can neutralize WIV1.
Until now, WIV1 represents the closest-friendly ancestor to SARS-CoV in the wheat, with a nucleotide sequence homology of 95%.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct SARS-CoV mother virus and a non-inative SARS-CoV reservoir.
Philogenetic analysis group MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 mercury.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same inhaled receptor, i.e. peptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), as the entrance path of the virus.
The sequence of polymerase RNA depending on MERS-CoV RNA is filogenetically closer to its equivalent in the identified beta-CoV gene from Europe and Africa.
Until now, no living MERS-CoV has been found in the wild.
MERS-CoV and its closest coV-HKU25 relatives share only 87% of the homology of the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, the wire may not be a MERS-CoV direct reservoir.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East showed that Arab camels give seropositive results to specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like the camels of the Middle East in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives identical to the virus found in humans is isolated from the Arab camel nasal usap. This further indicates that the camel is the real reservoir inang for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive viral pollution with usually mild symptoms is observed in experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that the infected camel sends the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fekal-oral route, which is also the main route of the viral transmission from the worm.
Nevertheless, the question is still unanswered because many cases of MERS confirmed have no history of contact with camels before the symptoms, the probability of a human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission route involving unknown species of animals carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of the nucleotide homology with the RaTG13 coV isolated from the Rhinolophus affinis coV.
Like in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too big to establish a maternal relationship.
In other words, it may not be a SARS-CoV-2 direct reservoir, unless the near identical coV is found later.
Probably, the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal habitat is among the wild satwa species sold and killed in the Huanan Sea Food Wholesale Market. Many early cases of COVID-19 are related to this market, which indicates the possibility of the occurrence of animal-to-human transmission.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequence show that a small group of threatened mammals, known as trenggiling (Sweet javanica), may also bear an ancestor beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This new coV grinding genom shares 85-92% homology of nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is equally close to the RaTG13 with an equality of 90% at the sequence level of the nucleotide.
Both of them are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in a philogenetic tree, one sharing a more similar receptor bonding domain (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2, with a 97.4 percent amino acid sequence equation.
Surprisingly, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are far more different, although the homological level of the whole genom sequence is higher.
Previous studies on sick swelling also detection of contig virus from lung samples, which also found to be associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different arrangement methods and manual curations to produce a partial genom sequence consisting of about 86.3% of the complete virus genom.
We cannot exclude the possibility of trenggiling as one of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal houses.
However, at the moment there is no evidence that supports SARS-CoV-2 originating directly from swelling due to the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 swelling.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in cranberries, cranberries, and other mammals is still to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology on RBD is found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-Relative-SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homology at the sequence level of the entire genom.
Too speculative if it is said that the high level of similarity between the beta-CoV-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the convergence evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
Comparative hypotheses support recombination between beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As an evolutionary factor, many recombinations occur among beta-CoVs.
The researchers are still unable to determine the origin of the zoonotic SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, zoonotic origin HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Philogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be derived from coV, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 indigenous viruses have been found in fertilizers.
It is that the ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) coV detected in the North American three-colored coV showed close frequency to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically associated with other coal coal, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae allegedly also being a residence among them.
To make it clearer, the current knowledge of the known HCoV animal origin is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Philogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrence of HCoV interspesial transmission in history.
In about 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed species from livestock to infect humans, a pandemic of respiratory infection was.
The history of transmission of HCoV-229E between species is not too clear.
Alpha-CoV, which is associated with HCoV-229E, has been discovered.
Among them, there is alpha-CoV alpaka.
Some evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from worms to humans.
First of all, humans, not alpha, who may bite with the mercury in a joint ecological shell.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpaca.
Second, the alpha-CoV, which is associated with HCoV-229E, is varied and nonpatogenic in the alpha, while the alpha-CoV causes a respiratory disease epidemic in infected animals.
Ultimately, alpha-CoV alpaka is not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpha-CoV getting alpha-CoV-HCoV-229E from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, worms are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not so surprising that the worms may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Other possibilities, while the alpha-CoV is functioning as a HCoV-229E gen pollen, alpaca and Arab camels may be functioning as a mediator that transmits the virus to humans, just like the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of transmitting interspesies from cattle to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from the worms is known on the early identification of the virus and is also strengthened by the subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that the cranberries are a plumber of a rich viral species for the exchange of genetic fragments between species and transmissions between species.
Long age, closely organized colonies, close social interactions, and strong flight capabilities, all of them are the supporting conditions for mercury to become an ideal 'virus spread'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has entered the Arab camel for decades.
The virus has been adapted with a camel that has changed from an intermediate inang to a stable and natural reservoir inang.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease andins a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans occurs by coincidence and humans remain the final inches for MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the role of the camel in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of the twist, if there is, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Especially, beta-CoV swelling is very pathogenic in swelling.
Toughened Laminated Safety Glass may be the final injection for the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, similar to the injection in the SARS-CoV case.
In future studies, some possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions between species from animals to humans should be considered or excluded.
First, it can be a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 relatives that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings can share the ecological relun with the mercury through the murder or mining of curve stones.
Second, trenggiling may be one of the intermediate amplification inches for the newly entered SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Humans get the virus through slaughter and consumption of fisherman’s meat.
Per, many mammals, which include pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An antibodies to animal and wild animals should be examined.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that interfere both with the cranberries and the cranberries.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 animal origin is still ongoing.
Despite the various types of animal habitat, three main factors from the viral side are also important to facilitate CoV crossing the species barrier.
First, its mutation rate is relatively high in the RNA replication.
Compared to other single-wheeled RNA viruses, the estimated rate of CoV mutation can be considered “sized” to “high” with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 per year per site, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to the new inches.
CoV has an exoribonuclease correction, elimination that results in extremely high mutability, atenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the Remdesivir nucleotide analogue is known to suppress CoV replications through the inhibition of this exoribunuclease and RNA polimerase depending on the RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of CoV mutation is about a million times higher than the rate of its home mutation.
Moreover, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoV is not adapted to the inches.
Compared to SARS-CoV that has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is actually lower, indicating a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other humans that are close to human relationships.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV that has been adapted to Arab camels.
Theoretically, there is little possibility that genetic outbreak will quickly make the vaccine and antivirus agent against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genom in CoV gives additional flexibility in genom modification, for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the probability of interspesial co-evolutions, which is beneficial for the appearance of new CoV at the time of the appropriate conditions.
It is supported by a lot of unique open reading framework and protein function that is encrypted towards the end of the 3′ genom.
Third, CoV regularly changes the template randomly during the RNA replication through the unique “selection-copy” mechanism.
In inks that serve as a mixing container, wire transitions occur frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Complete and highly homologated subgenomic RNA can experience recombination to form a new CoV.
The philogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoV such as SL-CoV and CoV-HKU9.
The interaction of viruses in relation to transmission.
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the indigenous receptor is another major factor that affects the transmission between species.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is considered as a special example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during the occurrence of interspesial transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between human and mushroom SARS-CoV isolates, SARS-CoV is expected to experience rapid adaptation in various inches, especially with mutations in RBD protein S.
In general, RBD protein S CoV interacts with the cell receptors and intensely becomes the target response of the inhaled antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the fragment S1, which connects with human ACE2 as well as its receptor as the entrance of the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize the ACE2 receptors of a variety of animals, which include cattle, mushrooms, mice, and cattle dogs, thus enabling the transmission of interspesial viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues are observed different between human virus and mushroom isolates in RBD and 4 of them are located on the motivation of the receptor bonding for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV mushroom has mutations of K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of tonic protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be essential for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S units implies that the affinity of S protein bonding with human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed the human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 protein bonding affinity 10 to 20 times higher than the human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein bonding affinity.
What is also important to know is whether there are other receptors that may be needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2..
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also connected to ACE2, but with different parts on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-teracetylated silic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after interspesial transmission from their animals.
In addition to cell receptors, the final result of interspesial HCoV transmission is also regulated by other dependency factors and inhabit limitations.
These differences between humans and natural reservoir humans, such as pearls, Arab camels, and fertilizers, can be an obstacle to interspesial transmission.
HCoV must take over the indigenous dependency factor and embodiment the indigenous limitation factor in order to succeed in interspesial transmission.
In this case, the molecular determinants in the field of these important viral interactions still need to be identified and characterized.
Filtering the entire genom of the unparalleled to see the dependency factor and residential limitation of SARS-CoV-2 using the advanced CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
The Emergency of New HCoV: Back to the Early Epidemic
The diversity of CoV cells gives a great opportunity for the appearance of a new HCoV.
In this case, CoV acetate acts as a HCoV gen pollen.
Furthermore, rapid mutations and genetic recombinations also drive the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein receptor genes may potentially drastically modify the phenotype of the virus.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is supposed to play an important role in adaptation to humans because the isolated SARS-CoV virus is found to contain a variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with special characteristics of 29 nucleotide removal found on isolated strains at the beginning of human epidemic.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is supposed to be an adaptive mutation that supports inhaled transition.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV descent lines, with a large number of smaller recombination areas identified in RNA polymerases dependent on RNA.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and partly nsp14.
Similarly, the incidence of recombination between the various line of descendants shown occurred in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in Arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination phenomena have also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoV experiences recombination with other animal CoVs in its non-structured genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can play a role in unintentional changes in the viral genom, most likely resulting from the release of the virus from the selected pressure, such as by the immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 on the prototype HCoV-229E strain due to the elimination of two nucleotide.
While full ORF4 can be observed on the HCoV-229E-related worms and camels, alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide inputs that lead to a frame shift.
Lastly, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by the selection pressure in its reservoir building.
A mild or unsymptomatic symptom is detected at the time of CoV infection, which indicates mutual adaptation between CoV and CoV.
It appears to be well adapted to CoV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the proinflammatory response in the wheat will effectively decrease the pathology caused by CoV.
In addition, the activity of the natural killer cells on the cells is under pressure due to increased regulation of the receptor of the natural killer cells inhibitors NKG2/CD94 and the low level of molecular expression of the complexity of the main histokompatibility of class I.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the high metabolic activity of the mercury can suppress CoV replications and affect the correction by exoribonuclease so giving selective pressure for the production of highly pathogenic viral strains when entering the new building.
More pathogenic CoV strain may also develop through recombination, which leads to the acquisition of protein or new protein features for indigenous adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoV is non-patogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir inches, such as pearls and camels.
CoV reacts strongly without triggering a strong immune response.
Here is the secret of the presence of a carrier without symptoms and the cause of severe cases of human infection.
The symptoms are severe especially due to the activation of excessive immune response as well as a sitokin storm, with increased lung damage if the immune response is stronger.
Instead, in the non-symptomatic carrier, the immune response has been missing from the CoV replication.
The same strategy to resolve the relevance of immune response may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon responses are especially strong on the wheat.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflamasom of NLRP3 in the wheat is defective.
For this reason, the inhibition of the inflamasome NLRP3 with MCC950 may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general flow of the appearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoV molecules that share 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also coV molecules that share 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although mushrooms and other animals on the market were found to carry the same virus as SARS-CoV, a direct mediator for SARS-CoV-2 was not found.
Very homologated beta-CoV scratching with SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, which indicates that scratching may play a role as one of the intermediate inings or beta-CoV scratching may contribute to gen fragments on the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although it is still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made by humans either intentionally or accidentally.
CoV returned to the center of attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
CoV studies in cattle and other animals have dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoir for HCoV on human transmission.
A lot of evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are derived from cells and are transmitted to humans through intermediate inches.
Given that the SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and mushrooms in the wet markets, it is possible that the closure of the wet market and the murder of all mushrooms in it that ends the SARS epidemic effectively.
For the same reason, dragging should be transferred from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, taking into account the discovery of a number of beta-CoV dragging line that is close to SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the truth and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through scratching and other mammals still need to be cleared in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been in the Arab camel.
It serves as an important transportation tool as well as a major source for meat, milk, skin, and wol products for the local community.
Arab stones are widely spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we are unlikely to kill all the camels to deal with MERS, as is done in the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the MERS epidemic, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop the vaccine to comes that is effective against MERS-CoV and combined with other measures of infection control.
Before we succeed in removing this virus, a new genotype can appear and cause an epidemic.
A variety of Zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, the potential zoonotic coV is very diverse.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and experience recombination, which leads to the appearance of new CoVs that are more easily transmitted and/or more fatal for humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the gorgeous experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparations and delay plans should be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet for a long time.
These viruses are in the alamin reservoir until there is a chance for spread.
Though pearls have many characteristics that support the spread of viruses, human chances of collapse with pearls and other wild species can be minimized if people are dislocated to get away from wild animals.
Continuous surveillance of mammals should be done to better understand the ecology of CoV and its alamin, which will prove beneficial in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the zoonosis of the virus is that humans should keep a distance from the ecological reservoir of the natural zoonotic virus.
Some parts of the original zoonotic puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 have not been discovered.
First, if the wheat transmits the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to the wheat, the condition when the wheat and wheat share the ecological wheat is important to know.
Secondly, if the bearers have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans interact with the bearers should be determined.
Thirdly, if there is a third mammal that plays the role of the real intermediary, the way the mammal interacts with other species, which includes humans, pearls, and pearls should be clarified.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infection and surveillance should be done.
Whether it’s a pineapple, pineapple, or other mammals, it’s expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical maternal virus may be identified in its future alamines.
Continuing research in this field will dissolve the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and handling of COVID-19 in humans.
The update of the diagnostic criteria “predictable case” and “confirmed case” COVID-19 must be carried out
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 new coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and becomes a good reference to fighting pandemic worldwide.
Although the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing on the basis of ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuing to be updated.
In this letter, we respond to one of the comments in our guidelines and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “predictable cases” and “confirmed cases” based on the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic, which is currently formally called the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was named acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance and the guidance was published online in Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This guide has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing on the basis of ongoing research findings as well as clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuing to be updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the Commission has issued a total of seven editions with some context has been modified quite much.
Our guides received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a proposal to give a moderate score based on their clinical experience.
Their results add new evidence to our guidelines as well as become a valuable reference to this pandemic worldwide.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work results also require updates based on the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for the latest COVID-19 (seventh test version) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the expected case is required a combination of one of the epidemiological history images with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or the completion of three clinical manifestations is required if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and its surrounding districts, or other communities where the COVID-19 case has been in the last 14 days before the symptoms occur; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with a positive nuclear acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and its surrounding districts, or other communities where the COVID-19 case has been in the last 14 days before the symptoms occur; (4) history of contact with the cluster of cases confirmed (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) COVID-19 infection imaging features; (3) the total number of white blood cells indicates a normal number of lymphocytes, decreased, or decreased at the early awakening stage.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on the expected case with one of the pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the entire virus genom sequence indicates high homogenity for new known coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the serum test; or the change of specific IgG antibodies-SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or the titer increases ≥4 times in the recovery phase above the rate in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nuclear acid in the respiratory or blood tract sample was added on the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic detection on blood samples was added in the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020); then, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on the researchers’ ongoing research to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood intake, which improves the availability of various samples, and supports the participation of positive results of certain antibodies in confirmed criteria.
Furthermore, there are more and more evidence that reminds us to be alert to patients with atypical symptoms and without symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al. flows should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as “low-risk”.
The score system should also be diverified in future practice and clinical studies.
In conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will appear and ask the reader to comment.
For the diagnosis of “predictable cases” and “confirmed cases”, we advise to follow and follow the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team will also periodically update our guidelines as a help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death rate
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh the total number of cases of infection recorded included 114 active cases and 33 cases of healing living at home.
There were 17 deaths.
In an online news report, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41-50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.

On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Road and Bridge Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport will be stopped longer than planned, until next Saturday.
The public transport stop has begun on March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of trees - medical, fuel, and food - is still permitted.
The first incident of COVID-19 infection recorded in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two newly returned people from Italy and the wife of one of them.
On the 19th of March, the three people were healed.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is more than one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak occurred the same day when Malawi confirmed its first corona virus infection and Zambia suffered its first corona virus-related death.
North Korea claimed on Thursday that the country is one of the few countries that remain free from coronavirus infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) 1.051.635 confirmed cases, including 79.332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Middle European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Office, which quoted Johns Hopkins University data, there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infection.
Worldwide, countries announce stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, mayor of Moscow, extended the quarantine of the province to 1 May.
National President Vladimir Putin said that Russian citizens will remain paid without having to go to work until April 30th.
The Portuguese parliament held a vote to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes for, ten votes abstain, and one votes for.

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has announced that the state has extended the residence order until May 1.
Australian shops reduce the boundary for the purchase of toilet fabric per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, the Australian shop network Woolworth and Coles, respectively, reduced the limits for the purchase of toilet fabric to two and one packs per transaction in all stores at the national level.
ALDI also applies the limit of one pack, on Monday.
This restriction was announced as a message on the kasir and on the Facebook page of its network.
The buyerly concentrated the supplies due to the fear of COVID-19 if the community had to do self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet fabric for delivery to the home to one pack per order.
The change followed the limitation of four packs per transaction which was previously applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
In a media statement on March 8, Coles that with the implementation of the four-pack restrictions, "many stores are still out within an hour since delivery", and said the request "not ever happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unpredictable".
Sales "growed sharply" last week, according to one spokesman Woolworths.
Costco stores in Canberra also restricted the amount allowed to two packs last week.
To avoid uncertainty, Coles orders larger packaging from the supplier and increases the frequency of delivery, Woolworths orders additional supplies, while ALDI makes preparations for special Wednesday promotional activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, the executive director of the Australian Commercial Association, said that the commercial is trying to improve the supply, but the limitations of the local government body for the time of delivery of trucks make it difficult.
It anticipates an increase in production costs, as long as suppliers seek to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores were unable to hold a special Wednesday because they had dismissed the supply early.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the store fills the preparations every night.
It emphasizes that toilet tissues are goods with a large volume so that the amount of supply is low and, if sold out, make a lot of empty space on the rocks so that the weakness of the goods becomes more sensitive.
Coles and Woolworths argue that if there is a lot of goods on the rack, if products such as toilet tissue and sanitation can be purchased and in large amounts, panic could be minimized, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News Office.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet tissue Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of preparation.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Cleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, emphasized they worked 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, that some real estate sellers offered free toilet tissue to the first auction drug in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because buyers took a jade for a long weekend work day.
The NT News Thursday edition, a daily paper printed in Darwin, contains eight pages of inscriptions intended to be cut and used as toilet fabric.
The stores actually refused to apply the restrictions, according to ABC Australia's March 3 report, they said they didn't plan to apply the restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitation, dried food, handwashing soap, and flour.
Also outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon, the UK online supermarket Ocado was observed restricting the purchase of Andres toilet tissue to two packs containing 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declares COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic—a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemia" only refers to how broad the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case, the WHO notes the need to encourage the government to act:
Every country can change the path of this pandemic.
If the country detects, tests, deals, isolates, and mobilizes its people as a response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General said.
We are very wary due to the level of spread and severity that worries or due to the level of slowness of action that worries.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic "has never happened before."
He said, in a report published by CNN in February, “except for influenza, no respiratory virus has been traced from its appearance to its continued global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, “and we’ve never seen a pandemic that can be handled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status followed the WHO decision in January that stated that the epidemic was a disruption of the world.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic, "it hopes, the epidemic will worsen."
Until Thursday, Associated Press there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is a 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) that is ongoing and caused by the coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Wabah identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared as a World Health Decrease on January 30, 2020, and declared as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
Around 364,000 people have been healed.
The mortality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide ranges from 13,04% to 0,08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing discomfort.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory failure syndrome.
The time from exposure to symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There are no known vaccines or specific antivirus treatments.
Recommended preventive actions include washing hands, closing the mouth at the time of cough, keeping a distance from others, and monitoring as well as independent isolation of people expected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by applying travel restrictions, quarantines, night hours, workplace hazard handling, and facility closure.
This pandemic has led to severe global socio-economic disruptions, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sports activities, and the extent of uncertainty of the supply of goods that is aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have been closed at both national and local levels in 193 countries, which affects about 99.4 percent of the student population around the world.
Missinformation about the virus has spread online and there are incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with descendants and appearances in Eastern and Southeast Asia, and people who come from the area with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of the reduction in travel and the closure of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions decrease.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (Hubei propincy capital) a cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and the research was carried out in early January 2020.
The cases are largely related to the Huanan Sea Food Wholesale Market and therefore the virus is supposed to have zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic was named SARS-CoV-2, the newly discovered and associated with the coronavirus, coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with the symptoms was later known to get sick on 1 December 2019, and the person did not have a clear connection with the moist market cluster mentioned later.
Among the initial case clusters in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced on November 17, 2019, at a 55-year-old from the Hubei province, is likely to be the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO that, with new cases decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of China has exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a large number of cases that are not, especially among people with milder symptoms.
Until February 26, a relatively small number of cases among young people, with people under the age of 19 forming 2.4% of cases around the world. British chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the British population needs to be infected before group immunity can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
Until March 23, no country tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, until January 23, it was estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is expected to be greater than the case.
The initial estimate of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure was likely to be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients are healed.
For those who are not healed, the time from the development of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19.
In China, until February 5, about 80% of deaths occur in people over the age of 60 and 75% have previously existing health disorders, which include cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in general refers to the deceased who gave the positive test results for COVID according to the official protocol.
The actual number of fatalities caused by COVID-19 may be much higher, given that the official numbers are likely not to include the person who died without testing, for example, at home, in the home of care, etc.
Parcial data from Italy found that the total surplus number of deaths during a pandemic exceeded the official COVID death calculations with a factor of 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged, "We know [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual figure," a statement strengthened by non-scientific reports about the calculations too low in the U.S. Too low calculations often appear in pandemic, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside of China land occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14.
By February 28, outside China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy respectively.
Until March 13, more than forty countries and territorial territories have deaths, on each continent, except for the Antarctica.
These numbers vary depending on the region and over time, as well as influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time since the first epidemic, and the character of the population such as age, gender, and health as a whole. Death ratio to cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a determined time interval.
According to the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the mortality rate for cases globally was 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) by 10 April 2020.
These numbers vary according to the region.
In China, the estimated death rate for cases decreased from 17.3% (for people with symptom awakening 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptom awakening after 1 February 2020).Other measurements include the case fatality figure (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed dying from a specific disease, and the infection fatality figure (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) dying from a specific disease.
These statistics are not timely bound and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for a specific population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the number of infection fatalities for pandemic overall between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The top limit of this estimate range coincides with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical summary that analyzes the impact of the assessment on the CFR estimates.
The WHO says this pandemic can be managed.
The peak and end duration of the epidemic are unclear and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University said, “Without managed, the infectious epidemic is usually vertical and then begins to decrease when the disease is over.
However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable projection at the moment about when it happens.”
China's senior government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said that "this epidemic may end in June" if the whole country could be mobilized to follow the WHO's advice on steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly up to one or two years."
According to the Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other measures will be required "until the vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's little likely that this coronavirus, because it's very easily transmitted, can disappear completely" and the disease "may be transformed into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Repeat virulence will depend on the group immunity and mutation level.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and the infected person can be without any symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory sputum (flegma), loss of absorption, breathing discomfort, joint and muscle pain, throat pain, headache, swelling, vomiting, hemopathy, diarrhea, or sianosis. WHO that about one in six people become severe and experience breathing difficulties.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including difficulty breathing, stressed chest or sitting chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and bleeding on the face and lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms appear. further development of the disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory disorder syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some people infected may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with the results of tests that confirm the infection, therefore, the researchers suggest that those who are in close contact with the person who confirmed the infection should be closely monitored and checked to ensure that they are not infected.
The Chinese estimates that the asymptomatic ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The incubation period (time between infection and symptoms) typically ranges between 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, uncertainty, the estimated number of COVID-19 patients who lose the initial kissing power is 30%, then decreased to 15%.
Details about how the disease spreads are still being studied.
COVID-19 spread is believed to occur primarily at the time of close contact and through the small droplets produced during cough, swelling, or speaking; close contact is contact within a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research found that uncovered cough could cause droplets to be pushed 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that last longer in the air and are produced when speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be produced when breathing, including when speaking, although the virus is not generally transmitted through the air.
Droplet can fall into the mouth or nose of a person who is near it or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make the respiratory secretion transition into aerosols and spread through the air.
The spread can also occur when a person touches the contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through feses, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government identified the possibility of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the first three days of the symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and at the further stage of the disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before the symptoms begin, which indicates the transmission may occur before the occurrence of significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of asymptomatic cases have been confirmed in the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by several countries during contact search research.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected up to three days on plastic (polipropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardus, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on moisture and temperature. Animal and other animals have been tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities suggest to wash hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that may have been touched by the infected person.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the cluster of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are associated with the coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, this virus can be destroyed if exposed to household soap, which solves its protective amplop. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the early SARS-CoV.
The virus has zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus was genetically classified with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (line of descent B) along with two gallons of sequence.
The virus has an equality of 96% at the entire genome level with other coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only a difference in one amino acid in certain parts of the genom sequence between the ginger virus and the human virus.
Until now, the overall genom comparison found that there was most 92% of the genetic material equality between the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the coronavirus is the intermediary inches of SARS-CoV-2.
Infections by viruses can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but confirmation at the end is done through a re-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the infected secretion or through CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with a lot of imaging features that matched pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtering or as the first line test in diagnosing COVID-19."
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was first distributed on January 17.
Testing using real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be done on breathing or blood samples.
The results are generally available in a few hours to a few days.
Generally, these tests are performed on nasopharing usps, but throat usps can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
By April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests proved accurate enough to approve its widespread use.
In the US, serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristics of radiographic and computed tomography imaging (CT) features in a symtomatic person include asymmetrical ground glass peripheral hazards and no pleura effects.
The Italian Radiological Society is preparing an international online database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Due to the intersection with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging has limited specificities in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared CT results with PCR and showed that although less specific to infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered as a filtering tool in the epidemic district.
Artificial intelligence-based neural convergence network has been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of this disease include keeping good personal hygiene in a comprehensive manner, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and wearing tissue at the time of cough or swelling as well as immediately throwing the tissue into the waste.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in a public place.
The government in various regions has restricted or urged to stop all non-essential travel to and from the countries and districts affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the level of public scale spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus has spread throughout the community, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected. Healthcare providers that deal with people who may be infected are advised to take standard preventive actions, contact preventive actions, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of local data from the mobile by the government for this purpose has triggered a privacy problem, with the release of statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed to be used voluntarily, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts work on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the user’s distance to other phones.
Furthermore, users will receive a message if they are close to someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19.Promoting misunderstandings about how to prevent infection; for example, swallowing the nose and swallowing with an ineffective medication.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC recommends that people frequently wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when their hands look dirty; before eating; as well as after swallowing their nose, cough, or swallowing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that damages its protective layer.
Additionally, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitation with alcohol content of at least 60% based on volume when soap and water are not available.
The WHO recommends that people do not touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be contaminated using a number of solutions (in one minute disinfected exposure to the surface of stainless steel), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochloride 0,1%, hydrogen peroxide 0,5%, and povidone-iodine 0,2–7,5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if there is a predictable or confirmed COVID case in public facilities, such as the office or the child’s residence, all areas such as the office, the bathroom, the public area, joint electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreen, keyboard, remote control, and the ATM machines used by the patient, should be infected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a tightened edge or use tissue when coughing or swelling, and then immediately remove the tissue.
A surgical mask is recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the respiratory droplets that are spread when speaking, swelling, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on the time and way of using the mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch the face with unclean hands, which is the main source of transmission."Masks are also recommended to be wearing by people who treat others who may suffer from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who treat COVID-19, although WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their face.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks to members of the community.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of nonmedical face masks made of fabric. China specifically recommends the use of once-used medical masks to healthy communities, especially when close (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends the use of surgical masks while using public transportation or living in a crowded place.
The Thai health office recommends people to make a fabric mask at home and wash it every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned the public from going to public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks when they went to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone who enters the toserba to wear a face mask.
Israel asks all its citizens to wear face masks when they are in public places.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, obliged rail and intercountry bus passengers to wear face masks by 1 April.
Panama requires the use of face masks every time outside the home, as well as recommends making home-made face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restrictions (also known as physical restrictions) are an action of infection handling intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
The method of social restriction includes quarantine; travel restrictions; as well as the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or expenditure centers.
People can apply social restriction methods by living at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded districts, using uncontact greetings, and keeping physical distance from others.
Currently, many governments impose or impose social restrictions in the districts affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations was rapidly reduced, starting from 250 people (if COVID-19 is unknown in a province) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Anxiety and people with basic medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension, and disrupted immune system that have a risk of serious diseases and higher complications recommended by CDC to as much as possible at home alone in the district that has an epidemic at the community level. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social restriction" to "physical restriction", to clarify that its objective is to reduce physical contact by continuing keeping social relationships, either virtually or from a distance.
The use of the term "social limitation" affects that people must isolate themselves fully socially and do not encourage people to stay in contact with others through alternative ways. Some authorities have issued guidelines for sexual health to be used during pandemic periods.
This recommendation includes an order to have sex only with people who live with you and have no viruses or viral symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people expected to be infected.
The health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments require or recommend self-carantine for the entire population living in the affected districts.
The most strict independent quarantine instructions are issued for people who include a high-risk group.
People who are likely to be exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently travelled to a country or territory with extensive spread of COVID-19 are advised to do an independent quarantine for 14 days from the time of possible last exposure.
Strategy in dealing with the epidemic is preventing or suppressing, as well as mitigating.
The prevention is carried out in the early stages of the epidemic and aims to track and isolate the infected people as well as to take other measures for the control of infection and vaccination aimed at preventing the spread of the disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, further efforts move to the mitigation level: these steps are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the healthcare system and the community.
Combination of blocking and mitigation actions can be done at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse pandemic by reducing the number of policy reproduction to less than 1.The part of the management of the epidemic of infectious diseases is seeking to lower the peak of the epidemic, which is known to hit the curve of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of breach on health services and provides more time for vaccination and treatment.
Non-pharmacy interventions to deal with the epidemic include individual preventive actions, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and independent quarantines; measures at the community level aimed at physical restrictions, such as shut down schools and canceling mass meeting events; community engagement to encourage reception and participation in such interventions; as well as measures at the environmental level, such as surface cleaning. Other drastic actions aimed at preventing the epidemic are carried out in China as the severity of the epidemic is increasingly manifested, such as arantining the entire city and enforcing strict travel prohibitions.
Other countries also implement a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass filtration and local quarantine, as well as issuing warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support to infected people who do independent quarantines and imposes a large penalty on those who fail to do so.
Simulations for the United Kingdom and the United States show that mitigation (later, but does not stop the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (return the growth of the epidemic) have a big challenge.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the peak of health care demand to 2/3 and deaths to half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelming health systems.
Suppression can be selected, but it must be preserved as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this first is achieved), because otherwise, the transmission will jump back quickly as soon as the suppression steps are relieved.
Long-term interventions to undermine pandemic have a social and economic impact.
There is no specific antivirus medication approved for COVID-19, but expansion efforts are underway, which includes existing drug testing.
Consuming flu drugs sold freely, drinking enough water, and rest can help relieve the symptoms.
Depending on the severity level, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and respiratory support may be required.
Using steroids can worsen the condition of the patient.
Some previously approved compounds for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also stated that some “traditional and household treatments” can relieve the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO says that improving capacity and adapting health services to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a fundamental step in responding to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the European Regional WHO Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to transfer resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible to cancel elective procedures, separate and isolate COVID-19 positive patients, as well as enhance the capacity of intensive care by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (which is called zero patient).
The first known new coronavirus case can be traced on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.

A number of provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been dismissed in connection with the handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, which is a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of the political committee in dealing with the epidemic in the province.
Some commentators believe that the move is intended to protect the Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from public anger related to the coronavirus epidemic.
Some Chinese offices, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected the previous recognition of the early coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan, and supported the conspiracy theory of COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
The U.S. government Donald Trump called the coronavirus a "China virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "Chinese closed action gives strength to the virus that is now transformed into a global pandemic."
The Daily Beast got a message from the U.S. government that describes the communication strategy and clearly comes from the National Peace Council, with the strategy quoted as "All about China.

The source accused Russia of carrying out "geopolitical and diplomatic" charitable attacks.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media report and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sends cargo aircraft containing medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that if U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials get the opportunity, they will also be able to respond if necessary."
NATO’s “Defender 2020” military training planned in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO war training since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.

On March 14, 2020, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to the world's leaders to ask for help and said that his country has difficulty fighting the epidemic due to the lack of access to the international market as a result of the U.S. sanctions against Iran. This has encouraged the U.S. to adopt a common social policy in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family holidays, and higher levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts assume that this could have a negative impact on the possibility of Donald Trump to be re-elected in the 2020 presidential election.

Wabah coronavirus is accused of a lack of supply, which arises from the increased use of equipment globally to combat epidemics, panic purchases, and factory and logistics operations disruptions.
The U.S. Food and Drug Authority has issued a warning about the lack of medications and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disturbances in suppliers.
Some districts also experience purchases due to panic that leads to the emptiness of the needs of trees, such as food, toilet tissue, and bottle water, which triggers a lack of supply.
In particular, the technology industry has warned about the delay in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for self-protection equipment increased 100 times.
This demand resulted in a price rise up to twenty times the normal price and triggered a four to six-month delay in the supply of medical goods.
This also causes a lack of self-protection tools around the world, and the WHO warns that this will harm health energy.
In Australia, the pandemic provides a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.

Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the province of Wuhan, as well as the high demand for food products, the two areas were avoided from the lack of food materials.
The actions of China and Italy in the fight against the accumulation and illegal trade of important products succeeded so that the expected acute food shortage will occur in Europe and North America can be avoided.
Northern Italy, with its massive agricultural production, has not experienced a significant decline, but prices can rise according to industry representatives.
The empty food rack was only temporarily found, even in the city of Wuhan, as the Chinese government office dismissed a suggestion of pig meat to ensure the nutritional well-being of the community.
Similar laws exist in Italy, which obliges food producers to keep recommendations for such emergency conditions.
The global economic decline has been perceived in China: according to a media report on March 16, the economy in China has been severely hit in the first two months of 2020 as a result of the government’s measures to resist the spread of the virus, and the retail sales of anthrop is 20.5%.
Since China land is a major economic and manufacturing center, the virus epidemic is considered to be a major threat of destabilization to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais from the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the market will continue to slide until there is a clearer picture of the potential final outcome.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the impact of epidemic economic decline on global growth could exceed the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
An estimate from members of the University of Washington in St. Louis said the epidemic affected more than $300 billion on the world supply chain, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of Land Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has a "cover-cover" after the oil prices have experienced a sharp decline as a result of the decline in demand from China.
On February 24, the global stock market fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside China's mainland.
On February 27, due to increased concerns about the coronavirus epidemic, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded the sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1.191 points, the largest one-day decline since the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
The three stock indices closed a week with a decrease of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the Chinese government’s credit level, but retained the Outlook Negative.
The shares dropped again due to concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest decline occurred on March 16.
Many people think the economic recession may happen.
The economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the central and state bank’s timely emergency measures.
Central banks react faster than they did at the time of the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel ban, public locations closure including tourist attractions, and government actions that restrict travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airlines Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the trail industry is at a level that has never been seen before.
Some railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincides with Chunyun, the main travel season associated with Imlek New Year's holidays.
A number of events involving many people were cancelled by the central and district governments, including the annual Imlek New Year Festival, and private enterprises also independently closed shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Imlek New Year events and tourist attractions are closed to prevent mass encounters, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and the traditional temple exhibitions.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, towns and provinces of China, authorities extended New Year's holidays to 10 February and ordered most of the jobs not to be reopened until that date.
These regions are the producer of 80% of the country’s PDB and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increased the suspension of infectious diseases to the highest level and announced an emergency state, closed schools until March, and canceled the New Year's celebration.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
North American and Middle East markets fell by 50-60%.
This also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
Operators of expenditure centers around the world are taking additional measures, such as improving sanitation, the installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of the buyer, and the cancellation of the event. According to estimates of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by a pandemic could cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase between 14 and 22 million people compared to the situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost jobs.
Most of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers are left home in the province of Hubei or are stuck in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lose their jobs and apply for government aid.
According to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus epidemic could lead to the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. the territorial quarantine in India caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (which are paid through daily wages) to be unemployed. A survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of households in Canada suffered a kind of loss of jobs. Nearly 900,000 workers lost jobs in Spain since they were carried out the territorial quarantine in the middle of March 2020.
During the second half of March, about 4 million French workers submitted temporary unemployment payments and 1 million British workers submitted a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany submitted a short-term government-subsidized work scheme for their employees, called Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and Britain.
Worldwide, the art show and cultural heritage sectors are greatly affected by the pandemic, which affects the operation of organizations and individuals, both employed and independent.
Organizations of the art and culture sector strive to highlight their mission (which is often funded by the public) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, safeguard the safety of employees and communities, and support artists if possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and at different levels, museums, libraries, exhibition sites, and other cultural institutions will be closed unlimited, with exhibitions, events, and exhibitions cancelled or delayed.
In response, intense efforts are spread to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The other harmful effects of this recent and very rapidly developing disease are the cancellation of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences, as well as fashion care.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebration in Rome, which fell in the last week of the Past Christian Revenge season, was cancelled.
Many churches organize Christians to stay at home and not attend the Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services through radio, live broadcast or television, while others offer drive-in or lantatur worship.
With the closure of the church and chapel by the Roman Catholic Church and the emptiness of the St. Peter's Square from Christians, other religious bodies also canceled the service and restricted public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gardens.
The Iranian Ministry of Health has announced the cancellation of Friday prayer in the districts affected by the epidemic and the places of worship are closed, while Saudi Arabia has banned foreign visitors and their inhabitants from entering holy places in Mekka and Medina.
This pandemic caused the most significant disturbance to the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events were cancelled or delayed, including UEFA Champions League 2019-2020, Premier League 2019-2020, UEFA Euro 2020, NBA season 2019-2020, and NHL season 2019-2020.
The International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will be "reprogrammed until after 2020, but will not be more than the summer of 2021."Around the world, casinos and other games are closed and live broadcasts of poker tournaments are delayed or cancelled.
This causes many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites report a significant increase in new registrations. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delayed or canceled concert tours.
Many big theatres like Broadway also delayed all the shows.
Artists explore a variety of ways to continue producing and sharing works through the internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live broadcast concerts or making a web-based "festival" for artists to show, disseminate, and publish their works.
Many coronavirus-themed internet meme are spread online with a lot of people switching to humor and distorting attention in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the spread of the COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against people of Chinese and Eastern Asia, as well as people from affected territories in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Fear, suspicion, and hostility incidents are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, Eastern Asia, North America, and Asia-Pacific regions.
A February report (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) records the racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world that Chinese are worthy of receiving the virus or receiving what they claim as an equal reward.
Some countries in Africa also experience an increased anti-China sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei discrimination due to their district origin.
There is already support for Chinese people, both online and luring, and for people in the districts affected by the virus.
Following the development of the epidemic to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a petition to ban Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan tag becomes a trend on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States increased levels of racist aggression and aggression.

Students from northeastern India, which border with China, and studying in major Indian cities have been to have experienced a coronavirus-related disorder.
Bharatiya Party President Janata State Unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that China has destroyed nature and "this is why God revenge them."
The statement was subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "misleading".In China, xenophobia and racism against non-China population broke out due to pandemic, with foreigners described as "strangers' waste" and targeted for "production".
Many newspapers using a paid blockage have removed it for part or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make scientific papers related to the epidemic available with open access.

Laboratory tests for respiratory disease coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and that detect the antibodies produced as a response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA alone.
These tests are used to confirm a new or still active infection.
Anticorps detection (serology) can be used for the diagnosis and surveillance of the population.
Anticorps tests show the number of people who have been infected, including people whose symptoms are too mild to be or who have no symptoms.
The accurate number of disease mortality and group immunity levels in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, until March 2020, no country has reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
Until March 23, no country tested more than 3% of its population, and there was a huge variation in the number of tests that have been done by the countries.
This variability may also significantly affect the number of fatalities, which is likely to be counted too high in some countries.
Using a real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be done on respiratory samples obtained by a variety of methods, including nasopharyngitis or sputum samples.
In general, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests performed on throat usps can only be reliable in the first week of the disease.
Therefore, the virus can disappear in the throat as long as it continues to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for the infected person tested in the second week, the sample material can be taken from the inner respiratory tract using an injection kateter or the material extracted through the cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time re-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The South Korean company Kogenebiotech will develop a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) clinical-level detection device on January 28, 2020.
The device finds the "E" gene owned by all the beta coronavirus, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group is one of the first enterprises to receive emergency use approval from China National Medical Products Administration for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tools.In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes the New Real-Time Coronavirus 2019 RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests on the old version of the test device gave unbearable results due to reactive errors, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that state laboratories and local laboratories were allowed to perform the tests.
The test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Authority on the basis of the Emergency Use Authority. The U.S. Commercial Laboratory began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on a national scale.
Likewise, Quest Diagnostics makes COVID-19 testing available nationally on 9 March 2020.
No quantity limits are announced; the collection and processing of the samples must be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Center of the Virology and Biotechnology Division VECTOR.
On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was to expand tests to detect COVID-19. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the FDA approval for tests that can be performed within 3.5 hours with high volume so that one machine can perform about 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA previously issued the same authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the US from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests that use isothermal nuclear acid amplification technology that is not PCR.
Because it does not require a series of temperature change cycles, this method can give a positive result in only five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipates to increase production to produce 50,000 tests per day. Tests using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind the new coronavirus protein nucleocapside (protein N) are being developed in Taiwan, hoping to deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a quick influenza test.
A library survey published in March 2020 concluded that “torax photos had a small diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT findings [computed tomography] may have already existed before the symptoms occur.”
Special features on CT include bilateral ground-glass danger with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distribution.
The domination of subpleura, crazy paving, and consolidation are formed as the disease develops.
In Wuhan, a study that compared PCR with CT at the point of origin of the current pandemic showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with a lot of imaging features intersecting with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtering or as the first line test in diagnosing COVID-19."In March 2020, CDC recommended PCR for early filtering.
The part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals for about 7 days after the symptoms occur, to determine immunity to the disease, and in population surveillance. Exam can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care test (PoCT).
High-performance automatic systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this examination, but its availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, one peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although a series of samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, a peripheral blood sample is generally used that is obtained through skin thickness.
Unlike the PCR method, extract measures are not required before the examination. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 bodies that provide notifications to the agency as necessary and therefore can now distribute their antibodies tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European approval for their test tools that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
Its test capacity up to several hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR examination against the virus RNA.
Antibodium is usually detected 14 days after the start of the infection. In early April, the UK found that no one of the antibodies it bought was good enough to use.
Hong Kong has prepared a scheme so that expected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient," they slide into it, send it back, and get the test results a few seconds later. NHS UK announces that NHS is pioneering the scheme of the expected case testing at home so that it eliminates the risk of the patient to infect another person if they come to the hospital or have to infect an ambulance if used. At the random test for the expected case COVID-19, a professional health personnel will take the sample using appropriate preventive measures.
On 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Germany said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in road care settings and 10,700 tests were performed in the previous week.
The cost is charged by the health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19th, landature tests were offered in several major cities.
By March 26, 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples were tested until and included week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6,9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested methods to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only further testing if combined samples were found positive.In Wuhan, an emergency detection laboratory of 2,000 square meters named "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin: 火 眼, or "Fire Eye" in Indonesian) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction supervised by the founder of BGI Wang Jian and took 5 days, modeling showed that cases in Hubei could be 47% higher and the related cost for quarantine handling could double if the test capacity was not available.
The Wuhan Laboratory was followed by the Huo-Yan Laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
By 4 March 2020, its total daily capacity is 50,000 tests per day. The open-source multipleks design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patients samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. This balanced design can be carried out in a small laboratory without the need for robotic liquid handling.
Until March, lack and insufficient quantity of reagen has been a barrier for mass testing in the European Union, the UK, and the United States.
For this reason, a number of researchers are trying to explore the sample preparation protocol involving sample warming at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genom for further testing. On March 31, the UAEly conducted more coronavirus tests per capita than any country, and ready to increase the test scale to reach the majority of the population.
This is achieved through a combination of landature testing and the purchase of mass-scale laboratory outcomes from Group 42 and BGI (based on the emergency detection laboratory "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside China.
A variety of test recipes that target various coronavirus genetic profile parts have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopts German prescriptions for the production of test tools sent to low-income countries without resources to develop themselves.
The German prescription was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, so it slowed the testing available in the U.S. At the beginning of the epidemic, China and the U.S. were troubled with the reliability of the test tools; the two countries and Australia were unable to provide enough test tools to meet the demand and recommendations of the test experts.
Instead, experts say that the extensive availability of testing in South Korea helps reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
Test capacity, mostly in the private sector labs, was developed in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for the improvement of the testing program as the best way to slow down the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests waiting for the launch in U.S. private laboratories, and the preparation of waste equipment as well as chemical reactors became impaired.
In March 2020, China accuracy problems on their test devices.
In the United States, the test tool developed by the CDC had a "defect"; the government then removed the bureaucracy obstacles that prevent the testing by the private. Spain bought the test tool from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explains that the incorrect results may be a result of failure in collecting samples or using the test tool correctly.
The Spanish ministry said they would pull out equipment that gave incorrect results, and replace it with other test tools provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test tools purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results.
Atheş Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test device purchased by Turkey from China had a "high level of error" and they didn't "use it".The UK bought 3.5 million test devices from China, but at the beginning of April 2020, they announced that the test device could not be used.
Tests, followed by the quarantine of the positive people tested and the tracking of the people who were in contact with the positive people of SARS-CoV-2, gave a positive final result.
Researchers working in the Italian town of Voi, the first death site caused by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two trials on the entire population of 3,400 people, with a distance of approximately 10 days.
Approximately half of the positively tested people have no symptoms, and all cases found are carantined.
With restrictions on the journey to this community, a new infection has been completed.
With aggressive contact tracking, entrance travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore develops much slower than other developed countries, although without extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore suggested residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools opened back in time after holidays on March 23.
Some other countries also deal with pandemics with aggressive contact tracking, entry travel restrictions, testing, and quarantines, but with non-aggressive territorial quarantines, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that the countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a much lower case fatality rate, probably because these countries were more able to detect people with mild symptoms or without symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following section, the column "% positive test results" is affected by the country's test policy.
The country that only tests people who are treated at the hospital will have a higher percentage of positive outcomes than the country that tests all its population, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors similar.
Hand washing, also referred to as hand hygiene, is a hand cleaning action aimed at removing dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands consistently with soap at certain “critical times” throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or selesma, if they don’t wash their hands before they touch the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., the mucous membrane).
Five critical seconds throughout the day that are very important to wash your hands with soap are: before and after urination, after cleaning the child's ass or replacing the puppy, before swallowing the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or birds.
If there is no water and soap, the hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing the hands:
Before, when, and after cooking.
Before and after the treatment.
After replacing the popcorn or cleaning the child who has just used the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, cough, or swelling.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal dirt.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before giving medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for people who deal with food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general society.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of flu, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the cause of infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
Reduce the mortality rate of babies at home.
Studies conducted in 2013 showed that improved handwashing practices could slightly increase the high growth of infants.
In developing countries, the number of child mortality due to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing moderate behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This moderate action can reduce the mortality rate caused by the disease to 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce cases of diarrhea to about a third; these interventions can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
Washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (ISPA), as subconscious behavior carried out at home, school, and community around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the number one cause of child death; the disease causes the deaths of about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause almost 3.5 million children’s deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet becomes an embedded habit can save more lives instead of vaccines or any medical action, as well as reduce deaths from diarrhea to almost half and deaths from acute respiratory tract infection to a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation actions as part of the water, sanitation, and hygiene program (WASH).
Washing hands also protects itself from impetigo that is transmitted through physical contact directly.
The small side effects of handwashing are the frequent handwashing that can cause skin damage due to skin drying.
A study conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that overwhelming handwashing could cause swelling and swelling skin conditions, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which are common among health workers.
Too often washing hands is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical seconds throughout the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission of the disease fecal-oral, i.e. before and after using the toilet, after cleaning the child’s ass, before swallowing the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or processing meat, fish, or raw birds.
Another important moment to apply the right handwashing technique to prevent the transmission of the disease is before and after the treatment of the wound; after swelling, cough, or blowing the nose; after touching animal dirt or treating animals; and after touching the dirt.
In many countries, the hand washing level with soap is still low.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practiced handwashing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest level with 97 percent; the United States almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest level with 23 percent. Now there are several behavioral change methodologies available to improve the adoption of behavioral habits of handwashing with soap at critical moments.
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of accurate scale action to support child health and education.
The administration of worm medications twice a year, along with the daily washing of hands with soap and the daily brushing of teeth with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
The program was also implemented in Indonesia.
The cleaning of microorganisms from the skin is strengthened by the addition of soap or detergent to the water.
The main work of soap and detergents is to reduce the barriers to the solution and increase the solvability.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser due to fat and protein, which is a component of organic dirt, is not easily soluble in water.
In this way, the cleaning of fat and protein is helped by sufficient water flow.
Solid soap, due to its properties that can be reused, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies that studied the bacterial transplantation from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transplantation was unlikely because the bacteria were melted with the mushroom.
Nevertheless, the CDC continues to say "fluid soap which is produced from the container without touching the hand is preferred."
Antibacterial soap is encouraged extensively to the conscious community of health.
Until now, there is no evidence that the recommended use of antiseptic or disinfectant is better for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains a common antibacterial agent such as triclosan, which has a wide list of resistant organism strains.
So, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soap, this soap may not be as effective as it is marketed.
In addition to surfacts and skin protectors, advanced formulations can contain acid (acetate acid, askorbatic acid, lactate acid) as a pH regulator, benzoate acid as an active antimicrobial, and further skin conditioner (crocodile tongue, vitamin, mentol, plant extract).A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon Community Health Faculty shows that common soap is equally effective as consumer-level antibacterial soap that contains triclosan in preventing diseases and cleansing bacteria from the hands.
Comfortable hot water to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at a body temperature (37 °C).
Soap hot water is more effective compared to soap cold water in removing natural oils that resist dirt and bacteria.
However, backward with the belief of many people, scientific studies show that the use of hot water has no effect in reducing the amount of microbes in the hands.
Hand sanitation or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents such as water-based alcohol sprayers (alcohol-based hand sprayers, antiseptic hand sprayers, or hand sanitation) began to be known.
Most of these hygienic agents are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol that are formulated together with the detergent substances such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into gel or joint humectan such as glycerin into liquid or butter so that it is easy to use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Additional hydrogen peroxide encer increases further antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitation containing at least 60-95% of alcohol is an effective bacterial killer.
Alcohol purification kills bacteria, bacteria resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungus.
Alcohol purification containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (reduction of log 3.5, similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of log 4 to 5) bacteria in the hands 1 minute after use.
Alcohol-based hand sanitation is almost entirely ineffective against the norovirus type (or Norwalk) virus, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Hand antiseptics or alcohol sprayers in sufficient amounts should be used to wet or cover both hands thoroughly.
The front and rear parts of the two hands, as well as the sides and ends of all the fingers are washed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, butter, or gel is dried.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than cleansing hands, especially when the hands look dirty.
Increased use of sanitary agents due to the ease of use and rapid murder activity against microorganisms; however, sanitary agents should not be used as a proper handwash replacement, unless soap and water are not available.
Use of alcohol-based hand sanitation can often cause dry skin, unless emolien and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emolien to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitation containing emolien causes irritation and drying of the skin much lower than soap and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in the alcohol handbush is rare.
Lower tendency causes disruptive contact dermatitis to become the attraction of this product compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-water agents do not clean the hands from organic materials, but only disinfect it.
For this reason, hand cleansers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogen is still in hand.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitation depends largely on the substance and its formulation, and according to history, the product has significantly performed worse than alcohol and alcohol spray.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effects reactions.
Many people in low-income communities are unable to buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
Soil or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One of the worries is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of the disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a desinfectant agent because, if contact with water, ash will form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The right handwashing techniques based on the recommendation of the U.S. Disease Control Center for the prevention of disease transmission include the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or cold water.
The flowing water is recommended because the injected bascoma may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not appear to be influential.
Wrap your hands by wraping it with a lot of soap, including your back, on your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more properly when using soap than when using water alone.
Drink for at least 20 seconds.
Brushing creates a friction, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and brushing longer removes more bacteria.
Wash smoothly under the flowing water.
Washing in the bascom can make the hands contaminated again.
Dry with a dry leaf or let it dry in the air.
The moist and moist hands are more easily reinfected. The often delayed areas are the gums, nails, areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and painted nails can store microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to keep the hands not dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate handwashing when water and/or soap are not available, for example, flowing water from jerigen or bottles hanged and folded and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations when water supply is limited (such as schools or rural districts in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tippy-tap", as well as other low-cost options.
Tipy cranes are a moderate technology that uses a bottle of water hanged with a thread, a cranes operated by the legs to throw a little water into the hand, and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a debate about the most effective forms of hand drying in the general toilet.
More and more research shows that the paper sheet is far cleaner than the electric hand dryer found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was carried out by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium Paper Lap Industry, to compare the level of hygiene of the paper Lap, hot air hand dryer, and more modern jet air hand dryer.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria found increased by an average of 194% in the fingers and 254% in the fingers.
Drying with a jet air dryer leads to an increase in the total number of bacteria by an average of 42% in the fingers and 15% in the fingers.
After washing and drying hands with paper sheets, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% in the fingers and 77% in the hands.The scientists also conducted tests to determine the potential of cross-contamination in other toilet users and toilet environments due to each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which emits air from the unit at a speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to explode microorganisms from the hands and units and is potentially polluting other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following changes in the number of bacteria are observed:
There are many hand dryers manufactured, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper sheets.
Washing hands using hand sanitation tissue is an alternative during travel if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitation should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing was required far after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the level of infection decreased with the use of the device.
Medical handwashing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using soap and water in a lot or gel to swallow and swallow each part of the hand.
The hands should be stretched with the fingers linked to each other.
If there is dirt under the nails, the hair brush can be used to remove it.
Because the bacteria can survive in the water in the hand, the hands should be smoothly washed and dried with a clean lap.
After drying, the paper sheet is used to kill the water clay (and open the outdoor if necessary).
This action prevents hand contamination from the surface.
The purpose of handwashing in health care arrangements is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and prevent their infection.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of handwashing remains at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses continuing to forget to wash hands before touching the patient to infect microorganisms.
One study showed that proper handwashing and other moderate procedures could reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infection to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper showing the standards of handwashing and handwashing in the healthcare sector.
The WHO hand hygiene concept guidelines can also be seen on its website for public comments.
The relevant survey was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial equipment can measure and validate hand hygiene if a demonstration of compliance with the rules is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Seconds" to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
prior to aseptic tasks, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (soap "medicine" or "antimicrobial") serves to kill the hand washing material.
To ‘smell’ your hands before surgery, it is necessary a brush that can be burned and shut off without touch, a chlorhexidine or iodine washer, a sterile plate to dry your hands after washing, and a sterile brush to smell as well as other sterile instruments to clean under your nails.
All jewelry should be released.
This procedure requires washing the hands and lower arms to the edge, usually for 2–6 minutes.
Long washing time (10 minutes) is not required.
When washing, water in the lower arm should be prevented so that it does not flow back to the hand.
After completing the washing of the hands, the hands are dried with sterile clothes and the surgical clothes are drawn.
To reduce the spread of bacteria, it is better to wash hands or use hand sanitation before and after treating the sick person.
For the treatment of staphylococcus infection at the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning comes from the first 20% of washing, and that the additional benefits obtained very little as the hand cleaning frequency increased above 35%.
Washing with regular soap results in more than three times the transmission of infectious diseases to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparison between washing hands with alcohol-based solution and washing hands with antibacterial soap with a median time of each 30 seconds indicates that alcohol-based hand washers reduce bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handbags to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and the spora Clostridium difficile from the hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in the health care board can involve education for staff about washing hands, improving the availability of alcohol-based handbags, and written and oral reminders to the staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective interventions in a variety of health care guidelines.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a basic cost-saving way to good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in residents, schools, and workplaces make the goal of achieving universal handwashing behavior a challenge.
For example, in most rural districts in Africa, handwashes near private toilet or public toilet are rare, although the option is available to make a cheap handwashes place.
Anyway, the low level of hand washing can also occur due to the habits that have been embedded and not due to the lack of soap or water.
Incentives and incentives for handwashing with soap can affect policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and produce long-term population behavior changes.
In order to operate effectively, monitoring and evaluation are required.
A systematic survey of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in improving handwashing in LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools was the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF that encouraged schools to take moderate and cheap steps to ensure students wash hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standard is achieved, the school can move from one star to the end to three stars.
Developing a handwashing place can be part of a handwashing promotion campaign that is carried out to reduce diseases and deaths of children.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness campaigns that try to the goal of behavioral change. As a result of the 2019-2020 corona virus pandemic, UNICEF encourages the use of handwashing emoji.
Some studies have studied the effectiveness of the cost of washing hands overall in developing countries in connection with the prevention of Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the measurement of the year lost as a result of pain.
One survey shows that encouraging handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-saving than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of washing hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable conditions, such as a newborn mother or wounded soldier at the hospital, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern care" in England.
At that time, many people still believe that the infection is caused by a bad smell called myasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, the epidemic transmitted through food and health care-related infections made the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raise awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, the poster "the right handwashing technique" is hanged next to the handwashing wastafel in the public toilet as well as in the office building and airport toilet in Germany.
The expression “washing hands from” means expressing a person’s refusal to be responsible for something or engage in something.
The expression comes from the Bible in the book of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on his decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a broadly used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands continuously to clean the imaginary spots; acts that show her guilt for the crime she did and for having convinced her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after remembering or considering unethical actions, people tend to wash hands more often and tend to more appreciate handwashing equipment.
Furthermore, the person who is allowed to wash the hands after such incubation has a smaller capacity to engage in compensation actions that are “cleaning”, such as becoming a volunteer.
Religion orders handwashing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is a ritual handwashing part in many religions, including the Bahá'í, Hindu, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Jewish, Lavabo in Christian, and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also orders handwashing for hygiene, especially after certain actions.
The Hindu, Jewish and Islamic religions are required to wash hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Jewish, and Islam requires handwashing before and after meals.
Workplace Dangerous Management for COVID-19
Workplace hazard management for COVID-19 is the implementation of work safety and health methodology for hazard management for the prevention of coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper risk management at work depends on the workplace and job tasks, which are based on the risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of each employee that may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Labour Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal employment contacts with the public and other colleagues; for this job, prevention measures are organized, which include washing hands, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and carry out cleaning and disinfecting work environments on a routine basis.
Exposure-risk jobs include jobs that require close or frequent contact with unknown persons or are expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected due to transmission in the ongoing community or international travel.
These groups include employees who have contacts with the general community such as in schools, working environments with high population density, and high volume retail rates.
Dangerous management for this group, in addition to the preventive measures of basic infection, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air scanning, protection against scratch, and provision of self-protection when encountered with COVID-19.
OSHA considers the health and body room exposed to a person known or expected to suffer COVID-19 high exposure risk, which increases to a very high exposure risk if the employee performs aerosol production procedure on, or takes or deals with a sample from, a person known or expected to suffer COVID-19.
Suitable danger handling for this employee includes technical handling, such as negative pressure ventilation space, and self-protection tools that suit the job tasks.
Wabah COVID-19 can have some effects on the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of sickness, need to take care of others, or because of fear of the possibility of exposure.
Trade patterns can change, whether in terms of the type of goods requested or the way of obtaining these goods (such as shopping outside busy hours, through delivery, or landature).
Finally, the delivery of goods from the highly affected geographical territory of COVID-19 can be interrupted. Preparation and plan for the suspension of infectious diseases can be used to drive protection measures.
The plan takes into account the risk levels associated with a variety of workplaces and job tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors arising from home and community arrangements, as well as risk factors for each employee, such as age or chronic medical condition.
The plan also describes the handling necessary to overcome such risks and an emergency plan for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Preparation and plan for the withdrawal of infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The purpose of epidemic delay includes reducing the transmission between staff, protecting people at a higher risk of bad health complications,ining business operations, and minimizing the negative effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is affected by the retaliation action taken.
Dangerous management hierarchy is a framework that is widely used in work safety and health to group dangerous management based on its effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be removed, the most effective handling is technical handling, followed by administrative distribution, and last self-protection tools.
Technical handling includes isolating employees from employment-related dangers without relying on employee behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to apply.
Administrative handling is a change in the work policy or procedure that requires the action of the employee or employer.
Self-protection tools (APDs) are considered less effective than technical and administrative handling, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of APDs should be selected on the basis of danger on the worker, properly installed as it occurs (e.g., respirator), consistently and correctly applied, checked, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and properly stored or removed to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Labour Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure risk jobs have minimal employment contacts with the public and other colleagues.
Policy prevention measures are recommended for all workplaces including frequently washing hands properly, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory ethics include covering cough and swelling, providing networks and waste containers, preparing work from a distance or work turn with time of arrival/return gradually, if necessary, informing employees not to use other people’s tools and equipment, and carrying out cleaning and disinfection of the work environment on a routine basis.
Fast identification and isolation of potentially transmitting individuals is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free from fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever remedies or other symptom-modifying drugs, and that the vacation policy is flexible so that it allows employees to stay at home to treat the sick family members, and that employees know this policy.
According to OSHA, exposure-risk jobs are currently involving jobs that require close or frequent contact within a distance of six feet (1,8 meters) with an unknown or expected person suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission in the community around the business location, or because someone newly travelled internationally to the location with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
This group includes employees who have contacts with the general community such as in schools, work environments with high density of population, and high volume ritel settings. Technical handling for this group and high-risk groups includes installing non-essential travel to the high-efficiency air filters, improving the level of ventilation, installing physical barriers such as plastic cylinders, and installing drive-thru or landature windows for customer service. Administrative handling for this group and high-risk groups includes encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, making work turns with time of arrival/return gradually, developing emergency communication plans to respond to worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's
Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If a person gets sick on the plane, proper controls to protect employees and other passengers include separating the sick person from the other person at a distance of 6 feet, indicating a cabin crew to take care of the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking him to cover the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or swelling.
Your cabin should wear medical gloves once-used when treating sick passengers or touching body fluids or surface that are potentially contaminated and possibly other self-protection devices if the sick passengers experience fever, constant cough, or breathing difficulties.
For commercial ships, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard handling includes delaying travel if sick, isolating, and informing the medical center on the ship immediately if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on the ship.
Despite the spread in the community, for schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if the infected person has ever been in the school building.
If there is a transmission in society at a minimum to moderate level, social restriction strategies can be applied, which includes: cancellation of field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, sound class, or eating in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between the tables, time of arrival and gradual return, limiting non-essential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high transmission in the local community, in addition to social restriction strategies, extension of school closure can be considered. For law enforcement officers who carry out daily routine activities, the direct health risk is considered low by the CDC.
The law enforcement officers who have to make contact with confirmed or expected COVID-19 persons are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate self-protection tools.
If close contact occurs during the arrest, the employee must clean and disinfect the bowl and task equipment before re-use using a spray or household cleaning sheet and follow the standard operating procedures to handle and remove container APDs as well as to handle and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers that health and body rooms are in the high or very high risk category.
High exposure risk jobs include the provision of health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation power exposed to patients known or expected COVID-19.
This work becomes very high exposure risk if the employee performs aerosol producer procedures on, or takes or deals with, patients known or expected COVID-19.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, several procedures and dental examinations, or the taking of invasive samples.
High exposure-risk body room work includes employees involved in preparing the bodies of a person known or expected COVID-19 case at the time of death; this job becomes extremely high exposure risk if the employee performs autopsy. Additional technical handling for this risk group includes isolation space for known or expected COVID-19, including when aerosol production procedure is carried out.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be suitable in some health care facilities and body rooms.
The samples should be treated with preventive measures of Biological Safety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come to be separated into different waiting rooms based on whether they are expected COVID-19. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends a respirator for people who work at a distance of 6 feet from patients who are known or expected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and people who perform aerosol production procedure.
In the United States, the NIOSH approved N95 or better facial filter cover respirator should be used in the context of a written and comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes adequacy tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirator can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend completely closed clothes or coverall because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
WHO only recommends surgical masks for screening officers at the entrance point.
For people taking breathing samples, treating, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or face shields, clothes, and gloves.
If aerosol production procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with the respirator N95 or FFP2.
Given that the supply of APD is not sufficient around the world, the WHO recommends minimizing the APD needs through remote medical services, physical limiters such as a window-shutdown, with only the people involved in direct treatment can enter the room containing COVID-19, using only the APD required for a particular task, continuing to use the same respirator without leaving it while treating many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks for people without symptoms.

We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear the global human bonds and responsibilities we have to each other.
We have never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and development of the global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and care that we have witnessed among all our colleagues through emails, calls, and conversations is an incredible validation of the presence of extraordinary humans, whom we are lucky enough, to work with them.
I am so grateful and proud that I can call you all of my friends.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how meaningful it is for the world today to have access to Wikipedia and how it is a strong symbol for this important resource to remain available online to everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you make sure this site remains running, help pay our colleagues, or help maintain the peace of our community.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially right now.
This is a moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will make a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adaptation to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team-c met yesterday to discuss our approach and schedules for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we think is the correct response to the challenges we face and the best way to maintain the organization’s survival throughout this time.
We strongly want to get rid of the pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to reduce your work schedule, it’s okay.
For all employees, contractors, and contractual employees:
Our daily work expectation is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notification.
We do not set holidays, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission requires you.
However, the world is unpredictable at this moment, and whether you need to take care of loved ones, shopping for trees, or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not monitor your working hours.
If you are sick, don’t work.
This should not be said, but we say it.
Disease leave or PTO is not required, just tell your manager and help your team review the calendar and schedule to ensure the key fields of work can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed positive with COVID-19, please tell Bryan in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the right attention from management).
Members whose wages are based on hours will be paid in full.
We have said it, and said it again, to respect our commitment to colleagues contractors and clock-based staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours when the conditions are normal.
This includes if you are sick and can’t work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to transmit stress to the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in such times.
Again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to be expected and can take the appropriate action.
Some work is considered essential.
There are a few jobs to continue.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Peace, as well as the Funding Team, among others, do important jobs that may require additional support.
We will start the process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and move our focus to support the essential things for our mission.
There is a lot to do for us all, we will only focus fully on the most essential projects.
Delaying this moment will not be anything for the future.
We don’t plan to “work the leaves pursue the missing” after this pandemic has passed.
You won’t be expected to work hard to meet the unrealistic momentum.
We realize that the situation changes and will be able to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about the Annual Planning?
To adapt to the new statements and daily working hours expectations, we intend to adapt the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to make budgets so that employees can prioritize important jobs, self-care, and care of loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work with less schedules for the next few weeks.
The extension of this timeline significantly reduces the workload and current planning pressure throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposals to the Council next week and will update the delegations and teams on the next step as soon as we get the confirmation.
Thank the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, display, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, due to great concerns, we hire an antivirus cleaning crew to infect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use a hospital-class antivirus fluid to infect every surface, lobby, and all lifts that reach our floor.
The building applies its own safety assurance protocol using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We feel happy that the office will be ready to wear when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol to us and all staff members based in DC.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a full-remote workplace, in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues based in NYC know, we are also discussing renting a location in Brooklyn.
The discussion is ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work from a distance for the first time.
Our colleagues who have long worked on a distance realize that it may need adaptation and they want to give you advice:
The maximum duration is one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it into a few days.
Defining closely clearly, make a agenda, and send the reading material before.
Make the video a default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Show the leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and record the speaker list, and someone to help make close records (or do collaborative records).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well-being compensation to buy small food.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about shared jobs
SDM Operating Team is looking for webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support improved employment distributed throughout the Foundation.
Last week we asked all the recipients of community grants to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We inform them that we understand our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make them unable to complete agreed subsidy activities and that no one will be dismissed for having to delay or modify those targets.
The next week we will continue with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
In general, the feelings of the entire global community appear to be a sadness due to this disruption, but at the same time relieved by the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT is trying to complete a page in Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We will send an invitation to your calendar for the next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take time to connect with each other.
We are both in this situation and we want to help each other.
Meanwhile, you can continue to get information from this email and all other essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all the information is in one place.
We are also able to maintain routine communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, event, main workflow, or difficulties about coverage, or anything else that may require help, don’t hesitate to inform and work with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and become a connector according to the need.
If you have a confidential or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Global Operations Director of SDM International.
No one of these changes is seen as the abandonment of our job and duty.
Instead, this change is a recognition that, at this moment, our work and duties may need to be adapted in a way that we have never done before.
These changes are the steps we believe it is important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the necessary support of our movement, and provide the world of services that they trust.
The work we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and create space for important jobs coming in a few weeks and a few months to come.
We need you all to create it, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work as well as when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other Leadership Team members (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The angiotensin modifier enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer cell surface (cell membrane) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has the opposite activity of the angiotensin conversion enzyme (ACE), reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target to treat cardiovascular diseases.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 is a metaloenzyme containing zinc located on the surface of endotel and other cells.
Protein ACE2 has the M2 terminal-N peptidase domain and the renal amino acid collectrin terminal-C transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single type I release membrane protein, with an enzymatically active domain exposed to the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracellum domain is separated from the transmembran domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the produced soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually secreted into the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membranes, especially the type II alveolar lungs cells, the intestinal enterosites, the endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, and the pulmonary muscle cells of the arteries in most organs.
The expression of mRNA ACE2 is also found in the cortex of the brain, the striatum, the hypothalamus, and the stroke.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancer.
ACE divides the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the carboxyl terminal phenylalanine amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the traffic of the transporter membrane of neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembran protein, ACE2 serves as the main entrance point to the cell for several coronavirus, which includes HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the bonding of S1 protein on spike or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the ACE2 enzymatic domain on the cell surface leads to endositosis and the translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosomes located within the cell.
The process of entry of the virus also requires the priming of protein S by the smooth intestinal protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently being studied as a potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothesized that a decrease in the ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many community professionals and regulatory bodies recommend continuing ACE and ARB standard inhibitors therapy.
A systematic and meta-analysis survey, published on July 11, 2012, found that “the use of ACE inhibitors resulted in a significant 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to control.”
Moreover, "the use of ACE inhibitors also reduces the risk of pneumonia in patients with a higher risk of pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the result is less strong than the overall risk of pneumonia.”
ACE2 human recombination (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute lungs injury, and appears to improve the hemodynamics of the lungs and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory disorder triggered by lipoplisaccharides.
Half-time rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours with a 30-minute work time in addition to the length of the effect (duration) 24 hours.
Some findings show that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for patients with intolerance to the classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in the disease with angiotensin II in increased blood circulation.
COVID-19 is a mobile software application designed to help contact tracking to postpone the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, a process of identifying people ("contact") who may have been in contact with the infected person.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which get official government support in several provinces and jurisdictions.
Some frameworks for developing contact tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy issues are questioned, related to systems based on the tracking of the geographical location of the user of the application.
An alternative that is not too disturbing privacy includes the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate functionality to support Bluetooth-based apps directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has spread an application that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19.
The app is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, the app is called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track the exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to healthcare authorities.
The application is developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
By April 14, 2020, the app will still wait for the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that the contact tracking application is in an advanced stage of expansion and will be available for dissemination within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether Singapore application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for diagnosed COVID-19 patients living in Moscow; the application is designed to ensure that they don’t leave the home.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Peace Engineering at the University of Cambridge, mentioned a number of practical problems that may occur on application-based systems, which include false positive and the possibility of lack of efficiency if the data taken by the application is limited to a small portion of the population alone.
To tackle concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple has set a limit on the type of organization that can add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store, i.e. limiting only to “official” or well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon implement similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, in particular whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped after the threat passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The organization sets out eight conditions for the government project:
the surveillance must be "in accordance with the law, necessary, and proportional";
extension of monitoring and surveillance should have a sunset clause;
the use of data should be limited for the purposes of COVID-19;
security and anonymity of data must be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
any data sharing with third parties must be defined in the law;
protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Participation means all the "relevant interests" required, which includes public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Without Borders) (RSF) also issued a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to solve the problem of continuous surveillance by removing tracking mechanisms from the device’s operating system after no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based locations tracking, and not applications, thus eliminating the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have potential significant privacy problems.
However, not all systems with a central server need access to personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use the central server only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, non-app-based systems are used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to produce notifications through text messages to persons potentially infected.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes the information of the location available to the public, which is permitted with the existence of extensive changes in the information privacy law after the spread of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries like Germany consider using a centralized system at the same time a system that protects privacy.
Until April 6, 2020, the details were not published.
Contact tracking that protects privacy is a well-established concept, with a large number of research literature starting at least in 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts work on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the user’s proximity with other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, and not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Environment Tracking that Protect Decentralized Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Interim Contact Number (TCN, previously referred to as Contact Event Number, CEN), Protocol and Privacy Sensitive Mechanisms for Cellular Contact Tracking (PACT), etc.
In this protocol, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all evacuation occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab develops SafePaths, a platform to use techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location or intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on the research from the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020.Another similar feature is SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology and was initially also founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without damaging the privacy of such data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was established by groups that have a approach that is basically the same and is a multi-tamped protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is the key aspect of achieving broad acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it has made the BlueTrace protocol used by its government’s official application open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies operating Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claim to protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also publish the specifications of the core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be launched in three stages:
the launch of the tool to enable the government to make the official coronavirus tracking application that protects privacy
The integration of this feature directly to iOS and Android Google and Apple plans to solve the problem of data collection and continuous surveillance by initially distributing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way after the threat passed.
The drug response (also referred to as the provision of a new purpose, a new profile, or a new task on a drug or a therapeutic transition) is the use of a drug that has been approved for a new treatment purpose, i.e. for a disease or medical condition that is different from the initial purpose of the drug development.
This path is a path of scientific research that is currently underway to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research directions include the expansion of the COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be the target of the drug, each protein has several ligan bonding sites.
Analysis of these ligan bonding sites can be the basis of an effective anti-virus drug expansion project against COVID-19 protein.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteases, RNA-dependent polymerase, heliase, S protein, and ADP ribofosfatase.
Hussein A, et al studied a number of candidate compounds that were later optimized and analyzed the similarity of the cornea with the drug that has been approved and had the highest similarity to accelerate the expansion of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potent drug in its practical studies to be recommended in the design of the clinical study.
Chlorokuin is an anti-malaria drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.

The New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the test of chlorokuin and hydrochlorokuin in New York will begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydrochlorokuin sulfate and chlorokuin phosphate based on the Emergency Use Authorization (USA).
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized based on the USA only as a experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxyclorokuin for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" was not specified.
The doctors said they used the drug when "there's no other choice."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study of the use of chlorokuin combined with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
The major studies are ongoing at Duke University and University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test of peace and continuity of preventive use of hydroxyclorokuin.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was proven "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were tested negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not take the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the total patients were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacy Agency reminds the public that the evidence available to support the drug is not much and too early.
On April 2, Germany announced that it will buy the drug from Japan for preparation and use the military to send the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in cases of severe diseases with a multiplied virus.
This drug may not be safe if used by a pregnant woman or a person trying to get pregnant.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirus, concluded that “there is no observed benefit.”
The drug is designed to prevent the replication of HIV by binding protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a compound that will be linked to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is a criticism in the scientific community about the guidance of resources for the reposition of the drug developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Then, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had antivirus activity in vitro against several filo-, pneumo-, paramikso-, and coronavirus.
One problem with antivirus treatment is the occurrence of resistance through mutations that can cause disease and more severe transmission.
There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials carried out by the University Hospital of Cleveland, namely one for people with moderate illness and another for people with severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials for intraveneal vitamin C for people treated in a residential and severe COVID-19 disease, namely two controlled plasebo (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The State of New York starts the test for the antibiotic Azitromycin on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, a corticosteroid inhalation for asthma, for the treatment of new pre-symptomatic coronavirus infection patients.

Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not use effective contraceptive methods are not eligible.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients so encouraging the Italian Medicine Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multi-centered study of 300 patients who studied the use of sodium enoksaparin in the preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, many scientific attention is focused on giving new treatment targets to approved and developed antiviral drugs for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to China's 7th edition guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to China's 7th edition guidelines
Some identified antibiotics are potentially a drug that may be given a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): Approved by China.
In addition, the trials were also conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed the clinical trials, a lot of efforts are being made to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to the WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the caused virus of the disease, will not be available within less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in the Phase I peace study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
Large vaccines will spread around the world by 2020, resulting in huge investments and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use the published genom to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative gave a statement in April that what should be observed in the development of vaccines is the speed, production capacity, spread at the required scale, as well as global access.
In April, CEPI officials that 10 different technology platforms are in research and development in early 2020 to create effective vaccines against COVID-19.
The main platform targets that advanced to Phase I Peace Studies, include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Fase I developers and vaccine candidates: Modern, mRNA-1273)
Vector virus (Fase I developers and vaccine candidates: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vectors)
As by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of expansion, with 78 confirmed as an active project (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (thanks being in planning or in planning).
Phase I-II testing performs early safety and immunogenicity tests, usually performed randomly, placebo-controlled, and in some locations, while determining the more accurate effective dose.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including control groups, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while monitoring the side effects on the optimal dose.
Of 79 active vaccine candidates being developed (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 of them were not in human evaluation (now in "praklinic" research).
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they are investigating the potential molecular detector vaccine that will genetically modify viral protein to stimulate immune reaction.

On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, the expansion of coronavirus-like particles with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with human testing planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian that U.S. President Donald Trump has offered "a huge amount of money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company, BioNTech, to jointly develop the mRNA-based vaccine.
Currently, the mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in a pre-clinical trial with a clinical trial is expected to start in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that they will get the results of the pre-clinical trials in April 2020 and vaccine candidates at the final stage can begin to be tested on humans in the autumn.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Coalition for Epidemial Preparation Innovation (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in the COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Win, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with the total CEPI investment in the expansion of the COVID-19 vaccine reached $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the expansion of the COVID-19 vaccine are Modern, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford, and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health office announced that scientists had started testing six candidates for vaccines on animals.
Researchers from the Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing an RNA vaccine that can self-amplify for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days after receiving a sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 medical discontinuation research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and Saskatchewan University initiative.
In almost the same time, the Canadian government announced a fund of $192 million to expand the vaccine COVID-19, with plans to establish a national vaccine bank containing a number of new vaccines that can be used if another coronavirus epidemic occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Faculty of Medicine PittCoVacc, a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, test on mice; they stated that “the MNA that gives the sub-unity S1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine triggers an antigen-specific response [on mice] that begins to be visible 2 weeks after vaccination.”
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo announced the DNA-based vaccine candidate design as a potential nasal spray.
By using bacteriophagus, DNA is designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless viral-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities gather resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, which are also called non-specific effects.
This means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
A further tracking trial in Australia sought to follow 4,170 health officers.
There is a possibility that the vaccine in the expansion will not be safe or effective.
Early research to evaluate the prevalence of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, showed the need for preventive measures to biological safety level 3 in dealing with living viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
By 2020, no drug or vaccine for SARS is proven safe and effective in humans.
According to the research paper published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and expansion of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS becomes prevalent, existing SARS studies are believed to be a useful template for developing vaccine and therapy against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that completed phase I clinical trials on humans, and three other vaccines are in process, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two vector adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vector-MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts combine the conspiracy theory that claims the virus behind COVID-19 has been known before and that the vaccine has been available.
Patents quoted by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequence and vaccines for other coronavirus galur, such as the SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious disease caused by coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing discomfort.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of kissing power, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases lead to mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and failure of the membrane.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been healed. The virus mainly spreads among humans when it occurs in close contact, often through sputum or small droplets produced through cough, sputum, or moment of speech.
Although produced at the moment of breathing, droplet usually falls to the ground or to the surface and is not infectious to a distance.
People can also be infected by touching the contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can last up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after the symptoms occur, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and after the subsequent stage of the disease. The standard diagnosis method is with a real-time re-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on nasopharyngitis.
The use of the mask is recommended for people suspected to be infected with the virus and the person who treats it.
Recommendations on the use of masks by the general public are different; some authorities recommend not using masks, some recommend their use, and others require their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antivirus treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may have symptoms or have symptoms such as flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathing failure.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or swelling in the ongoing chest, confusion, sudden awakening, and face or lips blurry; immediate medical removal is recommended if these symptoms appear.
Symptoms of upper respiration, such as swelling, swelling, or throat pain can be found, but more rarely occur.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China were initially only with clinical images of chest and palpitation.
In some people, the disease can develop into pneumonia, failure of the spinal organs, and death.
This time is called inkubation.
The incubation time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. reports show that not all people infected have symptoms.
The role of these non-symptomatic carriers in transmission is not fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
Currently, the percentage of infected people who don’t show symptoms is unknown and is under investigation, with the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remain without symptoms during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include cases without symptoms in its daily cases on April 1; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show any symptoms at the time of the test.
Sputum and slurry can carry viral load on a large scale.
Speaking loudly releases more scratches or droplet than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered cough could cause droplets to be pushed up to a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is usually not transmitted through the air, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences shows that bioaerosol transmission may occur and air collectors placed in the corridor outside the room of people produce positive samples for the virus’s RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make the respiratory secretion transformed into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through the feses, this risk is believed to be low. The most infectious virus when people are signs; although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
Specifically, it was found that the virus can be detected for one day on carton/cardus, up to three days on plastic (polipropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on moisture and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products dissolve the virus-protected fat layer, deactivate the virus, as well as release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (chirurgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, slurry samples were taken in a median of two days after the treatment of residence began.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest virus load, and the sixth patient showed the highest virus load on the second day of the test.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the cluster of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist on coronavirus in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which damages its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is close to the first SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus reaches the living cells through the angiotensin 2-modifier enzyme (ACE2), which is most abundant in the alveolar cells type II of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike or tune" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the living cell.
Acute heart injuries were found in 12% of infected people who were treated in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe diseases.
The level of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the presence of systemic inflammatory responses and disorders of the immune system during the development of the disease, but acute myocardial injuries may also be associated with the ACE2 receptor in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
High incidents of thrombosis (31%) and venous thrombembolism (25%) were found in patients with COVID-19 infection in ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis. Autopsy in people who died because of COVID-19 found diffus alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF secretion T cells have been shown to be correlated with the recruitment of monocytes secreting inflammatory IL-6 and severe lung pathologies in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphostic infiltrations have also been in autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is a real-time re-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
These tests are usually performed on breathing samples obtained through nasopharing usps; however, nasal usps or sputum samples can also be used.
In general, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but it requires two blood samples taken at a distance of two weeks until the results have a small time value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR) independently to detect infection by the virus.
On April 4, 2020, the antibodies test (which can detect an active infection and if a person has previously been infected) is in expansion, but not much used.
Chinese experience with the test shows its accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by the Zhongnan University Hospital of Wuhan suggested methods to detect infection based on clinical images and epidemiological risks.
Multilobar bilateral ground-glass opasity with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution is widely found at the beginning of the infection.
Subpleural domination, crazy paving (lobular septum thickness with varied alveolar filling), and consolidation can appear with the development of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of autopsy are:
Makroscopy: pleurism, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of pneumonia virus severity can be observed:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumosite hyperplasia, large atypical pneumosite, interstitial inflammation with lymphosite infiltration, and the formation of many genetic cells
Heavy pneumonia: diffus alveolar damage (DAD) with diffus alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory failure syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the healing stage: exudate arrangement in the alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the possibility of infection include stable at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or swallowing and recommends the use of the inside part of the coat if the tissue is not available.
Suitable hand hygiene after cough or swelling is recommended.
CDC recommends the use of facial covering from clothes in public places, partially to limit the transmission by people without symptoms. Social restriction strategies aim to reduce the contact of infected people with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public places.
The limitation guidelines also include people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
Since the expected vaccine is not yet available until the beginning of 2021, the main part in dealing with COVID-19 is attempting to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as the "riding curve".
CDC also recommends that people frequently wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when their hands look dirty, before eating, as well as after swallowing their nose, cough, or swallowing.
Moreover, the CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitation that contains at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand sanitation is not available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not an active substance for hand antiseptics".
Glycerol is added as humectan.
People are treated with support treatment, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends people who suspect they carry the virus to wear a moderate face mask.
Extrakorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still considered.
Self hygiene and lifestyle as well as healthy eating patterns are recommended to enhance immunity.
Supporting treatment may be useful in people with mild symptoms at the early stages of infection. WHO and China National Health Commission have published recommendations to deal with hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Intense therapists and lungists in the U.S. have prepared treatment recommendations from various institutions into a free resource, IBCC.
By April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical energies more recommend parasetamol (asetaminofen) than ibuprofen for first line use.
Preventive measures should be taken in order to minimize the risk of viral transmission, especially in health care conditions when performing procedures that may produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health care providers treating COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in the tuberculosis infection isolation space (AIIR) in addition to using standard preventive measures, contact preventive measures, and tuberculosis preventive measures. the CDC describes the guidelines for the use of self-protection devices (APDs) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment are: APD clothes, respirator or face mask, eye protector, and medical gloves. If available, the respirator (not face mask) is better.
Respirator N95 was approved for industry regulations, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used on the basis of the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Respirator N95 is designed to protect from air-introduced particles such as dust, but the effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use not mentioned on the label.
If the mask is not available, the CDC recommends using a face protector or, as a last effort, a home-made mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not too heavy to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are very heavy.
Types of respiratory support for people with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 are being actively studied for people treated in the home, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high-flow nasal canal or bipositive air vessel pressure.
It is unknown whether either of these two methods produces the same benefits for people with critical illness.
Some doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, as this technique restricts the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high-flow nasal canal. Heavy cases occur more often in lansia (persons over the age of 60, and especially people over the age of 80).
Many developed countries do not have sufficient hospital beds per capita, which restricts the capacity of the health system to deal with the sudden rise of the number of COVID-19 cases that are quite severe so that it requires hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% entered intensive treatment units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized eventually enter ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory failure syndrome (ARDS) occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators capable of performing high pressure and PEEP control mode are required to maximize the supply of oxygen while at the same time minimizing the risk of lung injury and pneumotoraks related to the ventilator.
High PEEPs may not be available on the old ventilator.
Research on the potential treatment begins in January 2020 and some antivirus drugs are under clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the expansion of the new drug may take time until 2021, some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antivirus drugs can be tried in people with severe diseases.
The WHO recommended volunteers participate in the testing of the effectiveness and peace of potential treatment. The FDA has given temporary authorization for plasma convergence as a experimental treatment in cases of a person’s life is very or immediately threatened.
The convalent plasma has not undergone the necessary clinical trials to prove its peace and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the epidemic of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is capable of detecting 'blind contacts' using surveillance data so that it can detect the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends independent quarantine, but also informs the local health officials. Data analysis on mobile data, face identification technology, mobile tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track the infected people and people who interact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security bodies to track the mobile data of people allegedly infected with coronavirus.
The measure is taken to carry out the quarantine and protect people who may be in contact with infected citizens.
Moreover, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom will distribute an aggregate of telephone location data to the German federal government body, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia uses face identification technology to detect quarantine breachers.
Italian regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said it was informed by mobile operators that “40% of citizens are still moving.”
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor who said, "Augmented social isolation, loneliness, health emergencies, stress, and economic decline are a perfect storm that is harmful to mental health and community well-being."
This disease can last mildly with little or without symptoms, which resembles other general upper respiratory diseases, such as colds.
Light cases usually heal within two weeks, while those who suffer from severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still less.
In the most severe people affected, COVID-19 can quickly develop into acute respiratory failure syndrome (ARDS) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or failure of the spine.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clot, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood accumulation disorders, in particular increased protrombin time, were observed in 6% of COVID-19 patients who were treated inhabited, while kidney disorders were observed in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with the image of COVID-19 showed an increase in the liver enzyme (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in residential treatment.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had an average seven-day time between residence treatment and death.
In a study that studied early cases, the median time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Postmortem pulmonary sample histopatological examinations show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromicsoid exudate in both lungs.
The cytopathic changes of the virus are observed in pneumosites.
The pulmonary image is similar to the acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS).
At 11.8% of deaths by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was observed, with increased troponin levels or heart stops.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of the people treated inhabitants have a native condition. The availability of medical and social-economic resources of a district can also affect mortality.
The estimates of mortality from conditions vary due to the differences in the region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
A lack of light counting of cases can cause the number of deaths to be counted too high.
However, the fact that deaths are a result of cases that occur in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is counted too low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die than non-smokers.
The authorities of the Hong Kong Hospital found a decrease in lung capacity of 20% to 30% in some people recovering from the disease, and lung screening indicated organ damage.
It can also cause post-healing-intensive syndrome after healing.
Until March 2020, it is unknown if the previous infection provides effective and long-term immunity in people healed from the disease.
Immunity may be obtained, if observed other coronavirus behaviors, but there has been cases of COVID-19 healing followed by a coronavirus positive test a few days later.
This case is believed to be a worse residue infection, not a reinfection.
This virus is supposed to be natural and comes from animals, through a spread infection.
The origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection is almost entirely driven by the transmission from humans to humans.
A study of 41 first confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of symptoms occurring was 1 December 2019.
The official publication of the WHO the earliest signs of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary depending on the region and over time, as well as influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, time since the first epidemic, and the character of the population such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO set the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 deaths without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the mortality rate for cases globally was 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) by 17 April 2020.
Other measurements include the case fatality number (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who died from a certain disease, and the infection fatality number (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a certain disease.
These statistics are not timely bound and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all people infected make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicentrum of the epidemic in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village containing 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1,7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through the Carnival festival, which spread among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and the possibility that not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Moreover, the German health system is not overcome.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0,004% of the population) were infirmed dead due to COVID-19.
The effects of pandemic and its mortality rates are different for men and women.
The mortality rate is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with the risk difference between new men and women not visible at the age of 90.
In China, the death toll for men was 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The certain reason for these gender-based differences is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men who have complicated conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the people infected are men and 72% of the people dying due to COVID-19 are men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government did not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infection.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of female sex health workers is higher, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is an abbreviation for corona, VI for viruses, D for diseases, and 19 for the moment the first epidemic was identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), species of animals, or a group of people, in accordance with the international recommendations for names aimed at preventing stigmatisation. The virus that caused COVID-19 was named coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 responsible virus” in public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease are commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory diseases 2019-nCov as a temporary name for viruses and diseases in accordance with the 2015 guidelines that encourage not to use location names in the name of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limitation of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal dust and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital hardly needs a carpenter, and the supplier is unable to provide in the required time scale, a local enterprise reverses and printes the 100 carpets required in the night.
After the beginning of the COVID-19, the theory of conspiracy, misinformation, and disinformation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
People seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
Studies failed to find evidence of the replication of the virus on pigs, bees, and chickens.
There are no medications or vaccines approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs COVID-19 is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a “SOLIDARITY Trial” to study the effects of the treatment of four existing antivirus compounds with the most promising progress.
The vaccine is not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both used ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccine strategies being studied.
First, the researchers aim to make a complete viral vaccine.
The use of these viruses, whether inactive or dead viruses, aims to rapidly trigger the human body’s immune response to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the subunity vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to a particular subunity of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, the study focused on the S-spike protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique for making vaccines).
The experimental vaccine made with these strategies should be tested to find out its peace and efficiency. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine begins with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains unharmful genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Increased dependence on antibodies has been suggested as a potential challenge for the expansion of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials that are ongoing in April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxyclorokuin or chlorokuin.
New-targeted antivirus drugs form the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III trials on remdesivir in some countries with a reporting time limit at the end of April.
By April 2020, a dynamic survey of clinical expansion for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drugs is already available.Some existing antivirus drugs are being evaluated for COVID-19, which include remdesivir, chlorokuin and hydroxyclorokuin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with beta interferon.
In March 2020, there are temporary evidence for the proliferation of remdesivir.
Clinical improvements are observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China, and Italy. Chlorokuin, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with initial results.
However, there is a call for a thorough investigation of the investigation.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorokuin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite recommending a daily dose of one gram, noted that the double dose is very dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxyclorokuin and chlorokuin on the policy of doctors treating COVID-19.China's 7th edition also included interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Early data show that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanids have been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing SARS-CoV-2 slowdown in low concentrations.Studies show that early priming of tonic protein by serin transmembran protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies on chlorokuin and hydroxyclorokuin with or without azithromycin have great limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Complications of the cytokine storm can occur at the COVID-19 level of weight.
There is evidence that hydroxyclorokuin may have antisithokine properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the medical guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study is completed.
The drug is undergoing phase 2 non-track tests at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe illness.
Combined with a serum feritin blood test to identify the cytokine storm, the drug is intended to fight the cytokine storm, which is supposed to be the cause of death in some people affected.
In 2017, the interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA on the basis of a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroid cytokine refractor release syndrome that was induced by a different cause, namely CAR T cell therapy.
Until now, there is no random and controlled evidence that shows that tocilizumab is a substantial treatment for CRS.
The transfer of cleansed and attached antibodies produced by the system of people who have been healed from COVID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a non-vaccin passive immunization method.
This strategy is tried for SARS with non-conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected work mechanism for passive antibodies therapy that can mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cell cytotoxicity that depends on antibodies and/or fagositosis, are also possible.
Other forms of passive antibodies therapy, for example, using produced monoclonal antibodies, are in expansion.
The production of the convalence serum, which forms a liquid part of the healed patient’s blood and contains specific antibodies against this virus, can be enhanced for faster use.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndrome
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Central Hospital, who was later infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
