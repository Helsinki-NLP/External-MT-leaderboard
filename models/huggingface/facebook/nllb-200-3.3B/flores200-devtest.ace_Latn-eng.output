Martelly was sworn into the new Council of Provincial Elections (CEP) with nine new members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month the presidential commission announced the resignation of CEP as part of a package of measures to prepare the country for the new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that erupted in October.
Protests have been sparked by violence over the lack of proper elections, including in early 2011.

No mass transportation with an above-ground grid will stop at Wembley, and no motorcycle parking facilities and no motorcycle parking is provided on the ground.
The lack of wire transport makes it very likely that the crew will be forced to move quickly without the support of a team.
A study published today in the journal Science suggests the presence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden found that a new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to have taken much longer, due to cross-breeding between the endemic Darwin's cactus, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
The spheres can be divided into all kinds of shapes.
The spindle can be pulled into a smooth wire, which can be cut and sewn. The spindle can be moved or rolled into a ball.
It can be cut very smoothly, and then embossed onto other metals. It can be so smooth that it is sometimes used to embellish hand-drawn images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical.You can make an indicator out of red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is indicated by the number of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being measured.
The hydrogen ion is the proton from which the electron is released (because the hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
And he put the two rings together, and put the rings together, and put the rings together, and put the rings together.

The table was a part of the bathhouse where men and women met.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in outer space received a call and then was launched back, almost to a halt.
Satellites are sent into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light from our view.
A rocket launch vehicle is a large rocket that is designed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in many ways. The biggest thing it has done for us is to give us more transportation, more speed.
The wheel has provided us with cars, motorcycles, and other means of transportation.
The lower jaw is more dense than the middle ear, and the middle ear is almost as dense as the lower jaw.
Finally, there are many small (and often unremarkable) insects that eat small, skin-colored insects such as lizards, rats, mice, and birds.
The reason for their success is the niche concept, a specialized job held by each individual that allows them to compete with others.
Lions are social creatures, living in large groups called prides.
She hath taken in her pride three strong men, and three hundred [women] with her children.
It is customary to have a queen-to-be, a queen-to-be, or a queen-to-be.
A pride of lions acts like a flock of foxes or dogs, and a lion that is scared of lions (but not other mammals) in a den, is dangerous to its own population.
An athlete with good physical skills, can run fast (even if not fast), swim, run for a minute and pull with five strong maneuvering sticks.

Scientists think that the ocelot follows the fish to find food (feeding) and to feed, closely following where they are on the ground.
They have excellent night vision and night-vision, and are able to move about freely. The ocelot chases its prey by mixing with its neighbours and then attacking them.
When a small group of migratory birds (small populations) become separated from their main population (by being moved to a bay or river, or by being moved to a new island so they cannot survive the harsh environment), they will often find themselves surrounded by previously uninhabited shore.
These new environments have different resources and different expectations, so that new populations will require different features or adaptations to become more resilient than they were before.
The aboriginal population has not changed at all, they are still adapting to the same conditions as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new surroundings, they begin to become more distinct from other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will have diverged enough to not be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen which consumes manure, and plants use carbon dioxide which is produced by manure (soil, water).
Plants make food from sunlight by photosynthesis.
and we have built our houses with the plants, and made our clothing of the plants; and we have eaten the plants of the field: there is no green grass in the field.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its era, so it was not a threat to any species, except other mosasaurs.
Its long, arched tail, with more than 70 teeth per hour, and an additional set of teeth in the roof of its mouth, meant that it had no way to pass through its mouth.
We're not sure, but it's possible that their tongues are sharp, and they're probably turtles, big ants, other mosasaurs, and maybe even some animals that are cannibals.
It has also attacked the black rhinoceros in the sea; even giant dinosaurs like the T. rex are unmatched.
Venus is a relative of theirs, the Romans had a variety of strange and unusual animals, including wild boars, foxes, birds, and many other creatures.

When you see the movie National Treasure, you may think that the map is the last treasure left behind by the Information Society.
But it is not right, that the secret of the dregs should be hidden; for it is a treasure hidden from the wise.
The inscription on the back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776", which appears on the front of the document, in reverse.
Because no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is likely that it was originally a large work of information (at least 293⁄4 rings by 241⁄2 rings) that was needed to be transcribed.
But it's just the way it's written.
And when the days of the fighting were ended, the northern part was delivered up; but the southern part was not delivered.

Within two weeks of the American and French attacks, Meurdekeka had the French released and left for Germany.
A civilization is a culture that emerges from a group of living and working together, a community.
The word civilization derives from the Latin civilis, meaning "civil" and Latin civis, meaning "people" or "village", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city", and is often used to describe the measurement of social status.
Cities are the foundations of nations; a civilized culture that shows the way to the perpetuation of knowledge for a few generations; a culture that is not bound to the forces of justice.
This small culture often leaves no trace of its history and cannot be called a civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the First Thirteen Colonies had a weak central government and Congress as the only components of the Confederate budget.
Congress has the power to impose taxes, and, since it has no national executive or judiciary, it is up to the state authorities, who are often non-cooperative, to enforce them.
And it came to pass on that day, that the king appointed a tribute and a tax for the land.
The problem is that these people are so far from the central government that they don't even know what the central government is.
The Italian national team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful national team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, swimming, rugby, ice hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are popular in the North, with Italians competing in international events such as the Olympic Games.
With an area of about 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), Japan is the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the clusters of islands, Japan is sometimes referred to, in geographical terms, as "the islands".
Taiwan was first visited in the 15th century, when European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the production of native grains and hiring Chinese labourers to work on the farm and in the sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) gained control of the western and northern parts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing government in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded southern Taiwan to Japan, which governed the territory until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three-storied Room.
Many of the houses have been restored twice and rebuilt to give a more realistic view of how beautiful the house really is.
In 1976, three percent of Machu Picchu was re-purposed and this work continues to this day.
In fact, the world's oldest surviving photographic film is 35mm, the oldest surviving film in the analogue film era.
This is still a difficult question to answer, but more importantly it is the aspect ratio that has been inherited in the image sensor of digital cameras.
The 35mm size is actually 36mm in length plus 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this measure (which is divided by two to find the most common ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many of the common formats (from APS to format, etc.) are similar or closer in aspect to this ratio.
The third most commonly ignored and least frequently cited rule of thumb is a common guideline for interpreting the changes in the size of the data set in an image.
It is said that the most obvious place for the first is at the intersection of the three lines that divide the image into three parallel lines (see diagram).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, with its wealth and power, gained prominence.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united all European countries despite their differences in language and culture.
He maketh the king and the people alike, and maketh the lowly and the strong.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this centralization of power and authority has led many to question whether this concept was fulfilled.
Soon after the battle, the British began to attack the Germans at sea.
The plan was to be successful, it would have been a disaster for the military and society, but it would soon have violated the universal law that was accepted by all nations for the last two centuries.
The British maintained a maritime jurisdiction over the islands to prevent any ships from entering the islands, which could be disastrous for the regular ships.
From this point on, the Germans were expecting a similar attack on the German battleship.
By the 1920s, the most visible challenge to societies and nations was the choice of peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors of war during World War I, the nations were prepared to end the war in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Works in New York City.
He came to the United States with four pennies in his name, a book of poetry, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his former job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China has a distinctive way of representing different periods; each period of China or each ruling family is in a separate dynasty.
Each dynasty had a distinct period of history and territory, the most notable of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, during the Han and Jin dynasties.
And it came to pass in those days, that there was a great war between the sons of Ammoni, who went to make themselves king over the sons of Ammoni.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest period in Chinese history, as many Chinese died to gain their rightful place in the imperial court of Xi'an.
There were many social and political consequences such as the use of the feudal system, the shift from absolute to republicanism, the sense of national identity and the equivalence of the state as a community rather than a single ruler.
The revolution in pottery made it possible for men to open a hole in the walls of their houses, and for women to make a hole in the walls of their homes.
The military is similar in that it is not a ranking system, but rather a hierarchical system.
The French Revolution also inspired many people living in the hard labor of the expatriate to make a revolution.
Muhammad's longing for things beyond the ordinary life was reflected in a cave that became known as the cave of Hira on Mount Nur (light) for shelter.
He was buried in a cave, which he had built into the rock, which was a clear representation of Muhammad's spiritual self.
The cave was separated from the rest of the land, on the top of the mountain, which was on the north of Mecca.
In fact, it's not easy to tell when someone entered the cave, as the cave is very isolated.
The heavens are open, the mountains are covered with the beauty of the clouds; the eyes of the blind see, the ears of the deaf hear,
The great pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that is still standing.
Built by the Muses in the 3rd century BCE, the Great Pyramid was one of many pyramids built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Great Wall of Giza, or the "Giza Plateau" of the Pyramids of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several shrines, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, steeples, and sacred places were built in honor of Khufu's wife and members of his court.
The "up" arrow looks like a V and the "down" arrow looks like a cross or a crossbar.
For thou shalt not lift up the bow from the shoulder, nor shalt thou lift up the bow from the shoulder:
The bow that falleth down is soft, but the dart that goeth down is strong.
You might want to look at the signs themselves, but remember that these curved signs are cool because of the music, but they're usually pretty well-written.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two younger daughters (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's mother, the mistress of the Princess Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a group of merchants on 6 October 1789.
They were driven back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The four of them forced the King and Queen to open the window of the palace.
At one point, a public figure looks at the royal guests at Versailles and sees the Queen in a state of turmoil.
The cost of the US imperialist war in the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial government to pay for some of the money and flowers were sent in the name of the Philippine government to the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the great profits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipinos are the profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, a scholar must understand the many different things that constitute a system.
The Middle Ages is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages began in the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which was convected to end in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the impetus of technology or the necessity of technology to the strict definition that human beings are driven by fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism fall into two broad categories: first, that technological developments are guided by means that are largely outside the scope of cultural or political influence; and second, that technology in turn has an "effect" on socially constrained societies.
For example, some argue that motor vehicles must lead to the development of highways.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for only a few motor vehicles, so new production methods are being proposed to reduce the cost of motor vehicles.
Mass motorcycle ownership has also been a major contributor to the increased number of road traffic accidents, leading to the need for new techniques in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism was a major influence on cultural determinism, taken up by writers such as Gothe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography represented a person, and often the customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and this, as well as the place of the people, were better than laws that enforced what was pleasing to them.
As Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as a center of luxury from about 400 BC and flourished until about 1100 BC.
Its status declined during the 12th century due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices worth more than what was handed out by the Byzantine market.
It was during this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style is usually dated between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
The early period was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
He's a man of many talents, a man of many words, and he lives 25 to 30 years in the West.
The Crusades in the Middle Ages in Western Europe began to take their toll. One of the great advances of the era was that the crusaders began to use the spear to defend their own shields.
Subsistence agriculture is the agricultural practice of producing enough food to sustain a person's daily needs.
Subsistence agriculture is a system of simple, often organic, farming that uses seeds native to a protected ecoregion and harvests them through crop rotation or other simple methods to obtain a good harvest.
Historically, some of the world's largest subsistence farms have always been developed countries.
Subcultures unite people who feel excluded from the public and may develop a sense of self.
Subcultures may be distinguished by their ethnic, cultural, geographical, and/or social group-based characteristics.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or social reasons.
Subcultures often mark their groups by symbolic signs, which are used to represent, define, and indicate the approach.
One of the most common ways of illustrating social importance is by using a series of images of children who are poor, uneducated, or otherwise uneducated, often with little or no information about their development.
Some children are called "little" or "little". Some children are called "little" by people (usually by their parents); in some countries, these children are not humiliated because their parents do not want to hurt the child's brain or body.
Is there any fear in the child of the wild, in the child that is born, in the child that is brought forth?
Some man [is] upon his beast, and some man is altogether a wanderer.
When raised by nonhuman animals, wild cubs display a fear (in the body) of almost all predators, such as fear or aversion to humans.
While the sound-based project created a simpler and more beautiful sound, the composers went a step further.
Counting is not a method of measuring how many people want to learn new skills or use a new computer program or start a new project.
The desktop can be virtual or real, in other words, a desktop is not a desktop but a small desktop in Microsoft Office.
Virtual sex is a software system that enables you to ask, answer, and share questions and procedures that might be difficult for a student to answer on their own.
And they shall dwell in the valley of the shadow, because of the multitude of the tumult, because of the violence, and because of the fury of the robbers.
The child is not born to be taught, but to be brought up in the way.
We consider the Child Care System as a zone that is suitable for these children.
Our child-rearing system is based on a safe home, a responsible parent, good hygiene, and proper health care.
For the wife of a man is a burden to her, and a burden to her house.
The Internet incorporates elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive nature of the Internet leads to an additional dimension in terms of approach and usage gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Self-engagement and ongoing engagement were also identified as aspects of new motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied participants' reactions to websites.
The use of video recording can be particularly useful in the interpretation of microexpressions, such as facial expressions that move in a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is believed that a person can tell if a person is lying by evaluating the microexpression of the truth.
Olver Sacks, in his paper The Presidential Address, showed how people who cannot speak because of a brain injury can be considered illiterate.
He even suggested that the concept of a healthy human being is similar to that of a healthy animal.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic types: hidden and revealed.
Mutations create new genetic traits, and selection removes them from the original assemblage.
Segregation and recombination remove the back-to-back line between the two sets of genes in each generation.
Outside the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to obtain its amino acids from the available plant resources.
In addition, lack of exercise has negative consequences: depression, obesity, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most abundant plant source of protein is the protein found in the leaves and stems of the nut, but this is difficult for primates like us to digest except in the case of insects.
In contrast, animal foods (meat, poultry, and fish) are not only digestible, but also provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savanna today.
Breastfeeding is the process of maintaining a healthy weight during your normal breastfeeding time and for several years after (10-60 minutes).
It is a whistle that will be made to sound, and a whistle that will be silent, to bring you to your watch, and it will not be true.
If you find yourself with a bed in your belly, she will put you in another room, forcing you to come down from the bed to the bed.
Selection on other organisms involves the act of urinating (first water or tea, also known as diuretic before drinking), forcing a watchdog to urinate.
The number of bones in a person is directly proportional to the number of joints in the body of the person.
A balanced diet, a positive lifestyle, and the potential for absolute peace and contentment are all within the reach of each individual.
The only thing that prevents us from reaching this goal is our own negative tendencies.
Tibetan Buddhism is rooted in the teachings of Buddha, but has been influenced by the Mahayana teachings and many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. This is one of the Yoga Kundalini, meditation and contemplation that embraces everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the inner light energy) is incorporated into yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, where the roots of the visualization of the various gods and deities are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the light consciousness is created.
The Soviet Union's strategic partnership with the United States during World War II was the basis for the Soviet Union's strategic partnership with the United States. The Cold War was the result of a systemic, cultural process that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Two years after the war, the Cold War began.
It will be back in 40 years time to fight for real, many of the wars in the East, in wars from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish Army was defeated, and the only hope was for a surrender and re-establishment of the Romanian army.
The war, as it came to be known, ended almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered the territory of Belarus and Ukraine after the invasion of eastern Poland, as stipulated by the Riga Pact, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships to carry cargo is now the most efficient way of transporting people and goods across the sea.
The Navy traditionally maintains that your land is open to the movement of your people, while at the same time, it is your enemy's to the movement of your people.
One of the most recent and most important of these was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, in which the United States attempted to evacuate the population of the Atlantic Ocean to British aid.
At the same time, German submarines were attempting to block the passage of the German fleet.
If Germany were to succeed, it would be as likely to subjugate Britain as the rest of Europe.
The first of these was probably dug 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes built domes to facilitate the production of milk, flour, meat and meat.
The commonly used method of keeping sheep in herds that roam the hills or graze elsewhere, where the herdsmen are usually children or young adults, is still used today.
Chariot tracks were introduced in England in the early 16th century.
The chariot of fire was sometimes made of beautiful wood, and the chariot of fire was allowed to ride on the horses of the chariot, which were much larger and much heavier than the horses of the chariot of the day.
Crossties were originally used to secure the wheel in place, although it was gradually realized that the wheel was too heavy to support the wheel.
This can be done by many people, but it is more difficult to do it by a wheel.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first railway was introduced.
The earliest known forms of transportation were the feet, which were used by humans for transportation about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "upright man").
In their absence, Australopithecus did not walk upright.

Acceptance is what Aristotle thought in all sciences, including physiology.
Although the Greeks rejected this idea, Westerners generally rejected the idea of a Greek philosophy of science.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often involve endogenous cycles and are regulated by biological organisms.
Periodic rhythms, which are not necessarily designed for external periodic signals, have been recorded in many living things, including insects, fungi, trees, and animals.
A biological cycle is a natural oscillator that continues for a certain period of time without external conditions.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first attempts to prove that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into the cell.
They performed two experiments to detect DNA in phages containing radioactive phosphorus or proteins in phages containing radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of causes depending on the mutation type, the type of genetic material affected and whether the cell is a cell of interest.
Mutations in the stem-cell can be passed on to the offspring, as can mutations in the breeding sites for cell death or cancer.

How did transportation systems come to be, how did they fail, how did they fail, how did the transportation engineers fail, or did they fail?
A traffic light is a pedestrian sign that connects two points and communicates with each other.
Unfortunately, learning traffic is difficult because the behavior of motorists is not known for a hundred percent.
In particular, motorists often tend to remain in the same category; therefore, traffic directions often have the same order and can be mathematically represented in the same way.
To show the most accurate direction of traffic, we have used the equations of three fundamental forces: (1) direction, (2) load, and (3) velocity.

Content theory focuses on what drives people to move or be active.
These theories suggest that people have a certain amount of energy and/or energy that they have accumulated as they age.
These theories deal with the question of whether certain people are motivated to do certain things by the things that surround them that make them do or not do certain things.
Two of the most well-known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two factors emerge when managers start to take on the leadership of the workforce that is behind them: One is the spectrum of attempts to remain one of the men (or women).
This type of manager has trouble making informed decisions, exercising discipline, evaluating work, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, individuals who transform themselves into strangers feel the need to change the group's structure and create their own.
I think that if you're going to be a leader, you're going to be a leader, but you're not going to be a leader.
These decisions often result from conflicts between the leader and other members of the team.
Virtual groups are essentially the same as conventional groups, but with some minor differences.
Members of virtual groups often function as contact points for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional groups because their groups are better adapted to the different climate zones that may be understood by their local management.
The physical existence of real "invisible groups" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a unique component of virtual groups.
An "invisible group" is a management group that has individual reporting members; the invisible group sets standards for the types of members.
Why would an organization want to go to such lengths to build a learning organization? One goal of bringing the concept of a learning organization into practice is innovation.
When things need to be true and good to turn the living part of an organization, creativity and authenticity are the key.
Thus, the work of an organization working together to understand the interdependencies will lead to a new innovation that meets the needs of the users.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a shared innovation culture and share knowledge with the rest of the organization.
Angel (2006) describes the continuous approach as a means of helping organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The data from neurobiology provides a clear proof of how a theory can be viewed, and this narrows the field to make it more accurate.
The relationship between the brain and the brain stem is the one that helps the brain to make decisions.
It has been known in the past that brain damage, such as trauma, injury, and tumors, can affect a person's ability to function mentally.

It takes a lot of work and a lot of things to build a model of the brain that will help us understand what's going on in the brain.
Although AI is not a single entity in the realm of science, AI forms a branch within the realm of computer science, which deals with the study of decision-making, learning and how a machine adapts.
The AI is built with the spirit of making the machine do automated tasks that allow it to perform complex tasks.
The machine is capable of control, planning and scheduling, can respond to diagnostics and user queries, and can recognize gestures, voices and faces.
These things are going to be different kinds of problems, like looking at the answer to the problem of life.
AI systems are now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as well as in many home computer and video game software applications.

Blogs can also help students improve their language learning. While students can improve their blog experience with a good grammar and spelling, people often change it.
While students often become the most critical, bloggers began to struggle to become better writers without criticism.
Blogs "forcing students to learn more about the world around them". The need to interest the viewer is more than the motivation for the student to engage in conversation (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a collaborative tool that encourages students to spread knowledge beyond traditional school days.
Using a proper blog "can encourage students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can better understand their own context of others and how to deal with news (Oravec, 2002).
