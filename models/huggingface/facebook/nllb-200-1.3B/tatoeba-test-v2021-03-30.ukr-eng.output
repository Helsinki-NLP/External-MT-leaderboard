I have a question.
That's all it took!
Tom said Mary must still be doing that.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
The boss let me leave early today.
What time is the end of the world?
I never worry.
How sweet!
When I'm in a bad mood, I start singing.
I don't owe him anything.
Where's your key?
It's going to be pretty cold tonight.
I'm not going to ask Tom for help.

This is delicious!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where does Tom have to do that?
Mary wants me to be on her team.
No one is listening anymore.
You are brave.
You have to do it yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'll sit him there.
Put it down.
Tom came last.

Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do this.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees that.
I got on the wrong bus.
I turned down that offer.
Mary has already done what she should have done.
I was watching Tom.
Did you make a reservation?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.

Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly agreed.
I think Tom is wrong.
Are you all right?
You may be the only one who can do that.
Who's wrong?

What's that you're holding in your hand?
We are busy.
It's time for dinner.
It's unlikely that Tom will forget how to do this.
You drink?
Will Tom do it with you?
Are you awake?
The meeting began at five o'clock.
Mary said she liked doing that.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I've only been to Tokyo once.
I got the electric bill.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom will be all right.

You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
Sami will find out.
A witness who has seen it all is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard it all.
Guess who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.

I play tennis for an hour a day.
Tom is finished.
When I entered the room, she was playing the piano.
You're very sweet.
Where are your manners?
They did not give up hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to arrive?
Tom pulled out his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We should call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Did Tom tell you where the party is?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
This is a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Okay, I'll have some.
I don't want any more.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I don't think Tom will be here today.
Tom opened a restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you are.
To your good health.
Yes, I would love to!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
That's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
Spring is coming.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me this?

Tom is very open-minded.
I'm hungry because I didn't have lunch.
I'm not blaming anyone.
The plane took off at exactly nine o'clock.

I'm turning 16 next month.
Do you think there's a chance that that's going to happen?

I came to say goodbye, Tom.
I like this dog.
I tried to contact her.
What's she got?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing that.

Who told you you could do this?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
