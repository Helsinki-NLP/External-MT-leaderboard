Parliament did not support the novella Liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal the new criminal code clause that condemned opposition leader Julia Tymoshenko.
The amendment, which would pave the way for the release of the imprisoned ex-prime minister, was rejected by the MEPs at second reading.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for allegedly entering into an unfavorable contract with Russia to buy natural gas.
The verdict is not binding, the court is due to hear the appeal in December.
The Tymochenkoya judgment marks political revenge for the regime, suspicion of court involvement has sparked a trial in the West as well.
The proposal to remove Section 365 of the Criminal Code, which condemned the former Prime Minister, was supported by 147 MPs.
It took 226 votes to pass it.
The Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, has already had its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winner is still to be defined.
As is the custom in the country, Islamists win the election, but it's a matter of moderation or radical.
The transitional National Council has signed up for customary Sharia law and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a crime-free country because stealing is a crime.
Women can forget about emancipation, any apostates of faith await execution and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
Libya will be a place where we can't imagine and we certainly wouldn't want to be.
But our way of life is neither the only one nor objectively the best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans mentioned above for change.
It's actually odd that Islamic fighters took revenge on unbelieving dogs.
The only thing that's sorry about them is that, in their view, NATO's strikes were not directed by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness was celebrated in every raid.
So if they're looking for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We participated in the shootings, we served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of a dictator, got rid of their political ally without any guarantee of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
This leaves the local problem of expelling the crusaders.
But without the occupation of the oil companies, will they have Libyan black gold for a handful?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of its unwavering human rights defense.
Unless we're interrupted by those Sharia law professors.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe have been in the spotlight
The statistical crunch was overwhelming across Europe on Tuesday.
The individual countries have published GDP figures for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated in the quarter, Germany and France are growing.
But today, the bond market is breaking records.
Investors are not just looking at Italy anymore, but also Spain, France, Austria and more.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of the economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by an expected 0,5%, France by 0,4%.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany performed better than expected (an increase of 0,3% from the original 0,1%), while France reported a slight decrease of 0,1% (initial data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year on year in the third quarter of this year.
However, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated during the quarter, confirming the trend of a gradual slowdown in the performance of the economy.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year on year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated in the quarter.
The German economy grew by 0,5% in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonal data.
The euro area and European Union economies grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent year on year.
The yield on her 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish bonds are rising to critical limits.
The problems are starting to be felt in Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields on Czech 10-year bonds remain below 4%, even as the situation in the region deteriorates.
Votes from Germany say the ECB should be the creditor of last resort.
The Czechs have qualified for the Euro.
They won 1-0 in Black Mountain and celebrate the 200 million run.
The football team has done the toughest job of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful goalkeeper Peter Jiračka, she won 1:0.
Czech football, with a good deal of luck in the second half, has gained a luxurious home-field advantage and will not miss the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz has been monitoring the match in detail.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a big portion of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, thanks to a home defeat in the final, the great Czech and hero Jiraček, won the Black Mountain 1-0 and celebrates the progress to the European Championship.
The blacks were under pressure in the second half because of their precise defense of the Czech team.
The match's winners were Damjanovic and Vučinić, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and the prize money for domestic football is about 200 million crowns.
There's been a lot of fighting football since the first few minutes.
Both teams were hardly involved in the combination and played mostly around the half-way line.
The pressure from the domestic players did not come in the first half, because the Czech defense precisely repelled the long defensive pitches.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred college students have created a live shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They want to show their support for their country's nuclear program before an Israeli attack.
Students prayed outside the facility Tuesday afternoon and then chanted the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, on Tuesday created a live shield around the Isfahan nuclear technology center, which processes uranium.
They are showing that they are prepared to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in its recent report stated that Iran appears to have not stopped its pursuit of nuclear weapons.
There's talk in Israel of a possible attack on an Iranian nuclear facility.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then chanted the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack that would aim to cripple Iran's nuclear program as much as possible, the Israeli press said that in addition to the Isfahan facility, the target would also be the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.
The diet of an obese child: bridal brunch and dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight, with 9 percent of schoolchildren being overweight and 5 percent of children being obese.
Obese children, however, are often from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as recent research has shown.
It shows once again how important the environment and patterns around it are for healthy human development.
For example, weddings are half as common in families with obese children as in families with normal weight.
Fried fries were eaten the day before a research-related event called Obesity is no coincidence for more than 19 percent of obese people.
Obese families also have a low level of exercise, but this is true of most schoolchildren today - only 15 percent of children said their parents find time to exercise at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last school year and involved almost 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of the Obesity is not a coincidence event sponsored by General Health Insurance and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 pupils from grades 4 to 8 have been involved in the project.
However, proper nutrition and adequate family mobility are among the factors that are causing a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children.
"For example, only half of the respondents said they ate five times a day on breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner, which is a basic requirement for proper nutrition", says one survey.
No breakfast and no wedding night
Experts point out that relative details, such as a regular family breakfast, are also essential for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of schoolchildren's families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst part was finding that 10 percent of households didn't eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that unhealthy fries are much more common in families with obese children.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
While more than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly participated in sports, their parents had less than half - 15 percent.
Make your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed the children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to choose their own menu from the options offered, according to their taste and opinion.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition".
Their favorite foods include a lot of moist, meaty, and sweet foods.
"The high popularity of sweet lemonade is particularly alarming", the final survey report states.
For lunch, pasta won over the poultry.
But the children practically didn't want any snacks, and they're also low on fish and lunch vegetables.
Health Benefits
The study also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they are given the right information.
"The control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the World Lecture on Obesity was not a coincidence, in a number of cases a significant shift in preference towards healthy eating", the results of the project stated.
This was especially notable for sweet lemonade, where more children began to prefer plain water.
Children also had far more frequently included poultry and fish in their questionnaires as their main meal of the day and restricted sweet foods and snacks.
A stylist must be a good psychologist, professionals say.
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I complained so much that there was a lot of stuff in the introductory class.
I had no idea what was coming next.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, dressing up problematic characters, and a seminar on how the market works.
And it's going to get worse.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "stuck".
This time, principal Alenka and I were discussing (there is not a single boy in the class) how to dress a woman who is not perfectly submissive.
And that's the vast majority of them.
Some have short necks, some have a boyish figure without proper curves, and some are overweight.
The stylist must know how to visually shrink the broad shoulders, extend the neck, or add the required curves.
We've been given tips like Jennifer Lopez's, bigger breasts and hips and a tight belt, to make a good impression on the character and not to make a woman too provocative.
For example, if the difference between a passport and a hips is that skirts or trousers do not really fit, then it is worth having at least one of these sewn to measure.
You're not going to regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are free.
You'll feel much better in a suit that's tailored to your needs than one that's constantly moving, twisting, sticking in your skirt and the like.
A male character can afford to wear clothes with a scarf, a sewing machine, a sewing machine, or a sewing machine.
There's a lot of information and character types, of course, so I'm glad I have a whole week to sort all the information out in my head.
And I'm still afraid, given the homework, it's too late.
Each of the course girls was assigned a celebrity to invent two outfits: daytime and evening.
We need to consider the current appearance, fashion style of the person and the type of character.
I'm gonna dress up Miranda Kerr, you may know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my mind, I'm definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has gained over 100 pounds recently (please consider the overweight category), or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut out clothes from magazines or search the Internet and print them and then graphically process them.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, then expresses our personal style and relationship to graphic imaging.
It's important to think about the graphic aspect of styling.
The stylist not only dresses physically but also creates, for example, product pages in magazines (for specific purposes, such as trends in handbags, coats, etc.).
That's what Mario Kameník, the designer and designer, told us.
But not until Sunday.
A stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture, filled with information about the types of characters, was immediately greeted by three industry guests.
Stylist Honza Pokorny, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a skilled stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is key in this case.
For example, a trenchcoat (or, if you want to start with, a trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a shirt as a coat, but you can also wear it on a bare body, a boat sling, and a dress.
Or you just wrap your sleeves or your bandages around and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it", he insisted.
But what I appreciated most was this advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work".
"Then you can start breaking them", said Jacob.
So I finally understand why we're trashing all these tips, what to combine with, what to do, why, when we're seeing something different in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist must have a lot more variations of clothing than they can photograph.
So for a fashion story that's going to have ten pages, I have to be ready to "style" at least 15.
And that in the photo, the clothes look and work in combination with other pieces of leckda completely different than they actually do.
So we have to take that into account when we're creating outfits.
That image and style make up only half the success, Honza Humble has confirmed.
You just have to look at Madonna, who's not exactly a miracle singer, but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to stylist services is rather cold.
Even the familiar faces of the people consider him unnecessary.
And if someone is already getting us to create a styling, then we should expect that they are likely to dictate a completely different size than they actually do.
Then all we have to do is google and see if the boulevard hasn't written about the celebrity being fat and stuff.
Honza and Mario on Sunday reminded us that it's not enough for a stylist to be in fashion and know how to fold outfits.
She communicates with the people she dresses with in her work, so it's important to be a good psychologist.
Being able to judge people, not be pushed, stand up for your opinion.
"When a manager orders you to flip her closet and fill it in with nice pieces, you can't throw out the whole closet and say, 'Oh, my God, that's terrible.'"
"Find at least a few things you can commend and recommend for wearing", says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what the so-called "salary" or bag to the square must contain.
It's the one you wrap around your waist and have all the properties you need.
In addition to the obvious items such as scissors, hair rollers, or closing pins, there is also silk thread (a stylist uses it to photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clipboard to draw on the back of clothes if larger (a pin or other bandage is not allowed, which would damage the clothes), or sewing thread.
To not only listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly tie our shoes.
Even in a studio with a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, especially outside.
And so we stuck and stuck.
We can't even touch the shoes with knives, so they don't get hurt by accident.
So it really takes skill.
I was pleased when Mario praised my creation without reservation.
Because that skill isn't really my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of continuing the course.
It's becoming increasingly clear to me that doing styling at a professional level is really not a walk in the rose garden, no matter who wants what they want.
Need for Speed: The Run is racing across America.
Reviews
The original careless ride is turned into a routine morning ride to the barge by a series of completely unnecessary trivial mistakes.
The ambition has been largely met, but it's not worth it when no one seems to want to do anything extra.
The new subtitled The Run raised high expectations before its release.
He promised to take the Need for Speed racing series a little bit further and from the playable screenshot, it was a game that didn't have to be just a number in the action racing genre.
We were also curious about the fate of the inserted passages where the protagonist gets out of the car and runs around.
But as is the custom of the NFS series, many of the results are a little different than we expected.
It's potentially a decent arcade race, but the whole thing is dragging down a few unnecessary bugs that have been appearing in the series for years or so.
So it's not really a mistake, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story whose protagonist Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You'll be driving on the west coast in San Francisco and your task is to be the first to arrive in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, followed by more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes a different course and that the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't get the feeling that the game is always the same.
Some of the environments are also very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics matches the previous installments of the series.
So it's not a world war.
But driving through the desert, autumn landscape, or high in the snowy mountains is visually very pleasant.
In addition, races are occasionally marred by some unusual element.
For example, in the desert, you're in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
In the mountains, you must be careful not to fall asleep in the avalanche.
Besides, the individual races are well planted.
There are only a few types, but that's enough.
You try to beat the required number of opponents (basically a classic race), then you catch up with time (a classic race with tracks) and then you might be in a duel with a single opponent.
And the police get involved from time to time, and they're making your efforts even more unpleasant.
The news is that we're out of the car.
It's more of an interactive animation where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
It's not complicated.
Surprisingly, though, there are far fewer of these episodes in the game than you might expect (even three, in particular).
But in the end, it's for the better, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying, and in the context of the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more difficult.
The ride model follows in the footsteps of previous models.
That means it's definitely not a bad thing these days, but it's not a bad thing.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But for the more action-packed race, the model here still fits pretty well, even though we could have found better in the competition.
So far, everything is fine.
But problems start to appear after a while.
Unlike the roadster, the collision model is no longer very good.
We don't expect this kind of game to involve complex deformations and collisions, but if you have no idea how your car will behave before you hit an object, then probably not everything is quite right.
Typically, when you pass or drive cars in a regular traffic, sometimes you just slightly slip on each other, but other times, in almost identical situations, your car ends up in wild pyrute.
Or even attack directly.
The restart system doesn't really bother you, but it'll set you apart.
Restarts are solved in such a way that if you crash or go far off the track, the game throws you back to the last catch point on the track.
But there are only five restarts available in each race.
When you run out of them, you have to start the race again.
So it's more like a help in case something goes wrong than you can literally rely on.
But sometimes even restarting doesn't help, they're solved by learning the race track by heart.
The big drawback of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves need to be passed in a specific way, or you just can't get into them.
Other times, you'll meet "civil" cars in the same configuration at the same location, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds early or a minute later.
This is especially irritating when you see the opponent passing between two cars in front of you easily, while when you do, the cars are already in such a position that you have to go around them or brake them.
It doesn't matter when you go to them, because it's "counted" so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
The opponents have another advantage.
During the game, you will encounter several places where, again, no matter the time, you will always be outnumbered by the same opponent in the same place.
It's most pronounced at the end of the game on a long bridge, where you're going in a counter-measure.
The enemy must obviously get there before you at any cost.
Because when it gets ahead of you, it makes you less aware of the anti-toxic vehicles, so you probably get a few good rides there at first.
You can understand the intention of making the game more exciting and adrenaline-filled, but the execution is so obvious that it will quickly make you feel uncomfortable.
And that's a shame, because despite the simple ride model, the game is fun and the seats are so action-packed that sometimes you literally don't even watch where it flies.
And it doesn't really matter if it's the concept of 50 unique tracks, the race sequences so that boring doesn't have a chance, or anything else.
It's an unconventional idea to change cars during races.
You have to be careful with the gas pumps on the road, because that's where you can change the car, even though in the vast majority of cases you're just getting used to what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American highway springs for straight roads, and exotic super sports for technical riding, such as on steep mountain roads.
The main story mode goes hand in hand with the challenge mode, which are races in the individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but experience points for your profile, which is common to both challenges and story.
The driver's level is enhanced by the use of various items: starting with cars and ending with profile backgrounds.
It is also connected to the Autolog online feature, which compares your results with other players and obtains additional community features.
Another difficult-to-understand stumbling block is the situation at the last race in the story.
You'll drive into a subway tunnel (buddhi) where you'll be married in the dark on the railways (buddhi).
The tachometer flashes between 150 and 200 km/h (about 200 mph) and the subway system crumbles in the back and uncompromisingly crushes you.
I think we're gonna have a few more days at the editorial office discussing whether or not anyone really thought about making a game or whether or not the authors think we're really such big assholes.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is very pleasant in most cases and in some cases even great.
It's so cold that at some more pressing moments, the filming drops, and in some cases, quite tragically.
But this is especially true of a crash with a larger number of participants, when smooth shooting would be no longer valid.
The soundtrack is fine, and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an attempt to appeal to a wider audience, rather than a younger audience, a soundtrack was created in the category "every dog a different village", but one can assume that listening to music will not make anyone buy the game.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so much more dismal.
If the game avoided completely unnecessary errors, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best NFS work in the last few years.
But that's how the game works.
Fun is fine, but be prepared for mistakes to tear you apart by the force of airport headlights.
The UK Singing Choir will perform at the Student's Concert
The combination of the celebrations of International Cold Day and the anniversary of the Samet Revolution with the musical experience is offered by the Festa Academica festival for the third time.
During this time, he will perform for 20 high school and college choirs.
The main focus of the festival is two concerts on November 17.
"Charles University has a big stake in the festival".
"Among the participating groups is the Choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanities, the festival committee will be chaired by the Rector Václav Hampl", said the head of the organizing team, Jakub Čaloun.
The highlight of the festival is the publicly accessible concert of the high school choirs, which will take place on 17 November from 2pm on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program features a song by the Czech jazzman Karl Růžička.
In the evening, the Concert "Students of the Samet" will be held in the ceremonial premises of the National House in Vinohrady, where university choirs including the choirs of the University of Karlovy Vary will perform.
The aim of Festa Academica is not only to celebrate the International Day of Students and commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Samet Revolution with dignity, but also to present choral music at the highest level to the public and to develop creative cooperation among young people.
The main organiser is the Union of Czech Singing Choirs in cooperation with Jan Keplér Gymnasium.
The mayor of Prague, Bohuslav Svoboda, and the rector of the Charles University, Václav Hampl, took over the whole event.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
In addition to the festive concerts, the schedule also offers a variety of musical meetings, student happening, matinee and other programs.
The festival website www.festaacademica.cz is a place where participants can find detailed information.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a report on the implementation of the programme.
The Czech Republic has a reputation for being negative and Euroskeptic
"The Treaty of Lisbon has severely disturbed the balance between the institutions".
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war".
"It will take five or six years before the situation is a little settled, calm and all the players get used to their new roles", Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicen began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She showed how serious she is about her motto 'Clearly and openly about Europe' in the first part of her lecture, when she managed to describe the EU institutions and their relations in a way so clear and understandable that she could be envious of the UK Law School.
Vicen also commended the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"First, there was criticism that he was a lowly, that he was a gray officer, that he couldn't play any part, and I must say, everyone was blown away by the fact that he did the part well".
"He is a man who can listen to the 27 Member States, communicate with them well and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go".
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was then explained as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What phone number should I call?" as an important step towards unifying and increasing the readability of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from cheese
Vicen also focused on the agenda that the European Council has been living, is living and will live on in the near future.
Last year's Czech presidency declared it a success.
The Czechs have been dealing with the coming financial crisis, resolving the gas crisis or hosting the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The fall of the government at this time was then described as a major negative that had caused great damage to the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador, the "fact frmol" was not only the presidency but also the ensuing financial crisis that is being addressed to this day.
In addition, the new seven-year Union budget has yet to be approved, which is complicated by the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be slim and economical, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which less, is all on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, which she brought to Brussels: "On Europe understandably".
"I really don't like ugly acronyms, foreign words, a joke that nobody understands.
How can a citizen understand that there are no curved or rounded cucumbers in Brussels, bananas of different sizes, or that we really need to have cheese banned?"
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
We are in a fast-paced Europe
According to the ambassador, Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who are more aware of the negative than the positive aspects of things.
In addition, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
She says a lot of factors are to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation, but also the low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, the Frenchman next to me will say, 'Hey, what are you doing there, your Visegrad Four?' and he's not even excited about it".
The future of the Union, according to Vicen, is mainly characterised by new hard rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
He sees the concept of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, rather than a new 'European Federation' as very real.
"We have euro area countries and countries outside the euro area".
"We have the Schengen area, we already have the Institute for enhanced cooperation".
"For the first time, it was said that only countries that wanted to cooperate and those that didn't want to stay away should cooperate".
"There will be more of these institutions and it will be a strongly two-speed Europe", Vicen expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all issues having an impact on the whole Union should be discussed among all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM's inventor is entering the second century of its existence.
If anyone were looking for the word that would most accurately express IBM's strategy, the closest thing would probably be "longevity".
To the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, a company that is seen as very modern, yet it's been a hundred years since its founding.
The foundation for this long-term vision was laid by the firm's first chief executive, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already issued a slogan that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the imprint of the future giant's life (and also the name of an internal magazine that IBM started publishing in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully crafted corporate culture.
"For us at IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement toward the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a hundred years because it remained true to its core values and was not afraid to change everything around it.
It allowed us to transform technology, business, and society during our first century.
We hope that we can achieve even more in the second hundred", said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current CEO.
The system developed
In the 1930s, Watson took care of his employees much like the businessman Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM employees were among the first American employees to have paid leave, employer insurance plus an elegant uniform and a sophisticated system to reward the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
IBM's long-term customer relationship is as sophisticated as it is.
The company was brilliant at bringing talent to the table from the beginning -- one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is for Palmisana to be succeeded as IBM's head next year by a woman, Virginia Rometty.
She's been with IBM for 30 years, still holding the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been doing so-called online brainstorming in recent years, which has led to many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder there's plenty of ideas - almost half a million people work at the company.
Institutions with good reputation
A firm position in the business is secured by a firm's strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology company", said Harvard Business School professor of economics and author of the IBM book Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems through technology", added George Colony of Forrester Research, a consulting firm.
As the company itself says, there's a difference between entering the market and creating the market.
IBM, or "Big Blue", as it is affectionately called in the United States because of its logo, has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a hundred years.
It's probably the most versatile tech company -- developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services across a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any American technology company, and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include, for example, an ATM, a payment card, a financial swap, a barcode, or a floppy disk.
IBM, with about $220 billion, became the second-largest tech company by market capitalization this year (first is Apple), after Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
A view of the future
Not all products and innovations were in line with the tastes of customers and the times - for example, IBM did not bet on its own operating system OS/2, Prodigy's online service or IBM PCjr.
"If your business is built on moving forward, you cannot emotionally re-enter the past", notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on multiple platforms -- and if they don't work, they leave.
Unlike, for example, competing Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
IBM's revenue is largely driven by services, with software and hardware accounting for about a fifth.
Yet, back in 1990, hardware was the most powerful representative, with more than half of the share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-income assets, while investing $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
Investment has continued since 2008, when the modern financial crisis first overtook the world.
IBM is following the advice of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, it seems IBM is going through the current crisis untouched.
IBM's stock price has risen 120 percent since early 2008, and the company's net profit is continuously growing.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything, not just its values.
So we can expect that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will handle it.
IBM history: From the cheesecake to space flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago, originally under the complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM did not take on until 1924 - originally a trademark used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation for IBM was laid by the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technology such as the famous "hourglasses", or clocks, that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new firm was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also served as chairman of the company's board of directors until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a competitor firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - Watson's ideas are still building on an unbeatable corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started by manufacturing and selling all kinds of machines for businesses - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson's tenure, the company doubled its turnover to nine million dollars and began a major expansion into all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after nearly 40 years in the chief executive chair, his son, Thomas Watson Jr., took his place.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM's humans and computers helped NASA fly to space -- to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the famous manned moon landing.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "piece" that established the computer standard of the time, called the IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer manufacturing to Lenovo, instead purchasing the consulting business of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and began to fully engage in high-value consulting and services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off for the last three years is the concept of the Smarter Planet, "smarter planets".
It aims to make smart use of technology in areas not yet planned, and to improve the situation, for example, in transport and urban administration.
For the business sector, IBM recently launched the "Smart Commerce" platform, which helps merchants manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history at home.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is based in Prague and there is also a world-class voice recognition research team.
The knight about an unfaithful husband:
Ivete, keep that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtari, 53, has said it's over!
After her husband Joseph Richter (53) became not only the protector of Ivete Bartoš (45) but also her lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now she's not ready to wait and set clear rules for the rest of her life.
"Pepa can go home, but not as my partner anymore", explained the richard.
When Darina Richter granted Bartoš asylum in her home this summer, she apparently didn't even think about how her marriage would end.
Even though Iveta had moved out of the River after 30 days at her insistence, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted to loving her.
In time, Darina resigned, reconciled herself to her husband's relationship, and now even said goodbye to him forever.
The ruler doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If the Knight and Barthos had broken up once, his wife's open arms would not be waiting for him at home.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common home, no one will drive him out".
"But he will live it not as my beloved, strayed old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties", said Richter, who has already broken up with her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
Joseph doesn't mind Darina closing the back door on him yet.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'm going to be with Ivetta, and I'm not going to change it".
"My wife arranged a paper marriage, and I respect that".
"The company keeps going, I'm fixing up, gardening, real estate, shopping".
"Darin and I have a normal conversation, except we don't share a bed", said Lightning Horseman.
If the Knight finds a new love, she won't stop her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she goes with, or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Ivetta and I take all the responsibility", concluded Joseph.
Worst female bad habits: Do they affect you?
When you ask men if they can name any of the common female misdeeds, they usually all get out of hand very quickly.
Dear women, do you recognize the following lines that list some of the female bad habits that can perfectly pump blood into men's veins?
Purchasing
Does your other half blame you for being a shopping addict?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
You buy like and bulk at discounts?
Then in your case, shopping can be considered a habit.
Some women realize that they should at least restrain their shopping passion.
But tell me, who would resist just going around the clothing store looking for the perfectly fitting outerwear and then trying them all out (ideally in different colors) in the cabin?
While shopping is a hobby for most women, it can become a hell of a deal for men.
Just remember how many times you've told your friend to wait for you outside...
Constant Dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you even like me?"
Do these sentences remind you of anything?
- You did?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with how they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to their partners constantly complaining about their looks.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more frequent this complaint is, the more annoying women are.
Order and Cleanliness First
It's like an endless roller coaster.
She washes windows, vacuum, wipes the tile, wipes the dust, shakes the bathtub - at least twice a week.
You blame your partner for stepping on a dirty foot on a clean tile, the kids for dirting a torn sink and crushing a glass living room wall that you've worked so hard to polish?
If you suffer from this "inclination", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated, and that family order and cleanliness should not be the first priority.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can jeopardize your relationships and your family well-being.
Fishing
"Throw those used dresses in the basket".
"Are you gonna wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"A wet scrub is not the land".
If you are sneaking into your partner like this several times a day, you can make sure that you can get him out of the way.
Of course, you don't mean it badly, you want to make sure everything's okay.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to go through all this stuff...
The Slander, the Slander
Some women also have their own gossip, gossip, and insult and collusion.
Women are relationship-focused, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how, and why.
I hope each of us will throw some little harmless gossip or slander in there.
Hand on heart, it's for every woman.
On the contrary, the most grossly mischievous are the ones who love and often mischievous, perhaps disdainful, and are especially dangerous to their environment - especially within the female working class.
Jagger and the Whale helped Philadelphia win the game with assists.
Hockey forward Jaromír Jagr took part in Monday's NHL game with two assists in Philadelphia's 5-3 win over the Carolina Ice and is again leading the Czech players' productivity in the competition.
The 30-year-old star's review was taken advantage of in both cases by Claude Giroux, who added another extra point and was named the game's MVP.
Two assists in the game were also scored by Jagr's teammate Jakob Voráček.
After the game, Jagr told overseas reporters he was predicting a big night for the Giroux.
"I told him before the game he was gonna score a hat trick".
"I felt it".
"Sometimes you get that feeling", explained Jagr, after Giroux scored the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later, the second attack on the Czech team was a trail.
The lead man was hitting a roller coaster at the Hurricanes gate and putting it in the rings to scoring Max Talbot.
The second before the first break, Patrick Dwyer was down in the weak home run, but the introduction to the second part was again the Flyers's.
Specifically, the Giroux.
After working with Jaguar, he scored a third goal, then his shot was passed by Wayne Simmonds in the fourth.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three", Jagger praised his center.
"I never thought I'd be playing hockey with a hockey player like him at the end of my career".
"I'm happy about that".
"I want to play him".
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to play me, now it's turning around", added Jagger.
Carolina made a dramatic impact on the game, with a goal from Tuom Root and again from Dwyer, who was out of the penalty shoot-out, getting a one-way tie.
But another complication was not allowed by Matt Read, who ended up counting two to one.
"Pronger has selected our belt.
"He pulled the wheel, I picked up speed and (Read) went to the farther pole".
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out", he described the final goal of the match from his point of view, the Wraith.
Philadelphia has won the Eastern Conference.
Montreal Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček missed a game against Buffalo, retiring in the second quarter due to an upper body injury.
The Candiens, along with the experienced Becks, lost the two-point lead to a 2-3 penalty shootout.
One of their raids was unchanged by Thomas the Bold.
The home coach was more of a late blowout than a losing streak, with only five defenders playing the game.
"It's wrong".
"We only played one game with an experienced player, the rest were young".
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it", said Jacques Martin.
"We were getting hit and we couldn't resist".
"We should have simplified the game, moved the puck out of our belt".
We had gaps in that", added one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ondrej Pavelec contributed 30 Winnipeg hits to a 5-2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' five-game losing streak was split between five different shooters.
How fares have changed since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were authorised in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time sold only tours to the countries of the Socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists have travelled to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (the Black Sea coast) and Hungary (Balaton).
A minor exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when travel to Yugoslavia was also possible, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned to the West and Czech tourists' travel to Yugoslavia was subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely individually, even within socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to, for example, Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation from that country, otherwise an individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered tours to the West, but it was necessary to stay up front overnight with a stroller or have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
But it wasn't won either.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czech currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a foreign exchange commitment, it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for a journey to the West.
By far, the Czech people spent the majority of their holidays in the country, which resulted in the large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs bought and this custom survives to this day.
The Czech travel industry has been undergoing a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
The enormous paradox that we no longer realize is that it was not possible for us to travel freely to Croatia, which is now the most popular country in the world, until 1989, when it was part of Yugoslavia.
As early as the late 1990's, visa requirements for neighbouring Western European countries were abolished, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna and Germany in Austria.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't afford to travel to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to see it for a while.
For example, in Paris, Czechs slept in tent parks because our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of travel in the Czech lands at this time was the carriage of their own food, cans, salads, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech crown, which allowed our tourists to finally freely buy Western currency for many tens of years.
But our standard of living and, with it, our average wages rose, leading to another milestone around 1997.
As a result of increased travel demand, travel agencies began to regularly prepare charter flights from 1997 onwards, making flights incredibly cheaper than in the past due to the possibility of booking quantitative discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs had visa-free access to virtually all developed countries in the world, except the United States, which continued to make travel easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel came in 2000, when, due to high demand, the first direct charter flight to the exotic world was made from the Czech Republic, to Thailand.
Since this year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists to warm distant countries are launched every year, and this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Today, exotic countries are visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States revoked Czech tourist visas, and our country was definitively ranked among the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in history, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50,3%) and for the first time in history spent more than CZK 15 thousand per person on a single holiday abroad, including the cost of stay.
The General Assembly is to find the President, but again, the threat is
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and the successor of Ivan Hašk, head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), is in danger of not being known even after another extraordinary general assembly, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburc.
There is still no agreement on the electoral procedure.
Without it, there won't be a vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The Czech football is run by Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hashek resigned from his post in June and, upon his departure, urged his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football into the future.
But in the era after Hashk, football slipped back into the fray between the two chambers of congress, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
It was fully revealed on September 16, when a new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly gathered in the National House in Prague on Smíchov in vain, because the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a matter of election.
There was also no agreement on who actually had the right to vote in the Assembly - whether only the representatives of the legislature or even the full powers of the delegation.
On this single point, there has since been partial agreement, aided by the Constitution's recommendation for State and law that full representation is not possible.
But there's still a lot of controversy surrounding the electoral process.
The Commission has not been too clear about the situation, and the Executive Committee, which has no other choice in its deliberations, whether regular or extraordinary, is essentially the same.
The perspective on the possibility of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is, how do we move forward in the third round to rule out the possibility of a stroke?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model", stated one of the three vice-presidents of FAČR, Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football at the association's leadership.
According to the regulations of the proposed model, in the third round the candidate with the highest percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Morava is reportedly willing to step down to win the candidate who gets the highest percentage of votes from both chambers.
The Czech Party shall impose a condition that the winner shall have at least a two-thirds advantage in this percentage count.
"If it were to make sense of the two previous rounds, it would completely deny the two-chamber concept", understands the objections of the Moroccan Freedom Party, which says it would be best to remain silent and vote according to the current statutes.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, although the electoral system established by the statutes is estimated to be the most favorable to Pelt of all candidates.
"I wish the vote to be as strict as possible".
"So that no representative nonsense is invented as at the last general assembly", declared the first-time candidate, Viktoria Plzeň, who in his remarks focused primarily on Pelt.
The coat remains optimistic.
He said the new president will be known in Nymburc and he believes the candidates will work constructively together in the future.
"Everyone's passion will be at ease with the national team's progress to the European Championship today".
"Football will be on a happy wave again, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate", says the Apple executive, who has the greatest experience of managing football at both the professional and regional levels of the trio.
The rack is more restrained.
"I hope there's a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very fragmented".
"It's not among the people of the Czech Republic and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the rules on purpose".
"That could cause the blockade of the general assembly to happen again".
"But I hope common sense wins", said Reichl.
There's not much time left for all parties to agree.
Some of the meetings were supposed to take place right in Black Mountain, but I don't know if the football general is going to be complete by the game.
The special flight, which was to be travelled to Podgorica by, among others, Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, which had not flown from Prague this morning due to a technical failure, was looking for a replacement option to transport part of the Executive Committee to the barrage retaliation site.
Finally, there may be a ministerial meeting that is supposed to take place on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to get the divided parties within the country's strongest sports association to agree.
There's a lot at stake: state subsidies, football's credibility and also a general assembly of Czech sports that will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
The maniac is running for president because he can't see the right candidate.
If the head of the football players of Plzeň, Tomáš Paclík, had seen before the extraordinary general assembly a strong candidate who would fulfill all his expectations of the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have even signed up for the top position.
"If there is a good adept, I will fight for him and not vote".
"But in the current situation, no one has been able to find such a person", said CTK Paclík.
In the fight against Miroslav Pelto and Jindřich Reichl, Paclik is motivated to try to avoid Pelt, the supposed favorite of the election, on his way to the head of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that if he wins, he would only last as President until 2013, when a proper general assembly is on the agenda.
He'd like to see an experienced and top-notch manager in the position who's not too involved in football.
"I've spoken to some people who would come to mind".
"It was crazy for me when some people said they didn't even want to identify with Czech football at this point".
"I would like to change that view", he said.
Paclík is now most disturbed by Pelt's association with Plzeň Regional Football Union president Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general assembly.
It's so unacceptable to Paclick that Pelta should be running for president.
"If he wins, the current situation is preserved and nothing in football moves forward".
"Combined with the support of Berbra, who is a skilled businessman, it would not be more beneficial to football", Paclík declared.
It also suggests that Pelt's name was heard in the after-hours of the corruption investigation years ago, but Pelt was acquitted.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football".
"And how we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said Paclík, who also takes note of his old saying that he would "sell the Pelé club if Pelta became president".
If Paclík wins the election on Thursday, he could imagine a future collaboration with Pelto.
Another Rajchl candidate, whom Paclík supported before the September general assembly, which ended in a fiasco, is also considering the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd go to".
"He has great abilities".
"I could imagine him as the head of the team".
"But he wouldn't manage the association".
"I also don't stick my nose where I don't know", said Paclík, who attracted a lot of attention in September by standing behind the appeal of the arbitration panel headed by Madek Macella, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
The freak says he'd dare to run the association.
He is also the head of Plzeň, which celebrated its Premier League triumph with his support in May.
"I have the power to change the football environment to help cultivate it".
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups, which may tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which is done up to disgusting situations", said Paclík, who does not disclose his antipathy to, for example, the Spartan leader Daniel Kretinski.
He also considered the FAFR's relationship with the Czech Olympic Committee, with whom he would lobby political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into sports, to be a priority.
"It's one of the key things the new president should be doing".
"If there is a tax on gambling, as political parties claim, I understand their argument, but they have to say exactly where the money goes", he noted.
Paclík does not take his association with the Pdzenian club as a burden, although he himself claims that the president of the FAČR should be "alien".
The Pelt is connected to Jablonski, Reichl to the Prague Dukla.
"It's not ideal".
"But I don't see the point in hypocritically transferring my shares to someone in the plzeň club and then going back in a year and a half", Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes to the FACR that would rule out electoral stages
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency of Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, he would sit down to have the FACR have new statutes that would definitively rule out disputes over the electoral system in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic about Thursday's Nymburc meeting and believes the election campaign will significantly stifle the football team's success.
Pelta has already promised before the September election that he will focus on representation and raising funds in the event of an election.
He decided to go to the last minute before the last general assembly, so a two-month delay would be a good time to defend his ideas of governing football and present it in a wider context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a very long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday".
"He feels it is high time someone ran the association", says a man who is associated primarily with the apple club but who has served for many years on Sparta and the union's executive committee.
He also believes he has enough experience to run Czech football.
He believes that the current problems with elections are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hask.
"Unfortunately, the June General Assembly passed statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought".
"If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a president since September", Pelta warned.
It was the revision of the most important civil society document that the delegates were to be held accountable for.
"If I become president, I will take it as a personal responsibility and I am willing to take personal responsibility if I fail".
"It's a principle thing we can't live without", says Pelta.
He's trying to stay out of the way of his opponents.
He has previously announced that he can imagine working with Jindrich Reichl, whom he recognizes for his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first vice president.
He didn't attack Tomás Paclík for long, who didn't leave the thread dry on Pelt.
"He's been in football for a little over a year, he's had some successes".
"But his attacks were unworthy and surprised many people in the way of the election campaign".
"And so many of them now question its true nature", he said to his opponent's address to Pelt, who is said to remain true to the proclamations he announced in September.
He believes his greatest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level to the national team.
That should be a football briefcase.
"And I would also try to end all affairs beginning with the Bohemians or the rumors of last year's corruption scandal".
"I would immediately go to the private and public sector to negotiate to secure enough money for the whole football", the 44-year-old candidate told the CBC two months ago.
He also promised that his arrival at the head of football would not mean any personnel clearance.
"I'd like to meet the staff of the individual staff first", he said, referring to the town of Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness from a long period of rulelessness.
Despite the current disastrous scenario that accompanies the assembly, they believe that the delegates will not be traveling to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If the only issue is how to vote in the third round, we can get through it".
"Football needs credibility, and the only way to get it is to finally have its leader back", Pelta remains optimistic two days before what may be the defining day of his career.
The Reich promises that under him the FACR will work hard
If the current vice-president Jindřich Rajchl were elected as the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the general meeting on Thursday, many people in the association would not be happy.
Reichl promises to work hard if elected.
It wants to impose systemic changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by former president Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I'd like to focus on football as a whole".
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national teams, professional football, performance football to youth football".
"I'm not saying I'd do everything alone", Reichl said in an interview with CTV.
"I'm a team player and I want to share competencies in the executive committee so that each member can work in a particular area".
"And I'm going to give hard-hitting assignments to keep football moving a mile forward in each of these segments".
"Many people would probably not be happy because it would start to work really hard and not just criticize the work of others", he added.
He said that because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he was considering not running again.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that I will not have people who will constantly kick my feet and question my every move", he explained.
"But a lot of people told me not to give up because others would".
"It's a trust I can't just throw away", he said.
He says he's motivated by continuing the work he started with Hash.
"There's been a lot of work done in those two years, and I don't want to waste it now".
"There are processes that are underway that will be heard in a few years, and I would not like to be stopped", he said, fearing that if another candidate Miroslav Peltha were elected, the situation in the union could go back to the days before Haš.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelta knows".
"He's primarily tied to people who would play football to be the chosen ones".
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not for leaving".
"I try to be objective.
"I want to play football for everyone, because then everyone will be fine, not just the chosen ones", said Reichl.
He also denies claims that he was only the Czech president.
"Even though some people try to say otherwise, I plan to do the best for Morava".
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian divisions, the winners of which would go to the first league".
"There would be no such situation at the moment, with only three Moroccan teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia", said Rajchl.
Since the president's race has been won by the head of the Pagan Club, Tomáš Paclík, Reichl is not afraid to estimate his chances of being elected.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech House, which elected me as its vice president and sees that I have clear successes behind me", said Rajchl, who considers his successes to be saving tens of millions of crowns on unprofitable contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating a lottery law.
On the contrary, he takes it as complicity that the union does not pull a rope.
While he claims that Pelt is "disqualified from restoring confidence in Czech football", he considers Paclik's opponent a strong candidate who has football to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzeň that year".
"If elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hashek started here and not change the staffing of the commissions in any way".
"He wouldn't want to twist it to his advantage", rivals rated Reichl.

When Iris Meder went on a tour of the world for the past year and a half, her suitcase was not to be missed: her swimsuits.
Leaning on a sign on the water, she looked up into the artificially shaped domes, swam in front of the marble puddles (stations of a little naked boy, a child (with wings)), waiting for her on the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored seawalls.
If she liked a floating factory, she took it to her notebook in a moment - including remarkable details about the building's construction and history.
More than 200 floating-point works have been explored in this way by the architectural historian Meder and are now presented in his newly published book "Badefreuden (The Joy of Swimming) ": People's Floating-point in Munich, Historic Floating-point Palace in Schwarzwald, "The Hard Core of Concrete Buildings" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited sites in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true lover of sailing culture.
Sports are not too much to ask, says Meder - just water is different.
The only thing to be upset about is that fans of swimming have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can breathe in the stinking smell of scrub forests or listen to the cheerful whistling of birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools always have to be so ugly", says Mrs. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice floating floats".
Water levels double architecture
Scuba diving in a jumping pool and essential oils for sauna - the well-being factor is so great that it affects all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the plumbing can be a real eye-catcher: "The floor is in the bathroom water level".
"It's transparent on the one hand, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building on the other".
Everything is optically duplicated: high-heeled, colorful tiles, jump boards.
The 190-page, small-format picture book "Badefreuden" provides everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historic oasis of Wellnes - but above all, it makes you want to jump to the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by a collector of floaters, Mrs. Meder, in her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful thermal baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi in Budapest, she found nitrogen-containing water in the original Kras cave (a desert bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Wárosi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
A wonderful view, on the other hand, is provided by many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria, whereas the city is in the eye of the beholder from the Curry terrace swimming pool, the outdoor pool of the St. Anton spa can be seen by the snow-covered Arlberg - and: The steam bathrooms have a window from which to watch the movement on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits Längenfeld's spa guests: the Ötztal Aquarium looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
Steam rises from three open basins in winter while the sky is blowing up against the background of Ötztal mountains.
Alhambra in the Schwarzwald
Not every swimming pool collector had Mrs. Meder's chlorine smell in the fluff.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, but Árpád baths in Békescsab, Hungary, smell of hot oil to the point where one can hardly believe that he has entered the spa.
The smell comes from a healing water containing alkaline hydrocarbons, which is almost black and whose sediments stick to the skin as soon as you enter the pool - a somewhat peculiar wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate baths of Luhačovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902, the baths designed by architect Dusan Jurkovic were closed.
As Mrs. Meder looked through the collapsing red-white-yellow windows of the intersection building, she saw weeds growing up immensely among the tiles.
The wreck was found in a magical floating shop in Schwarzwald, on the other side of the river, at the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths have already been built in three stages; one can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements dating back to their creation in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, which was added around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been a favorite spa spot for swimming pool expert Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because she comes from Schwarzwald.
"It is a feat to combine such diverse building blocks into such a beautiful complex", says Mrs. Meder.
In such a palace, diving into a thermal pool is obviously a marginal matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank has the commodity trade checked
I 'm not a Christian Teevs .
Is Deutsche Bank abandoning its agricultural commodity business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a task force to investigate the consequences of speculation on the poor world.
Then in January, the CEO wants to make a conclusion.
Hamburg -
For federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat or maize, according to one study.
Two thirds of those interviewed even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions exit the trade as the problems of the world's poorest deepen.
This is the result of a survey conducted by Forsa, commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that global commodity exchange bets drive prices up and banks are therefore complicit in the global problem of hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically aimed at Deutsche Bank's CEO Joseph Ackermann, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also acting similarly.
Commodity betting was originally designed to insure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, most experts agree that capital market participants with an interest in high-risk trading have turned away from supply and demand - and made profits at the expense of the poorest.
Other than competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann's criticism: He promised to check the outlets and said that no deal "was worth betting on Deutsche Bank's good reputation".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the International Working Group is monitoring the foodwatch-report extract.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, after which the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Board - together with a recommendation on how to implement it.
By the end of January, the bank's board of directors will announce the implications.
The end could be a reduction in the commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working on his image with his own help.
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the report but also sharpened his criticism of the financial sector: "The rise in food prices is a particularly stark indication of how ruthlessly banks are damaging the general welfare today".
Let Ackermann as the top bank lobbyist take his duties.
'Deutsche Bank must cut all items in its portfolio that use money to bet on food prices,' Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with the starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank".
Ackermann's insight may seem surprising at first glance, but it's clear that the CEO, months before he leaves office, would like to leave a perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Chairman of the Board will not be joining the Supervisory Board, unlike planned.
By deflecting from the controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about any losses - he should eventually deal with his successor.
Any other person would have said no to investing in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to keep a high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, the Bode released a survey in which the Force Institute interviewed 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 11% consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments linked to food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they knew that their bank was involved in such transactions: One second would have to cancel any investment where money flows into commodity speculation as a result of the survey.
43% would warn known banks of such a bank, 49% said they would consider terminating their accounts and moving to another institution.
21st Century House in Vienna
Moving pavilion
The following is the list of the Member States' official languages:
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and empty.
It's now reopened as an exhibition house.
When it's hot for modern postwar architecture, for clear shapes, glass halls, bold scales and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer's pavilion for the 1958 World's Fair in Bruges is a fine and famous example.
At the time, Schwanzer's pavilion won the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight, high-performance steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a landmark of modern architecture.
He made his name by building the Austrian pavilion for the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-wheeled BMW Palace plus a key to the Munich side-building, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its temporary exhibition building, the pavilion designed after the World's Fair, was placed in the Schweizer Garten near the Vienna Südbahnhof (Southern Station), reconstructed and opened in 1962 as the Museum of the 20th Century - it was named the "House of the 20th Century".
But the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no climate to suit.
It was still used until modern art found a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has been growing more and more.
Now renovated by architect Adolf Krischanitz, the pavilion is now called the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a contemporary art museum in the future.
On Tuesday night, the Museum Belvedere, which is part of the palace, will open its first exhibition - a happy intention in every way.
A new beginning has been announced for Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Belvedere Gallery of Austria in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a prominent art historian with a distinguished career, including as a sculptor in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, promoted major reconstruction among politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the Fritz Wotruby Sculptor's works should be exhibited by the Foundation of the same name, a cafe and a bookstore should be established, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was then the ideal casting.
Not only did he delicately reconstruct and expand the Joseph Olbrich roadworks in Vienna and win the competition, but he also studied at the Technical University of Vienna with Schwanzer, and the pavilion was "an extremely important place" for him to view the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design and also the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and ease when it was moved to Vienna and changed use.
The current reconstruction had far greater problems: The building was "a catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The glass façade window profiles were replaced, glass fibres were used, and the glass roof was replaced with a special safety glass.
Cold steel-bearing bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two underground floors provided space for new use, a lighting channel between the building and the street provided lighting, a bridge led to the entrance - almost a new building but still the elevated Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion red-brown tint.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it was before.
And all this under strict supervision of the memorial office and a low budget.
"Often, material must have been found that is good and cheap and also liked by the monument office", says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstructions, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was said to be difficult with the pavilion, "which came here from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a typical "drop-in-the-city-history".
Such architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place" and yet "want to be self-confident".
In this case, however, the 21st Century House is not in the wrong place, as an urban accident has taken place: a completely newly designed "Urban Quarter at the Main Station" with office and residential buildings is being built around the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another lucky coincidence: a 21st century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, because collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as they say, is already negotiating with the city a neighborhood in a Swiss Garten tent.
The road is planning a multi-million dollar winter crisis package
The road has developed a crisis plan to prevent train outages in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It's going to cost millions.
In the fight against winter-related train outages and delays, Deutsche Bahn is issuing a further €70 million this year, according to a newspaper report.
The report was published by Bild, citing the internal plan of the group, which claims that the total investment is expected to be around EUR 300 million by 2015.
It is said to be used to improve the use of trains and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
It is said that, among other things, there are plans to double the number of internal and external staff per 16 000 people to remove snow on railway installations and platforms.
The objective is to remove the platforms until they are operational and 90% of the necessary bends to operate during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of the railway company, Rüdiger Grube, warned after a high-level meeting with government and industry officials that train outages and delays would occur during this winter.
The route had considerable problems in passenger transport during the last winter, due, inter alia, to a lack of reserves in difficult weather conditions.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval by the Federal Railways.
In addition, there are delays in the departure of ICE trains.
The railway has also been unable to control the fact that ICE train repairers must have their workshops checked more often after the repair was destroyed on one ICE train at the Cologne main station.
Deutsche Bank is paying a million in fines in the US
After the riot surrounding boss Joseph Ackermann, there are new trampolines in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of dollars in damages.
As if Deutsche Bank didn't have enough problems at home, its US history caught up with the giant: the Frankfurt institution is paying out $145 million in one settlement to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's a mortgage sale.
The NCUA's financial market regulator accuses a number of large banks of misleading cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they are likely to have reduced risks.
These papers lost a lot of value during the crisis and drove the banks into a slump.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without having to drag the parties to court", said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt by settlement.
The same goes for Citigroup, which pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the warm welcome of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the United States and assists with bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
NCUA is seeking compensation for the billions of dollars of damages.
The settlement now completed is the first of its kind.
The regulator also took on other big banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs this summer.
The questionable mortgage notes are called Mortgage-backed Securities.
They're based on bank loans.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, it caused the downfall of a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-based investment bank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Even though the events happened a few years ago, a strong wind is blowing in the banks' face.
Investors and supervisors have lodged numerous lawsuits seeking correction or to correct the error.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
It reports to 18 major international banks that two US state-owned real estate investors, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have disadvantaged their mortgage transactions worth about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also faces FHFA's action, involving several transactions totaling around $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The Authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be liable for 'substantial losses' without, however, providing an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the request as unfounded and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
The financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he's bought more than $10 billion worth of stock.
So far, the leading American investor Warren Buffett has always said he won't invest in IT and computers because long-term growth in companies is only predictable with difficulty.
But now he's read IBM business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand earlier that IBM primarily offers services and buys computer systems for other enterprises' IT departments.
Warren Buffett's investment in the financial world is considered a knight fit.
As a result, the IBM motherboard is now called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett revealed on the US economic radio station CNBC that he had bought IBM stock for $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5% stake.
Buffett said that even IBM didn't know anything about his involvement yet.
He praised the management for trying to make even decent returns during the economic crisis.
"You did a great job", Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long been committed to lucrative IT services like running data centers.
A pioneer of computers for more than 100 years, he also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for businesses.
Buffett has avoided tech companies to this day.
It claims to invest only in companies whose activities it also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for freight railroads, lubricants, or machine tools.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a number of large corporations, including Coca-Cola and Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück, in addition to some 80 owned subsidiaries.
An 81-year-old man took over a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s and made it one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet, his lifestyle is modest.
That's why he's a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost flawless sense of making money earned him the nickname "The Omaha Oracle".
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM stock rose by one percent before the stock market began.
Big Blue, also known as IBM, has a market capitalization of over $220 billion and is considered, along with Apple and Microsoft, the most valuable technology company in the world.
At Microsoft, as much as Buffett, he wouldn't want to go.
Bill Gates, the founder, is said to be a close friend of his.
The threat is tangible
After the revelation of the Zwickau Cell, Turkish media have questioned the German rule of law.
The newspapers even talk about a "bloody ideology" that is now coming back to life.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 were of right-wing extremism.
The report was met with fear and alarm in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, this brings back a horror that was long thought to be dead: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to that of a right-wing extremist background.
There was never any doubt that xenophobia existed in Germany.
But the right-wing extremist network discovered reveals a scale that has long been out of sight.
"Is bloody ideology alive again?" were the headlines of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police officer of the Constitutional Protection Unit and fears that the German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted with caution: It recalled the weekend of the protest by silencing the victims of racist violence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, the life together was staged as a success story.
The news of several Turkish media outlets is a box here: "Germany's Gift to the Fifties" is the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
The publication of the Hürriyet for Germany cannot be taken without this thought-connection.
"It's starting to smell", says the title of a column by Ahmet Kulaht.
It emphasizes that people who paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany were murdered.
The most critical discussion is in the German-Turkish Internet forums of the police's conduct and its late success in the search.
Why did it not occur to the German authorities much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Many are at least rhetorically quick to use drastic means: "If this activity continues to be carried out in such a shallow way, immigrants will have nothing but their own defence and weapons".
"That's probably the best defense".
"The quality of the clarification and the proportionality of the punishment of the entire network is very much a matter of internal peace in Germany", writes Selen.
Which means if the internal peace in Germany is threatened, they explain the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the Solingen burning chamber is deeply engraved in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
Because no other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat and the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
But the assassinations have made the Turks feel more connected.
Not Repeating the Mistakes of the Past
The Turkish press was critical of the failure of German policy after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mölln.
After the Solingen fire, he sent a sympathetic telegram to the Turkish president, but was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel at a mourning ceremony in Cologne.
It's like a person's value is measured by their tax bill.
The current Turkish media reports show once again how deeply distrustful many German Turks are of the local legal system.
In addition to efforts to make a broad statement and reassess right-wing extremism in Germany, this time it requires open-mindedness.
Scandal bank by Lake Curice
Europe's most innovative bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered a near-bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to another.
Now some German's gonna settle it.
Axel Weber certainly didn't mean it that way.
After his noisy departure from the management of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: chairman of the board of the Swiss giant UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber enjoyed the public, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and making friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"The UBS has reached a turning point".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But by September, it was clear that things would turn out differently.
A UBS dealer in London has bypassed all the bank's security systems and wasted approximately 1.7 billion euros.
UBS's chief executive Oswald Grübel, not only a well-known banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The president of the UBS board has been a bit of a contrarian ever since, and everyone's asking, when is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has been known that Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And he will assume the presidency of the board in May - not until 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's going to be hard for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, he's a professor of economics and an emissions banker, and he'd definitely need time to work on it.
Then he takes over the responsibility for the bank's strategy, which has just once again proven itself worthy of the title "Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe".
Because UBS is huge -- until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world -- and it's been going from one scandal to another for years.
Nothing, it seems, will keep the proud Swiss bank spared.
It started with the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of a quiet and solid but also clever asset manager combines with ambitious goals: She also wanted to make a difference in investment banking.
So UBS 2007 managed, on the one hand, $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it's emerged as an investment bank into the league of the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a longtime professor of banking in Zurich, relates: "I always referred to UBS as a good bank model for my students back then".
"From today's perspective, the question is, how could I be so wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, it was first apparent that something was wrong at UBS.
In mid-year, the surprisingly successful chairman of the board, Peter Wuffli, resigned, who was still considered a highly intelligent and brilliant banker.
A few months later, he realized why he had left.
The investment division of the bank has lost its subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To keep this going, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
But she did find investors, but one she would have been looking at recently: an opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so discreet that you wouldn't even know its name.
But it was just the first shock.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to admit further billions of losses, and in 2006 the chairman of the board, Marcel Ospel, the second highest paid board in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster ensued: UBS was forced to go bankrupt due to its mistaken investments and had to be rescued by the state.
Nationalbank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs of obliged exchangeable bonds for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - for he saw how dramatic it was for a small country to have such big banks in its territory.
After all, UBS's balance sheet total for 2007 was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
"We could not save UBS again", says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months, UBS had capitulated in a tax dispute with America and had expressed a willingness to release data on wealthy customers who had been able to cut taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a refund of the unauthorized profits from these transactions, including a fine.
UBS has thus more or less openly acknowledged that it has helped to reduce taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in the race for rich clients: the sanctum of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was not what it used to be.
The resignation of the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Board of Directors followed.
And the exodus of customers' money.
The Bank thus lost credibility in the course of several months in both core business areas: investment banking due to poor speculation and asset management to help reduce taxes.
And just as things were calming down a little bit, just as UBS was thought to be recovering, this unfortunate business anabase comes along: The only dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it's clear: with risk management in investment banking, it's still not working out.
"The Adoboli case probably found that risk control had changed too little", says Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor at the Zurich University Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also confident: 'UBS's problem is that it does not control risks.'
Yet this was precisely the idea of caution that Swiss bankers took long ago to become the guardians of the world's great assets: no too great risks, and security for money - on this side too, the Alpine Republic collapsed the world.
Treasuries of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unshakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli have for exceptionally high-quality chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's only a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its head office in Bahnhofstraße, Zurich, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rental of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's is among the traditional Swiss shops like Sprüngli's.
For centuries, it has been the home of Swiss banks, from the Nationalbank to the Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is entered through a heavy rotating door.
Inside are marble-covered walls, facing a huge leather chair, and next to the bank's logo is a large safe.
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
The Swiss bank's idea has been suppressed or betrayed by the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes, as the head of a small private Swiss bank finds out.
He prefers not to read his name in the papers, but he ends up closing, like all Swiss bankers, business with both big banks.
UBS seems to have grown too large, he finds, particularly in investment banking, where the Anglosas have also expanded.
I don't think the Swiss have much to say about that.
"And if they did, they would have adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways long ago".
It was indeed Anglo-Saxon investment banking that UBS transformed, bringing it first high profits and then collapse: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book Der UBS-Crash.
As many as 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, were approved by politicians to save the bankrupt big bank.
How could this happen?
If you're talking to Swiss bankers, they see a problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into a large group.
A bank was born that was already too big for a small Switzerland when it merged - and it kept growing.
It helped by complementing UBS' two different banking predecessors: one rich but dormant bank in Zurich with a wealth management hub and a poorer but more internationally engaged bank.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment bankers came up with a lot of money to spin big roulette with.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future", says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffle, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, a man of the stomach-controlled, who has worked his way up from banking science".
But I hear that the whale was relying on Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli probably made a big mistake in the end: "He probably thought his models were real", says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case".
Tragic, I guess.
Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly recall the executive meetings where CEO Wuffli repeatedly repeated the same slogan: Throw Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She cited "League Tables", a timeline documenting the success of banks at the time.
UBS was trying to get it all up there.
She's already taken a few steps.
She's been in the game from the top of the world in the currency and stock trades.
However, the business advisors who were appointed highlight one weakness: In international interest rate trading, in the words of the "Fixed Income" bankers, there seems to be a great gap behind the largest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS has embarked on an adventure that nearly cost her her existence.
Hungry for growth, they invested both the bank itself and its own hedge fund in U.S. Subprime investments.
It developed into a powerful machine that would repackage securities into U.S. mortgages and transfer them - but also keep the risks to itself.
Even when other banks were looking for a way out.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there", says banking expert Geiger.
The greater the euphoria, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were harder than thought.
The UBS positions have become a catapult seat and they're still hovering.
Whoever runs a big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
He has to find a strategy for the bank that all the nearby business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger has an idea: End investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far.
But investment banking is going to be down sharply, that's all that's clear now.
Next Thursday, the new bank president Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was actually only seen as a transitional solution when the bank unexpectedly split with its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has been pushing for long-term UBS business, the Curry bank said Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats are cut.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's eating it?
What's he trying to make money with?
These are questions Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But so far, he's only publicly saying that he's going to find his mistress an apartment in Zurich first.
- Next year.

Europe is not recovering from recession so quickly, and there are other signs of weakness in banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett just confirmed this vision: He said in a CNBC interview that it might not be clear yet whether Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis.
That's why it's probably too early for him to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned decades-old principles and entered the American tech industry.

Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, wild ravens are considered "problem birds": however, experts say that these highly intelligent animals have long been unable to be ejected from cities.
Some like it, others like to get rid of it quickly: Crowds have been part of the city's image for centuries, yet in some communities residents have mounted complaints about the dirt and noise caused by animals.
Yet, there is no cure for "problem birds" yet.
The raven in the field is no longer likely to be exiled from the cities, experts said at the first raven symposium in Leer, East Africa.
There, experts from across the federal territory consulted on possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in cities.
The problem of cities was also derived from the exodus of particularly protected prairies: the use of chemistry in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
The pursuit, the growing buildup, and the cutting down of typical trees to nest birds make life difficult.
The crows are protected.
Large colonies with over 600 nesting pairs are found in the Westphalian Soest, the northwest, among others in Jevre, Diepholz and Achim near Brem and Leer.
There, in 2005, he sparked a controversial project to mass kill crows in a rural district with a negative headline.
Critics have described the trapping of animals in bird traps and the slaughter of the slaughterhouses as particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, intimidation, brings nothing", so much did urbanist and landscape painter Werner Klöver of Leer.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting down trees often has unintended consequences, said environmentalist Manfred Kaiser of Lahre, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are retreating, the large colonies are breaking apart and dividing into other places".
Scare is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes, or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out of here".
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
It's a thoughtful combination of driving animals out of sensitive habitats and luring them to settle elsewhere.
In contrast, the "information board instead of chain drinks" was promoted by the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, who argued that "with a pinch on the face, we can finally stop being confident".
Ms. Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg Learning Crow Trail, which provides information boards on the life of a highly intelligent wild raccoon.
The project is reportedly already hosting tourists.
Also, when criticizing the noise caused by the bird, Ms. Jürgens had her own opinion: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say".
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: the field hawks not only use tools to achieve their memory, but even make their own tools as a tool.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently tested the behavior of four wild ravens on how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that stones must cause structure to collapse to reach the mole's larva.
Without much training, they figured out what size and shape the stone had to have to cause the plane to collapse.
In the second attempt, the mashed crows then had to solve a more trivial problem.
In a vertical warp, researchers placed a small container with the larva of a mole.
The birds couldn't reach their prey by the tail.
But the researchers put pieces of wire in there.
All four animals made hooks from them, which they used as bait to hunt the container out of the tube.
Three of the four field pigeons even managed to do it with a stake.
Cristiano Ronaldo is shooting Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
The Bosnians and Turks' hopes for the Cup have not been fulfilled.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are taking part in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the last of the European Championship 2012 tickets in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-off matches.
Led by double-winning superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8, 53, Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made their fifth consecutive appearance at the European Championship perfect after a 0-0 draw in the first leg.
The Czechs were good enough in the play-offs against the outsider Black Mountain, with a score of 1:0 (0:0), when the first game was clear.
Croatia failed to score a goal with a 0-0 draw against Turkey, while Ireland scored a free-kick 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) scored more goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional from the Bundesliga, Zvjezdan Misimović, turned penalty kick (41) and captain Emir Spahic (65) have been reduced twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was awarded a yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia has already failed in the 2010 World Cup play-offs in South Africa against Portugal.
Portugal's pace start has arrived at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo quickly gained the lead by hanging a free kick about 30 meters from the net.
A good quarter later, Nani showed his skills in long range shooting and adjusted his 25m strike to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who didn't play in the first half, got their first clear shot at goalkeeper Edina Dzek.
The former England Wolfsburer, who was the manager of Manchester City, placed the ball at the bottom of the penalty box, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
Finally, he was in the center of the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
After the operation against Helder Postig in Bosnian penal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card.
On the opposite side, Stark executed a controversial execution after Fabio Coentra's action, which he certainly turned Misimovic into.
But after a break, the 2004 European vice-champion made it clear with four strikes.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended his last doubts in the 81st minute.
With this, the 1976 European champion is leaving for the fifth consecutive European Championship.
However, the men's team of Michael Bilk, Bundesliga manager Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1st FC Norimberk) were also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the early stages.
The goalkeeper Petr Čech reflexively prevented Tomáš Sivok (9.) from scoring at the last minute.
Black Mountain had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired a 40 minute turn from the border of the criminal zone just outside the Czech gate.
After the break, the striker had to save the place of the already knocked out world-class Czech goalkeeper, again reduced the FC Soul striker (50).
The gate just before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb at that moment.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not overtake 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink must almost certainly clear his place on the bench for the 2002 World Cup, Croatia is happy to be in the final round of the European Championship for the fourth time.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maxim's Stadium, the Turks should experience a fairy tale start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the bar with a long shot in the seventh minute, and the attacker Kazim could not hang the ball in the gate.
After this terrible second, Croatia took over more and more control.
After the break, the Croats didn't get the gate.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice of VfL Wolfsburg, who had released Ivan Perisice of Dortmund from the 62nd minute, the German league's Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were also in the action.
Trapattoni is going to the European Championship
In Dublin, Ireland celebrated their first European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had managed a 4-0 lead in the first game before the preliminary decision, to the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57) settled for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy got his first good shot.
Only at the last minute did the Estonian defense prevent a possible leader of the defense.
But in the 32nd minute, it was a long way off.
After the unsuccessful defence of goalkeeper Paul Londak, Ward was on the ground and pushed the ball across the line to a 1-0 lead.

The personal level massacre
Peter Englund's emotionally powerful new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a long list of characters that turns your head.
One tip for how to handle this moment: Carefully pull this page out and make a backup.
You will get to know all the characters very well in Mr. Englund's novel, and this list will serve as a navigation - a kind of beacon - at times when you, like the men and women in the story, will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new vice-president of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite accurately, as "antihistorical work".
It contains several very well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, but it almost misses ambassadors, energy journalists, and discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is not a book about what happened, but rather, as the author explains, "a book about what it was like".
"Beauty and the Bold" combines the war experiences of 20 more and fewer men and women on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others will become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go insane or die.
Their lives are burning like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones being added to the web of destinies while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is different from classic historical novels.
It corrects the notion that World War I was just a terrible trench warfare on the Western Front.
"Beauty and the Bold" also explores other places where war dramas have taken place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book deal with problems by falling into a beehive, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of a pyramid, or facing the presence of much tsetse.
It's been a very touching read almost from the beginning.
War will swallow up people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling like gunpowder.
If gunfire starts in the distance and you're a woman who's home with her children, will you run or stay?
Who's coming up?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why the whole war was started.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts", noted Mr. Englund, "was filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors".
Beauty and Sorrow follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German navy.
Their stories are entirely taken from biographies, letters, and other published material.
Their descriptions of their lives may sound scary and intriguing, but thanks to the inclusion of minute moments and details, they are absolutely vivid and believable.
Many of them are about suffering and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Extras, substitutes everywhere".
"Coffee loads, aluminum imitations, rubber imitations, paper bandages, wooden buttons".
He goes further and describes the food substitutions in Germany.
It refers to 'meat made from sliced rice cooked in sheep's fat (and supplemented with fake wood bone), tobacco from dried roots and dried potatoes, shoes with wooden soles.'
It states that there were '837 registered meat substitutes for sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes'.
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American finds in himself an inner impulse to savagery and brutality, and he declares of war: "You will eventually understand that this is human nature, not sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, or evening newspapers or a good book, and pretending that this mask represents civilization and that behind this scratchy self there is no barbarian".
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will notice, let alone grieve.
"When one finally comes to terms with the sacrifice, one would at least expect it to happen before the eyes of a grateful audience", he writes.
Instead, he feels like a "convict who is secretly hanging".
Other comments concern the departure of the old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic competition and a competitive struggle", writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories".
He captured what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically-pledged mass murderer in peace-cut clothes who is doing his bloodshed without getting up from the table".
People act completely unexpectedly, evil is replaced by heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a sexually transmitted disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving in the line.
"The most egregious example of this behavior was the trade in gonococcal dung, which soldiers bought and used to wipe their genitals in the hope of getting hospitalized", he writes.
"The most desperate people would stick it in their eyes, often blinding them for the rest of their lives".
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr Englund's prose is blunt but not very elegant, which fits his human subject perfectly.
In dozens of minor productions, he documents how the war "dissolved the forces beyond control: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to ask why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I often worked with hints rather than complex narratives, such as "World War I and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels like "Relax on the Western Front" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr Englund prefers the unconventional concept.
His book has the most overwhelming ending in popular science literature.
But I'm not gonna tell you.
But you'll feel like the author jumped out of a book, pulled a page off your hero list, and set it on fire.
After the previous mistake, this time a minute-to-minute, precise raid.
Hundreds of police officers took part, some wearing armor used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park should be almost empty at that time.
No one knew about the action except a few high-ranking officers, and the others were told it was a drill.
The event was headed by Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted the many problems the police department faced during the operation.
There should be no repeat of cases in recent weeks where pepper sprays were used against demonstrators, violating the rules of the department and, moreover, a wave of public sympathy was poured into the squatters' side.
Thus, a police operation to clear the Zuccotti Park of demonstrators was launched after two weeks of careful planning and training.
Leaders were inspired by the operations in other cities.
A massive emergency behavior exercise was held in Randalls Island in preparation for the Zuccotti Park action.
Leaders have stepped up so-called riot suppression training - counterterrorism measures involving the rapid relocation of large numbers of police officers - with a focus on the Lower Manhattan area.
The last part of the training was on Monday night, on the East River side of Manhattan.
The orders to move into the park came "at the last minute", said someone who was originally interpreted as "exercise".
"I know a few police officers who were also called to the scene, and they certainly weren't told they were going to Zuccotti Park", said the person who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
"Only the highest-ranking members of the department knew he was going to Zuccotti Park".
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had already learned.
On October 14, city officials were scheduled to clean up the park, but then they backed off because as soon as the protesters heard about it, hundreds of them rushed into the park before the operation began.
Tuesday's action was attended by police from various units, including task forces from around the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to reinforce neighborhoods with higher crime rates.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day, large numbers of people come and go to the park, so one hour at night was the perfect time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when the park was as few as possible", he said.
Before the units left, they lined up at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, emergency vehicle trucks with arc lamps and amplifiers.
The lights and the recorded message bursting from the amplifiers frightened many demonstrators.
When members of the security forces entered the park in their blue windshields, many demonstrators packed their bags and left.
Police say she didn't touch a tent until 1:45 a.m., giving the protesters time to pack.
Other teams of police were seen gathering at the edge of the park to break in if any arrests were necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police Department chief spokesman Paul J. Browne claimed that it was for their safety.
Many journalists, however, believe that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing their troops in action, and that some police officers were harsh.
Mr. Browne claimed that the TV cars on Church Street leading along the western boundary of the park could film without any problems.
Police were moving westward, intertwining a large amount of the protesters' personal belongings, including bags and bags of plastic bags full of clothing, and the hygiene department teams immediately picked up everything that was left in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move were pulled out of the park, and documentary footage appeared shortly afterwards on the Internet.
The most well-to-do group of protesters took refuge near the kitchen at their camp, which was near the center of the park.
Some have set up a barrier and police have begun their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp joined each other.
And two people tied to a tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said that about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were made because of "organizing riots and resisting arrest", he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the police department's commander, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the department's detectives, also personally participated in the operation.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "was not involved in the operation", Mr. Browne said.
The second group of officers was waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to call her.
Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south of the park, were fenced off.
From these places, the police developed a protective belt further from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police were spotted, many of them shielded, pushing people even further beyond the border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., a demonstrator south of Pine Street was spotted jumping off the hood of a police car, and several others were released from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of a shovel flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one policeman and one protester were hospitalized.
The union of assistant workers will sue the city for release
Unions representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The court order is probably the last option left for the unions in District Council 37 to try to overturn the dismissal decision.
On October 7, 6,722 school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees who were among the city's worst paid employees lost their jobs, and their dismissal was described by union leaders as a retaliation to the city for not giving him access to the workforce-managed health care fund last spring, which the city was trying to fill a budget hole.
The city has categorically denied the accusation.
At a city council meeting last month, Education Secretary Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget approved in June.
One member of the Council immediately countered by not mentioning in the budget the dismissal of assistants.
District 37 City Council officials announced they had completed the required documents and warned the Department of Education that they would sue him, and they are convening a press conference on Wednesday to formally announce the lawsuit at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiff will be eight dismissed employees, all African-American or Hispanic, as well as most other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city has not yet seen the lawsuit, and therefore will not comment on the individual charges.
According to a complaint obtained by the New York Times, unions targeted the number of people being dismissed in poor areas of the city, supporting their claims of unfair treatment, saying poor schools have lost more staff because they have been denied sufficient funding for a long time.
They point out that while schools on Staten Island were not dismissed at all and only a small portion of the Upper East Side, in Brooklyn, District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants were laid off, and District 8 and District 9 in the South Bronx even laid off 46 assistants.
He recalls that five of the eight assistants at Public School 36 in Harlem lost their jobs, even though it is a school where 68 percent of the students live in poverty.
Public School 36's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated bonus funds for every poor student enrolled.
The boards claim, inter alia, that the principals of secondary schools could have been confused by the way the document approving the dismissal of the parental coordinators was written.
The document used the word 'excess' to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school payroll to a database of available staff whose salary is paid by the central authority.
'Sixty-six parental coordinators have been dismissed,' the complaint claims, 'and not merely moved to a database of available staff positions.'
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept an agreement on the situation in Libya.
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are finally agreeing on something about the Libyan uprising.
But before that happened, the revolution had to succeed, long-ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the involvement of US forces had to end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will decide on a statement endorsed by President John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.) to congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and thank the U.S. forces for their "courage".
"With this statement, we want to acknowledge the courage of the Libyan people who have begun to rebuild their country", Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts".
Those sentences may seem innocent, but no debate about Libya has been easy until now.
Over the summer, lawmakers on both sides have consistently debated with each other and the White House the wording of a series of declarations approving or rejecting the United States' military role in NATO's mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the House because of differences in opinion between the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that the House rejected the proposal, the House also rejected measures to stop funding U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission in Libya was literally in a legislative purge -- Congress criticized the way President Obama was running the mission, but his members apparently didn't bother enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
The Congress's zeal eventually preceded other events.
The rebels took Tripoli in August and on October 20 Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission on International Relations in its statement "congratulates the people of Libya on their extraordinary courage and admirable tenacity in their efforts to liberate their people" and "commends the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies who have taken part in the operation to protect the Libyan population for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism".
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new proposal receive the full support of the Commission for international relations, or will the legislatures be split in half again, as they were when the June proposal was adopted?
The latter version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the Republican Party's chief commissioner.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday he hasn't seen the final version of the new proposal yet.
The House is going to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the top legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by Bob Goodlatt (Va), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on a budget or other subject to be voted on by the whole House or the Senate.
The other legislators have so far, despite considerable efforts, failed to push their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the Constitution that were introduced in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same motion was introduced in the House and Senate - and others are just minor changes to others.
In the House alone, there are at least 15 versions of the Balanced Budgetary Amendment and a handful of others that would like to "regulate federal spending".
While some of the proposals are identical, their supporters - especially the Republican startups seeking to improve their reputations - can boast of their "authorship".
The budgetary adjustment report, which was approved in August, required the House and the Senate to vote on the balanced budgetary amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration in support of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss limiting the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of terms that can be served as president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of amendments that would guarantee the right to quality education and medical care, among other things.
The amendment banning same-sex marriage and the burning of the flag remain a permanent proposal.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
While members of Congress seem to be very active in proposing various amendments, they are not significantly off the average compared to previous years.
In the 111th Congress, they proposed 77 amendments, while in the 100th Congress, there were 66.
Their activity is even pale compared to the early 1990s, when, according to Senate Library statistics, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
But they were not much more successful than the politicians of today.
The last amendment that was added -- the 27th amendment -- was ratified in 1992, but it was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Shit, but not defeated", Gifford says in her first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after being shot at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Arizona, Gabrielle Gifffords appeared on national television Monday night, sang a song from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow", and declared that more than returning to Congress was needed to heal herself.
Giffords appeared on ABC News's "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, and it was apparent that she was still having trouble making sentences and needed help walking.
The entire series documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary because of a bullet wound that pierced her skull in the front, penetrated her left hemisphere of the brain, and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, she came back to the House unexpectedly to participate in the debt ceiling vote.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very well".
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hour-long special "20/20", which aired on the eve of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
Special has been watching Gifford's entire recovery since the January 8th shooting.
In the videos Kelly filmed during the first few weeks, Giffords is seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar all over her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can only lift one or two fingers during that time.
A few months later, Giffords is spotted in a wheelchair, and a therapist is teaching her how to perform simple tasks.
Bowing his head.
Lips are swollen.
And then, her first word, "What".
Within days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast" - when she demanded changes to her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a key role in Giffords' recovery: a congresswoman sings along with a therapist on the melody of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
During an interview with Gifford, who spends two hours a day in therapy, Sawyer revealed that she remembers nothing about the day the shooting happened.
Her husband said Gifford read the newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12th, when she first asked him who the sixth woman who was killed in the incident was.
The shooting is the case of suspect Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a Missouri prison where he is awaiting trial for drug overdose.
"A lot of people died", Giffords told Sawyer.
"Horrible, horrific, horrific".
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point during his recovery, his wife said, "I lost".
"So I said to her right away, Gabby, you didn't lose", Kelly described.
"You just got a slap.
But you can do it, you can put yourself together, and you'll come back stronger than ever".
Military units are met with more compassion than respect
The event was a gala on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for war veterans in New York City who have no roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines ran around him.
The crowd dressed in solemn clothes rose up and applauded enthusiastically.
"The men and women who served in the military were considered heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
The ceremony was attended by the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military forces in a slightly different way.
"They were all presented as some kind of orphans", the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought it right.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respect, it was pity.
So the very opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the often moderate, sometimes celebratory American public.
The military is unabashedly involved in praising its victims.
But this praise is worth something, soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting like a person in uniform is regretting it.
"We are not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commands troops in Iraq and will soon be leaving Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls".
This is a very sensitive subject for military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or ruin their relationships with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger they had to face when returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most words of remorse are spoken in silence and in private among veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from military service as members of the Marines, their father warned them that their service would be viewed from two angles by those outside the military.
From the perspective of some, he will feel respect and awe because they defeated the enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
But others will be worried if "an evil, violent veteran is not hidden beneath the surface", said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to Washington to take a seat in the government.
He claimed that while he was looking for work, some people who interviewed him had subtly suggested that he could resist the stress of working in Washington so soon after returning from the war.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions", Cancian taught his sons.
The military's concern is partly due to American indifference to war.
Battlegrounds rarely have gained recognition in a country that has little knowledge of its own military and finds little self-interest in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it was during World War II", said Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition of politicians and the public is focused on the suffering of gunmen.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military faces increasing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, it's decided whether to start a trial of 28 women and men against the military for alleged inaction in the rape case.
If not, they're ready to sue hundreds of other plaintiffs.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old on the night she was allegedly raped by her army colleague and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It was in October 2008, and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego, and after dinner with a friend, she came across a male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join him, so they could have a drink in her room.
"I had a warning light in my head", Lyman wrote.
But the native Texan ignored her objections altogether.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"She's from Texas", she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts".
She claims that just minutes after they entered her room, a man came over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the military will await a verdict of hearing that could have historic implications, taking place in Arlington, Virginia, to determine whether the charges against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The indictment alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to fight the spread of rape in the military, which violates the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charges were filed in February by Washington attorney Susan Burke, who was 17 at the time, but within the next few months the number grew to 28 to 25 women and three men, all of whom claimed to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military and that the military failed to investigate, punish and pursue justice after the attacks were reported.
Burke says he's going after the highest-ranking military commanders because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a directive system", he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent an attempt to impose measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of further lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than rounding up all the charges in this case - putting all the eggs in one basket, as she says - she'll sue in more than one case, if pressure doesn't drop.
The Department of Defense defense team is led by United States Attorney Neil MacBride, who, along with his associates, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy - in principle, that current or former soldiers cannot sue the military for injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court ruling known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active duty soldiers.
"The alleged injuries relate to the plaintiffs' military service", the document says.
The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it's just a wording: in modern warfare, it's hard to find a clear front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers have played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers were killed in the war, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time to modernize the military, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, but there are three other lawyers who handle the case.
Yale Law School's Veterans' Legal Services Seminar is preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly fostering an atmosphere of hatred of women.
The nonprofit organization of American Vietnam Veterans is collecting evidence for its lawsuit against the military, which seeks to diagnose "personality defects" allegedly detected in rape victims so that the military can justify their release - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Human Rights Fighters Service Women's Action Network, a common practice.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the State Veterans' Organisation, which it accuses of discriminatory practices in handling requests for assistance from persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both political parties and proposed a number of remedies.
According to the Department of Defense's Office of Sexual Violence Prevention and Resolution, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, these types of attacks remain largely unreported, and the Pentagon's own estimates put the figure at about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
The March report also discusses the rate of prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to court - half as many as the civil justice system.
Plaintiffs in the case of D.A. Burke describe the attacks as just the first in a series of trauma.
For example, first-class soldier Lyman reported an alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it was supposed to have happened.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape 11 times to various police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She did all the tests necessary to determine the rape, and the blood of the assailant was found in her bed from the wound she gave him on the arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was on trial, where she was asked questions about whether she had sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six men were summoned to testify as reputed witnesses in favor of the alleged offender, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down", says Lyman.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there - I ran out of the courtroom screaming".
"I was placed in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer, 'That wasn't his trial.
The Lymans ordered a military psychiatrist to see her, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was discharged from the army without honour and therefore without the right to a hearing.
Whether or not the Lyman and other plaintiffs' case moves to the next stage, it's a long road, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes, "from my point of view, they should be able to move on to the next stages of negotiation".
But between them and the verdict stands the doctrine mentioned, which has been criticized since it first saw the light of the world.
I myself have been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because their duties do not provide the same level of motivation and deterrence.
He adds: "The odds are tough on them... but it's important for them to try".
Change will only happen if good people are willing to fight.
If no decision is reached in their favour at the hearing, Burkevoá, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather hundreds of other persons prepared to file a complaint and begin work on further cases related to the matter.
"We will not stop fighting with the military on this issue, where reform will not come from", he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How scientists are examining you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who was presenting his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murderous outrage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was definitely not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how do we find them?
It's easy - just go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting them wasn't really that hard", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report by a British research team on European digital populism.
The amount of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, Bartlett says, that it was enough for scientists to simply use advertising on the site to pinpoint the demographic they were looking for with absolute accuracy - something that marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe, and they focused their attention and sent them ads, but instead of inviting them to join a new group or offering them some dietary products, they asked them to fill out a questionnaire that asked questions about their education level, their relationship to violence, and their optimism about their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It's a whole new way of doing research", notes Bartlett.
Some of the results are not surprising: online right-wing supporters are all young men who are encouraging the rising immigration rate.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain hidden behind a computer screen".
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and policy researchers use this site to study everything from health issues to social trends, including status updates, posts on walls, and clicked "I Like It".
Facebook reports over 800 million active users, each of whom provides on average three different data points per day, making it literally an "information supernova" that is behind a lot of new research.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it allows them to study people without having to bother them on the street.
"It used to be true that when you wanted to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"You have to get to a party where they'll never let you", Bartlett says.
"Facebook is breaking all this stuff down -- you just go straight to them".
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a social health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that college students who discussed their drinking performance on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who kept quiet about it.
Moren suggests that the peers of the site monitor and offer help to a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"A problem cannot be solved unless you can diagnose it", said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren's book and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We've found a way to identify vulnerable children that we otherwise would not have a chance to detect".
Facebook itself is constantly probing the data of its users.
The site's information team compiled statistics on the relationship between relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in 2010 and the national satisfaction coefficient (mostly using the information they had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make its information treasure available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that they're being followed by a page, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the page needs to provide their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules about how to collect data offline, but online data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most users thought scientists could look at their profiles", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study using his students' public Facebook walls.
"If it was about them, they took it as information between them and their friends".
The methodology question is also considered.
Even in offline research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There's no way to verify on Facebook how much of the information on the profile and the posts on the walls are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things", Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, believes that pencil and notebook are still the best tools for research.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced", he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities -- and a hell of a lot of social activities are still happening offline".
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to staging two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance and among the Norwegian Knights Templar", he declared before a court of 500 people.
"I object to the court because you were given a mandate by organizations that promote the ideology of hate and because they promote multiculturalism".
"I confess my actions, but I do not confess any guilt".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik interrupted during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform from which to express his views".
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who brought a prepared speech with him, permission to speak to the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to detain Breivika for another 12 weeks, forbade him from contacting the media for four weeks, and announced that the authorities would have full control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of the victims and survivors attended the hearing.
Some came in hopes of being able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was kept tightly locked up.
All of them were involved in the process to move the case to early closure.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman", one of the survivors told NRK's commentator.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can tell you that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I went a little further psychologically".
Breivik, wearing a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing, entering and leaving the building without difficulty, with the journalists present and the survivors in sight.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge found him not insane, noting that there was no evidence that he had any accomplices.
For some, it may be comforting to know that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically lessen the sorrow and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she looked like a creature, but she doesn't", said a relative of one of the victims.
"If I did, it would be much easier".
Seven lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobs in a movie coming out this week.
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, opinions began to emerge from people who compared him to Henry Ford -- and chose him for his genius as the greatest modern inventor.
In a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs, which was taped for a special movie coming out this week, for all Apple fans, it will be a fact that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer, and a self-described member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a man who puts every little detail into the details - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "from the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work... [but] there is still a long way to go between a great idea and a great product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumph of Computer Madness, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers.
By this time, it had been ten years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company NeXT, and he was eagerly awaiting the wide public's acceptance of the Internet.
The TV show ended up using only a short portion of Cringle's entire interview, and the original copies of the interview were traded as missing during transportation.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It's this material, slightly cut, that forms the basis of a 68-minute video of Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which is heading to select theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who's famous for not being willing to give lengthy interviews, here Jobs seems surprisingly excited to talk about his technology philosophy and business strategies.
And he also shows himself to be a very thoughtful man.
Four times during an interview, there's a longer pause between question and answer -- 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, when you see Jobs perfectly think through the answer to make it as accurate and as accurate as possible.
There are times when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, when he is impatient with Cringley's questions, and it drives him to get to more important issues and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and it shows terrifyingly prophetic thoughts as Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing right and wrong, offering his own vision for the future of computing.
It's one thing to read a posthumous review of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about Jobs, who we see here as a dream-like man in the prime of his genius.
He has his own vision of what things should and should look like.
It was not long before he began to put his thoughts into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview that are definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
"In my years in business, I've always asked myself, 'Why are you doing this?' and the answer was always the same: 'Well, that's just the way it's done.'"
No one knows why he does what he does, never thinks deeply about business matters.
I found out.
Jobs goes on to describe his effort to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way costs were recorded - they often started with the words "standard costs", and he could only imagine how much they were.
As he did the Pope's roasting:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak -- a device that allowed people to efficiently hack into a phone company and call anywhere in the world for free.
There's been a lot of talk about this device in the past, but Jobs' enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as a tool of power is literally contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a pay phone and were able to get a call from one AT&T network to another using as many satellites as possible.
"But we've been around the world like this half a dozen times, so when we've screamed something into a pay phone, it rang a minute later from the second phone at the door", Jobs laughs.
"We were young and we found that we could build something that could run billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world".
We made a little thing that we could handle a much bigger giant -- it was an incredible experience, and I don't think Apple would ever have made a company without it.
Jobs continues to describe a joke that Wozniak and I almost made, through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, called the Vatican asking if they could talk to the Pope, pretending to be Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, Catholics were called to speak to a U.S. diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before the pope was even called, the couple cheered and set off.
How he fell in love with technology (and called Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and looking for spare parts to build a meter, he found Bill Hewlett's phone number in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Jobs had a secure summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what a company really is and how it should treat its employees".
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
It was a suitcase-sized, CRT monitor, and I instantly fell in love with it.
As a teenager, I went up and down at HP, I wandered around that computer and started writing programs for it.
How he invented innovation:
In a few places, Jobs talks about how he's inventing new products on the go.
Early in his career, when he set out to sell a few flat-band records, a customer asked him to assemble a computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
Later, when he was at Apple, he recalled the problems they faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember we were fighting wildly... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] until I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer".
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15 dollars.
How big companies are breaking out:
Long before he led the Apple revival, Jobs had predicted that many industry leaders would lose their market share.
"Let's say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you make better copying machines or printers, well, what do you do?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be a more successful company.
By this point, there's sales and marketing, so companies are run by people who are in charge of this, while people who are in charge of their own products are being pushed out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that has brought the company to its unshakable position is now being replaced by people who have no idea what good or bad products are - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have literally owned the entire computer industry.
It could be ten times bigger than it is, it could be a Microsoft of the '90s...
But instead of winning, they lost.
How he takes innovation as an art form:
"Between a great idea and a great product, there's a long way to go and a lot of work to do... and as that great idea evolves, it changes and grows".
You will learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to make a whole range of compromises - certain things you just can't force electrons, glass, robots or factories to do.
You have to keep 5,000 things in mind all the time -- different concepts -- and put them together...
And ultimately, it's all about taste -- you try to think about the best things that humanity has ever created, and in a way, you try to reflect them into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
The Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked at it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and, by the way, the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technology, they would have done amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with the health care law opponents during their trial
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to approve an objection to President Obama's health care bill, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner party sponsored by a law firm that will attend the hearing.
The incident occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the proposed amendments.
One of the cases under consideration was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the radical overhaul of health care that Congress passed last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the case, but a 5.5 hour hearing is expected in March, which will further trigger the presidential election scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who stands before the court and tries to get the bill repealed will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the United States Attorney General under George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal advocacy group that has been around for years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the law-calling trade associations, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., for which huge funds are at stake.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court hearing on the matter.
It was attended by, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the health care bill.
And the guest announcement?
It's nothing new: These two judges have been involved in the Federalist Society for years.
And it's definitely not anything that would violate ethics.
In fact, those judges are exempt from the duty to observe the principles of conduct to which the lower federal judges are subject.
However, if they did not, their conduct would certainly fall under Principle C4, which states that 'the judge may participate in actions which are organised by the relevant and other organisations to raise funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an guest of honour or be included on the programme of the action'.
Nevertheless, Scalia's and Thomas' relationship with the two law firms involved in the case, as well as the companies with a huge financial interest in the case, was enough to alert government ethics activists.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct contradicts the claims of several justices that the Supreme Court is acting in accordance with the same rules as all other federal judges", said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and ate a social benefit dinner with the lawyers waiting to hear their case before the court".
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines any claim of indifference, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding of their critics, telling them that they too had no problem combining their judicial duties with the actions of groups like the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
The Conservatives also claim that the ethical issue is primarily Judge Elena Kagan's, not Scalia and Thomas's.
Kagan was the attorney general under President Obama when the first legal objections to the law came to court.
Kagan's critics are pressuring her to withdraw from the case, claiming that she fought so hard for the law then that she can't be interested now.
Kagan has made no sign of resigning.
Boeing has won a record $18 billion jet contract
Emirates is ordering 50 two-wheeled jetliners Boeing 777 with the option of purchasing 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Aman Air, for which it collects more than $1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 of its products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
But if that company is Boeing Co., and the price of these 50 planes is a record $18 billion, that's something else.
Equally important is where Boeing got the contract: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest order in history for a dollar value of commercial aircraft this weekend -- 50 twin-engined Boeing 777.
The sensational order came from Emirates based in Dubai.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airlines would have the option to purchase 20 more aircraft, bringing the total value of the contract to US$26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8, sometimes called Dreamliners, which boast significantly better fuel consumption and passenger facilities.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
"This is excellent news for the entire Boeing company", said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high".
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by the oil-producing nations of the region.
This means that not only do they have the money to pay for planes, but the increase in fuel prices -- which mostly damages airlines because it's one of their biggest costs -- is not so crucial because the country itself makes money from higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to rising fuel prices, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection", he says.
The contract from Emirates strengthens Boeaing's leading position in the wide-body market and puts Airbus SAS at a disadvantage as it attempts to undermine Boeing's dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus officials announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, would be cancelled.
The withdrawal was due to customers' demand for a higher payload and a higher level of flight, so it took the manufacturer time to provide the engine with more engine power.
The share price of Boeing Co. increased by 1.5% to US$67.94.
The Mexican president's sister was apparently defeated in the Michoacan election.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims her opponent, Faust Vallejon of the PRI, was helped by drug dealers in the governor's race.
It appears that Felipe Calderona's sister lost the violent state election for governor of Michoacan, and on Monday, she later stated that one of her opponents had been helped by drug dealers to win.
The preliminary results were attributed to Faust Vallei's leadership in the Western state governorship election by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The interference of organized crime members in the entire electoral process and especially in the election itself yesterday is alarming not only for Michoacan but for our entire country", said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the opinion polling group... they seized polling stations, they built roadblocks... and they let people vote on PRI's bid.
The PRI party ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost the presidency.
But he plans an early return to power, and winning the Michoacan election is an important step in that effort.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
It seems Vallejo has defeated Calderon, who led the day before the election, only very narrowly.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Valleyon as the winner.
The third place was taken by Silvano Aureolis, a candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which until now controlled the governor's office.
Aureoles also refused to accept the provisional findings.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state capital named Morelia, rejects any ties to drug dealers and urges other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacan has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the home state of President Calderon and it was in Michoacan that he launched a military fight against traffickers in December 2006.
But the violence continued.
The PAN mayor, a supporter of Louise Marie Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election and many candidates withdrew from the election for fear.
However the results of the Michoacan election may look to the PRI, a victory will help the party gain new momentum.
The PRI's expected presidential candidate, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Wahington Vallejo and said: "I think this victory could be very encouraging in view of the coming year".
ADB calls on Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be prepared to help rescue the eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be a global downturn that would also negatively impact Asian economic growth.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world's two fastest-growing economies must "do everything in their power" to help the currency bloc recover quickly through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRICS countries [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were watching all European problems "too uninterruptedly" and said that Asian financial aid, combined with European leadership and resources, would help to fuel the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together".
"So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is a good fit", he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's definitely not immune".
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it".
The European Monetary Association has been undergoing a severe debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that the global economy could re-enter recession, and calls have begun to emerge for the newly emerging economies to unite and help the eurozone find solutions.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be directed through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union Financial Aid Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility - would provide greater negotiating opportunities for Asian partners in European countries.
Anand Sharma, India's commerce minister, said that "India will do what it can" to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drought in foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unstable", he said.
"We have a difficult task ahead of us and we must maintain a high growth rate".
"It's not an alternative, it's a bare fact, because otherwise we could find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women".
Others argue that developing economies such as India have little to help European economies when they are faced with their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to explain Europe's aid to India's 1.2 billion people, when 800 million of them live on $2 or less a day.
"One day they might find out that Greeks retire at 50 and take vacation vacations on the beaches, which would be hard for them to explain", he noted.
Lee Howell, Director General of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to keep many Greek citizens in well-paid jobs in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis is threatened by a "dangerous domino effect".
The Bank's forecast for 7,5% economic growth in Asia between 2011 and 2012 now faces a 'risk of decline' due to the European threat.
It stated that vulnerable emerging markets must develop 'unpredictable spending plans' to protect them from a downturn and a significant capital outflow from their economies.
Pentagon Warning of Possible Defense Cutbacks
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta put a big dent in Congress on Monday, warning that looming automatic budget cuts could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefields in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend $450 billion on budget cuts over the next 10 years, but now it fears a further $600 billion if Congress fails to reach a spending deal.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating to the entire resort", Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress's failure to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called stalemate would cause a 23% flat rate drop and the halt of many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this reckless manner, most of our construction or ship projects will not be possible - you can't buy only three-quarters of the buildings or ships, and further modernization efforts could be seriously damaged", Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements".
"These changes can shake the faith of those who care for our military and seriously damage its readiness".
Eventually, the cuts will also affect combat troops, Panetta announced.
"While the accounts for financing possible overseas war operations will not be directly affected by this settlement, those operations will be adversely affected by major changes in other budgets", Panetta warned.
"There will be cuts in contract staff, which will delay the agreed contracts supporting the war effort of our people".
'Workers' wages will be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers and consequent disruption of legal and political support.'
Both senators wrote to Panett ten days ago asking for details about the possible impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of the stay at the Department of Defense could cause a rapid deterioration in the view of the United States as a world military power".
"We are strongly opposed to this tough measure", the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon, when they released Panett's letter.
"This is not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign it".
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow".
"It remains to be seen whether Panett's letter and recent warning will increase the pressure on Congress to approve the budget and increase the votes calling for the Pentagon to be removed from the list of cut areas.
Panetta has been increasingly open about possible cuts lately, even though he himself moved into his senior position at the Pentagon with years of experience in congressional and White House budget approvals, so he knew he was going into a tough fight.
At a press conference held for a minute week, the Secretary of Defense pointed out a brief picture of what his resort might expect - the shell of an army, but inside which there will be no core.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors".
"It'll be like a brigade without ammunition".
"It'll be like an air force without trained pilots".
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained troops to complete the mission", Panetta said at the beginning of his speech at the Pentagon.
"It will be like a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to face a possible enemy".
"As a result, aggression will be welcomed... "
The annex, accompanied by a letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: delayed response to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant limitations on deployment and deployment opportunities worldwide; and the expected unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
Panetta added that some of the largest defence projects could be expected to be completed, including those already undergoing testing and those still in the early planning stages.
The list included, for example, the F35 aircraft, a planned new bomber, a new generation of ballistic submarines, a new coastal warship, and a new land-based combat vehicle that the Army and Marine Corps wanted to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next 10 years, but its supporters say it's a necessary next step in improving the military needed to help the country cope with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize a Lie
A fresh look at recent newspaper headlines reveals how serious and pervasive lies and deceit are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy accusing several women of sexual harassment - both sides claiming the other is lying.
Penn State administrators were accused of perjury in trying to cover up records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on a microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has destroyed entire careers and sealed the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by publishing information that was immediately disproved by undeniable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of misusing campaign finance to try to cover up his unmarried affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that broke up with Bill Clinton when he lied about his sexual orientation with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
There's stories of cheating all over the place, in school and at the university.
There are instances where teachers give their students test answers themselves just to make them look good in their assessments.
Mentors who should teach the reverse send a message that lying and deceit are acceptable.
How many scams are we facing?
Studies show you can get anywhere from 10 to 200 cases in a single day.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of their first encounter.
Detecting lies, or "recognizing lies", is a necessary skill that anyone should acquire, whether for personal or professional reasons.
But it's not a social game that would be like, say, Sharad, where you shout, "I got you".
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars are looking you in the eye.
It's not like they're shaking, or cooking, or red-hot, or sewing.
But don't assume that liars are hard to spot and expose.
A trained lie detector can reveal the truth from the structure of the sentence, the small facial expressions, the way questions are asked and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a vast and growing industry in the field of lie detection, and it is clear that lying is a modern skill that is easy to learn and can be very helpful in today's complex world - especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, conducting interviews, negotiating, or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them be watered in alertness, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other party is receiving them.
Research shows that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies, while women tell more "other-centered" lies - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie to their partners less often than single people (although the lies they tell are usually "horrible").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called "initial observation".
It'll give him a lot of information to compare to later.
Notice the subject's body posture, his laughter, his voice work.
You should know if someone is typically constantly clapping their feet so that you do not unfairly accuse them of lying just because the meeting room is starting to clapping their feet.
Then try to identify the differences between false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But take it only as a warning sign, not as proof of a lie.
Liars may stop moving their upper half of the body as they try to recall their fictitious story, they may shoot the tips of their shoes to the door, bend to the east, significantly alter their posture, or they may show "conversation relief" - exaggerated relaxation and change of position when confessing is difficult.
People who conduct interviews often give a false signal that the interview is over just to see what the relief will be like when it's over.
Also understand the language of the subject.
There's a famous story about how Scott Peterson once recanted and used the past tense to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which sparked a nationwide search for her body.
Lying individuals may also express themselves in a moderate way, "I had no sexual relations with that Mrs. ... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal signs are very minor.
Some may use a lot of "softening language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... to my best conscience".
Such a response will not reveal too much, and it is often another warning sign.
There is no magic that can expose every lie, but it is possible to learn the skills that can help detect lies.
These skills will help a person to avoid being exposed to some kind of liar and fraud in his personal and professional life.
The controversial oil pipeline plan will be re-directed after the threat of delayed approval by the US government emerged.
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - pushing unions against each other but reassuring environmentalists - the company in charge of the pipeline announced that it was willing to redirect the project to get things back on track.
TransCanada announced Monday night that it would move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills region of Nebraska, and is confident the project will be approved anyway.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada's head of sales Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will take a different route.
This announcement came after the State Department announced last week that it was postponing a federal project permit decision from which it would not study possible alternate routes to prevent access to the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the watershed of Ogallala, the vast underground water supply.
"This is really a step forward", Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the Foreign Ministry would likely postpone any decision until 2013, a year after the elections next year, but the authorities deny that politics played any role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed support for it.
A 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From Alberta to the refinery in Texas, they're running 700,000 barrels of oil a day.
This road will have to cross six states.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but it's loved by the labor force, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will be created when they work on the pipeline.
However, Nebraska lawmakers opposed the plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company to not intervene in the Sand Hills region and the watershed of Ogalla, the primary source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing environmental impact study commissioned by the State Department found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but an energy industry source said the inspector general of the Ministry had ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two questions.
Once, it was whether the TransCanada lobbyist, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's adviser in 2008, was not representing a conflict of interest in the program.
The second question is whether the company that was hired for the original study was not chosen incorrectly because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of causing the child to turn away from her fears
A New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle furiously broke into the lobby of their Manhattan home and frightened their daughter to the point that she gave up.
The performance of the hit "Lady Marmalade" so terrified 18-month-old Genevieve Monk that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers", her family said in a lawsuit filed in Manhattan's highest court.
On November 10th last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanne, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were planning a family trip.
When Kevin Monk parked the car, Roseanne Monk got her luggage down to the lobby of their house on Riverside Boulevard and brought Genevieve with her.
Roseanne Monk said she stopped by the door for a moment and put the baby down for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'You know what your daughter's doing?' " I said, 'Yes,' and I went to pick her up".
LaBelle was irritated by the pregnant woman's punishment.
"In an aggressive tone, she said, 'You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,'" Roseanne Monk said.
"I said, 'I don't care what you think.'"
She got angry and started talking stupidly - shouting the simplest of expressions out loud...
She had a bottle of water with her and she started pouring water for me.
He says Genevieve had a hysterical seizure.
"I said to the woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter.'"
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who was still holding Genevieve in her arms - and had to stop her until her escort, who then pulled her into the waiting car, confessed to Roseanne Monkova.
The daughter, meanwhile, was screaming so loud, she turned away, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter apologizing to LaBelle, but they received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokesman are not responding to our phone calls to comment on the case.
The lawsuit calls for more specific damages, but family attorney Sam Davis said the case was taken free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money raised to a charity that works with children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions", Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially when directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child".
The climate crisis has crippled the economy
During the first year of Maria López Valdez's government, Sinaloa experienced an increase in unemployment and unreliability, a decline in foreign investment and, with it, in the economy.
2011 will be a year in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, who calls herself the change government. This government has brought with it high expectations of economic progress, however, due to adverse climatic conditions, no growth was recorded at the beginning of the year and even a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures in February have caused millions of agricultural losses, limited the growth potential of the state economy, and have led to a 3.6% decline in economic activity in the first half of this year, with a historic decline of 31.16% in agriculture, which has also disrupted other economic sectors.
According to the damage report by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% was completely destroyed and 21.07% was partially damaged.
The state's unemployment rate increased during the first three quarters, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography. From January to March, 55,053 Sinaloa residents were unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4,53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5,28% and between July and August, the average unemployment rate rose to 6,19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences at UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly by the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is linked to a number of factors, including the loss of market liquidity due to resource constraints due to legislation passed by Congress on combating money laundering. It is not easy for people who illegally seize dollars to make, invest or use them for anything", he stressed.
Stop the migration
López Cervantes said that a demographic factor was also contributing to the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave to work abroad, to the United States, has decreased, firstly because of the difficulty of entry and then because even if these people get across the border, it's hard for them to get a job, so people stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment is rising", he said.
Unreliability
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is also worsening due to the growing uncertainty that prevails in the field of working conditions.According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed in the state work without paying social security benefits.
Unemployment and unreliability are added to other labour market features such as low wages, which are among the lowest wages in the country, according to the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa State was 5 352 pesetas as of September, well below the national average of 7 375 pesetas.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, 2011 also saw the largest decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years, with foreign direct investment of $630,697 from January to June, according to the Ministry of Finance, a decrease of 87,74% from $5,143,312 in the same period of the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government reports an investment of 17 280 million pesetas a year, which was mainly directed towards services.
Debt
In the context of a recession scenario, the state government asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revive the economy.
Reaction
According to business representatives, the first year of the government of Maria López Valdése pointed to a lack of governmental management capabilities.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transforming Industries, stated that there was a lack of alignment of the will of the various sectors, including the State Government itself, in 2011.
"The economic development in Sinaloa has been really small this year. We have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year. In 2012, we have to double our efforts, we have not harmonized our efforts and especially the proper and synchronized functioning of this new government.
Slowdown in the economy
Loredo López said that events like the freezes at the beginning of the year halted the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"Weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including a freeze, one of the main consequences of which was the slowdown in the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to regain the momentum to allow for an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services.
Redefining the mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed towards more dynamic productive activities.
"We believe that a long-term plan should be drawn up to redefine the objectives and economic direction of the state, because it is important to mobilize all the potential material and human resources that Sinaloa has", he said.
The Work That Is To Be Done
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of setting a vision for the future that would better guide government efforts.
"I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, there has been some progress in economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan", he said.
He stated that the current administration had made progress in public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the government is trying to be friendly, and I can say that there is work being done and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead", he said.
Convicted of 8 kg of marijuana
Resident Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in jail for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General's Office of the Republic has informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, convicted of a crime of health risk, specifically possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by elements of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 while marching on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Station 80 in the district of El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer was driving a white pickup truck with a black bag in the car and a small bag in the driver's seat, and the soldiers found eight kilograms of marijuana.
For these reasons, the man retained by the Judge of the Second Chamber and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Law of the Crime.
Contributions to projects owed
Social projects that are part of programmes like Habitat, Rescue Public Places and 3x1 for migrants face the risk of not being fully funded or of being delayed due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Urban Social Development said that if the construction work had been progressing so far, there was now a risk that the State Government would not be able to secure the relevant supplies requiring funds of more than 11 million pesos for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos, 25% of which is for the state, and that until then only the Federation and the city had provided the funds for the work, so there may be delays in the implementation of the projects.
"We are supposed to secure almost 12 million and even though the year is coming to an end, we have not gotten anything at all, even though we should have gotten a part of it already in July", he said.
He stated that the State failed to meet the relevant supplies during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla last year and that, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan to repay more than 7 million which the State administration did not give them.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six years, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes were going on.
Despite the promise made by the authorities to transfer those resources, it stated that a request was sent to the Secretary of State for Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to expedite the procedure and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
"They were to give us 12 million and even as the year draws to a close, we haven't gotten a single peso yet".
The Court approves the "end of analogue broadcasting" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court of the State (SCJN) rejected a constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that aims to speed up the so-called "deactivation of analog signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juana Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued a decree setting out the individual steps that will lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
The Court of First Instance rejected the action brought by the Senate on the ground that the qualified majority of eight votes needed to give a ruling on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree in question was not reached.
The draft judgment drawn up by Minister Olgou Sánchez Cordero proposes the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, since the regulation of all matters relating to radio and television is a matter which is reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofet), thus violating the principles of hierarchical subordination and the exceptions to the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported a constitutional dispute in an attempt to fight against the decree.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the proposal, which is also the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the proposal that the federal executive cannot structure measures to prepare public administration through general standards.
"I don't think even if she did that would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", he said, noting that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has seen in recent years, with better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that delaying change would mean delaying the benefits of digitisation, which requires decisions in the public interest, since digitisation is not only of a technical dimension but also "concerns economic, social, political and national security issues".
He stressed that these issues "require the operation of the entire system in place, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State.
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital, and through their governments, despite having highly specialized technical bodies at their disposal.
He stated that it was not possible for the government to introduce into the administration of the administration compliance with laws prepared by the legislature by issuing a non-conforming decree that interferes to some extent with the powers of Congress.
In Michoacán, they're analyzing the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to PREP data, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent.
The possibility of counting "voices by vote" appeared in this year's Michoacán election, where, according to data published by the Preliminary Election Result Programme (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent, and 879 votes out of a total of 6074 constituencies have not yet been counted.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the Electoral Authority approved a number of measures that should harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be noted, Michoacán has not officially ratified its political constitution or its State Electoral Code or Electoral Justice Act, as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was due to expire in this election period, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has denied their publication within the deadline set by the Official Gazette Act, saying he had any objections to them.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of the State (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislature and declared the vote of the Head of State on constitutional reforms to be "invalid and illegal" because he had no right "to approve or veto them".
When asked whether the counting could be carried out 'by voice', María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council would allow the local electorate to carry out both the partial and the total counting.
In this way, a partial counting of votes, one or more ballots, will be possible under the following conditions: the results of the election are not agreed; there is no record of the counting and calculation in the relevant box or the President is not available; or if errors and obvious violations of the election results have occurred.
In addition, the total number of votes in all polling stations will be possible if there is evidence that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever an explicit request is made at the beginning of the session by the representative of the party and/or coalition that proposed the candidate in second place.
The total number of votes will also be possible if, after a proper count, the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is found to be equal to or less than one percentage point and also if there is an explicit request from the political party whose candidate finished second.
It should be noted that in this situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between first and second places is less than 0,16%, although 129 of the 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinama Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported to his hometown of Saltillo on Sunday night, with a ceremonial service and a memorial service to be held on Monday.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinama Mountains.
After receiving the highest honors, along with the others who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board a Mexican Air Force aircraft, with family and close friends attending the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived in the chapel in Nazario Ortiz Garza's class, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell party was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school tech classmates and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinama Mountains, as he always told his family and friends", said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
She said the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, was at the top of his life, "was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo at a very young age and entered the Colegio del Aire flying school in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, yet he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even recalls that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan to attend his uncle's graduation, so he is convinced that he died in what he loved most in life: flying.
They gave him one last goodbye.
Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, and I say goodbye to all the honors that have come to him from Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and the state government, the Mexican Army through the Sixth Military District, the Mexican Air Force itself, the executives and students of the Saltillo High School of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled in both study and sports.
Bacio Cortés died in the days following the helicopter he was piloting crashed, with the government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people on board, all state officials.
At 6:05 p.m. the remains of the Saltillean native Bacio Cortés (combined) arrived to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force, under the command of Major Jaime Martinez, through a funeral service, to the square where the family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers were gathered.
Three abandoned bodies were found on the Caderey NL shipment.
Hours before the discovery, military officials introduced the media to 11 people who were detained in the area for organized crime.
The bodies of three men who were shot in the head and body were found on an abandoned property in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery was made on a 1.5 km road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved around in these places noticed that the cabin with a beige-coffee fence had its doors open from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the authorities.
One of the people was wearing a yellow sports shirt and dark cotton pants and not a bonnet, and next to him was a man in a white striped sports shirt.
A few yards away, another body was found wearing a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three of them were lying face down.
According to the information obtained at the scene, all three people were probably murdered elsewhere because no bullets were found.
The cabin fence was found with messages from one organized crime group to another and a series of bullet tracks on both the building and the door.
11 suspects have been arrested in Cadereyt.
The National Defense Secretariat has identified 11 individuals, including juveniles, who were members of a criminal group that operated primarily in the Cadereyta area and is linked to kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burials.
According to the information released, the first attempt on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros resulted in the arrest of eight people and the release of one detainee.
Three properties and a cell phone were seized, and they confirmed they were members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another raid took place at 6 a.m. on November 12th, when a military personnel were walking around the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when they spotted a car without a vehicle and two people in it.
After parking the car, they searched and found one rifle, a machine gun and 18 bullets.
Then, on the basis of these statements, at about 2 p.m. on November 13, one of the accomplices was arrested in the La Frauda area.
They were charged with illegal burial in the communes of General Terán, China and Cadereyt.
On Wednesday, a new Italian government will be appointed.
Prime Minister-elect Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that is keeping this country above the brink of an economic catastrophe.
The Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face a crisis that has kept the country above the brink of an economic catastrophe and has put the entire eurozone at risk.
The Presidential Palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgi Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to introduce a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti has announced that he will present the results of his talks with political parties to form a government to the president.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult stage", the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked", he added.
Monti completed the government formation process in less than three days, much shorter than usual, while Italy struggles to cope with the political and financial crisis that has brought debt levels to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the tough package of austerity measures required by European leaders, only to restore Italy's broken credibility.
Monti is under a lot of pressure to move forward, and because of the volatility of the markets, the interest rates on Italian bonds, BTP, have exceeded the seven percent threshold for a decade, the level that Greece and Ireland had to apply for bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian employers' organization Confindustria, told reporters after meeting with Monte: "We said we would strongly support this government".
We believe this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this crippling situation.
Monti's hopes for success were greatly increased by the support of PDL leader Silvio Berlusconi, who resigned on Saturday after the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to bring good results", Angelina Alfano, the secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because up to this point, many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government of Monti.
Support for Parliament
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to push unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure, warning that Monti's failure could mean disaster.
Monti launched talks with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organisations on Monday.
The round of negotiations ends on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitan, who made it possible to respond to the crisis very quickly.
After a brief decline from late last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond yields have returned to a critical threshold, reflecting uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will be successful.
To save Italy, whose public debt is EUR 1.8 trillion, would be beyond the possibilities of the current financial reserves of the euro area.
Monti stated that his government should remain in power until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that politicians would only give him time to reform and then call early elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this government must be composed of only experts to get Italy out of the trouble the country has been in due to financial pressure.
Political sources said that mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to integrate political figures into the government.
Spaniards participate more often in international matches than Costa Ricans
Ten of the 22 Spanish players will cross the 50-match mark.
For Costa Rica, only one of the 22 players who were called up reached the number 50 ranking.
A huge contrast from Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 players from both countries who met today for a friendly at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the World and European champions, FIFA's monthly number one, have a wide range of Class A inter-county matches on their books, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Umán, who is the only one to have played 50 international matches.
He reached that number last Friday in a match against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the WWE and in the powerful English Premier League clubs, maintain an intense activity in league competitions and domestic cups and high-level matches in European cups such as the Champions League over the course of a year.
To this we must also add the experience of the Spanish national team in the complicated qualifying matches for the European and World Cups.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities to play outside the region, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the highest number of international matches from the Spanish national team is held by goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who last Saturday beat former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches.
Casillas will also make his debut against Costa Rica today, setting a new international record of 127 for Spain.
Xavi Hernández, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 games on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by UEFA along with other Spanish players with 100 matches on their books, including the aforementioned Zubizarret with 126 and Schalke's midfielder Raúl González with 102.
And Carles Puyol came close to the hundred with 97 games.
This is followed by Xabi Alonso with [Fernando Torres, 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both 81; Andrés Iniesta, 62; Cesc Fábregas, 61; and David Silva, 53.
On the Costa Rican side and close to Michael Umán, left-wing Júnior Díaz with 48 matches and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Then only five have crossed the 30-game mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36, and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With fewer than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) are among the favourites.
On the national side with less than 30 games, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25, and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest of them didn't even get past 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included the country on its 20th anniversary tour.
"A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to play one of the best shows at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We've been waiting for over 20 years, but the band itself is making sure that the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true for them.
That's what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, speaking exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is on a 20th anniversary tour of South America and will be at a unique stopover in Central America on Sunday.
He'll be performing at 7:30 p.m. at the National Stadium with the Angel Band The X and the National Musicians of Las Robertas.
This is a sample of an interview, a full transcript of which can be found on La Nación's website.
For your Costa Rican fans, it's a dream come true.
The journey to Costa Rica is also our dream come true.
We've barely been to South and Central America a second time, and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, and it's a beautiful country, and I believe we can spend a few days here.
So we're very excited to bring you our music.
I'm asking, because the band is literally loved here, the fans are having these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your most ardent supporters?
Thank you for staying with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, and we thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry it took us so long.
Some people already call the concert the biggest show of the year.
Does it put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we've done in the last 21 years have been set up in a matter of weeks.
We've done some great shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that's how we get fit for a concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we love surfing, we love the jungle, and for both of these things, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its surf-friendly waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico, and these are the best places to surf, and that's how we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
Looking at your tour, you've put on a huge show with lots of songs.
What are you planning for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no restrictions on what we can't do.
We're going to try to put on the best show with the best variety of songs, play a few songs from each album, and introduce our fans to a good, diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why? Why?
I think part of it's because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs we're going to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised, because we remember why we liked them so much and maybe we've already forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting to us, and that's why I think it's more interesting to people.
This tour is to celebrate 20 years of artistic excellence.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, I'm sure you are.
First of all, I don't think either of us could have imagined that we'd be in a big rock band and stay in it for over 20 years.
We realize how much we've been given and we're thrilled to continue playing together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We're lucky to be able to look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were a significant part of the rise of the grunge genre?
It's always been an honor to be part of this group where the giants themselves are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
Surprisingly, when a movement is born out of a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, a group will be formed in a city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to come from one city at a time.
We're proud of that, and we're honored to be part of the Seattle team.
Sometimes we still play with some of them.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour, and we're lucky to have all of these friends, and we're honored to be part of this movement that started in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stick together and have the same members over the years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is itself a much longer time than the usual group life.
I think, first of all, we're all lucky to still be in this world, and secondly, we're always interested in each other.
We're all close friends, and that's what's allowed us to open up musical paths that give everyone enough freedom to experiment on their own.
We trust each other, we respect each other's music, and I think it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy, but your success has allowed you to do whatever you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew older, it became easier and easier to find balance.
We try not to go on tour too much, because it's very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came here for music, you remember that you have to respect music and what you gave it, and you must not be carried away by being famous rock stars, which none of us have ever really cared about.
How do you remember the next project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first it was something great.
We've been around for three years and we never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long, and most importantly, we still have friends today, Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started out in the band with us. And when I listen to a song or look at the photos, I remember Andy, how incredible he was, how I laughed at him.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to open a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as the forerunners?
Yeah, the production sent us videos with a few suggestions, and we liked this group the most, so we're curious what Las Robertas are going to do live and they have to be really fun.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing he thinks of.
Who influences you as a bass player?
A lot of people.
The first to attack me is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them I could talk about the bassists I like all night long.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge alive when it's not in style anymore?
I think we've all always felt a little bit separated from the word grunge.
When I talk about grunge, I think of the bands I mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came out around the same time, and if that's still the way music is today, that's great, because it's the kind of music that's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are playing better music than ever before.
At first your music was a little cloudy, but now it's more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting because I feel like there are a few songs on the new album that are easier to pick up, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very cloudy, even though they can sound positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and you have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or friend, these things start to affect your art and your music, and these two songs are what they mean to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests.
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss in his lower extremities, his attending physician said.
Fujimori, 72, serving a 25-year sentence for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has undergone four operations and is currently under medical supervision.
His personal physician, Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, told Canal N that Fujimori will be tested at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in three days to determine why he is in pain and why he is losing his lower limb strength.
Aguinaga said he believed Fujimori could get mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself doesn't want mercy because he feels innocent.
He had four operations for tongue cancer, lost 18 pounds, and had other ailments, such as severe erosive gastritis, salivary cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulatory problems in his legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people killed by an illegal army squad in the early years of his rule.
Musician on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to help expand trade between the two nations and address the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday, the most important meeting of the extensive visit, full of political, business and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve as an exchange of information on political matters between the two countries", the Uruguayan presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the dispute with France that came about when French President Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 summit in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to expel countries that would continue to be tax havens from the international community, a statement that prompted a negative opinion from Uruguay and consultation with the European country's ambassador.
Mexico has been the chairman of the G20 since November, a group of the world's most powerful developing and developed countries, and has signed an agreement with the Latin American country since January to exchange information to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to concretise fiscal exchange agreements to get out of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 'blacklist' of countries that have not implemented all the required international standards for tax cooperation.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The bearded installer runs in 3D thanks to Super Mario 3D Land.
For over 25 years, Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly to save Princess Peach from the evil Bowers, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming to stores around the world this month, was designed from the ground up to take advantage of all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play 3D games without having to wear glasses.
"Mario is a character who must tell how to operate a stereoscopic lensless lens", said Omar Álvarez, a press officer specializing in Nintendo in Spain, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier", because until now successful footage like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesperson said that in addition to the 3D image, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", with the task of attracting less skilled users.
Once you've passed this level, you can go into the "second round" of the game at levels that are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real-time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of action, but it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome a variety of challenges and "not rely on optical illusions".
This new entry into the 3D Super Maria also involves the return of the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays a note to the saga's audience and repeats a successful formula from previous installments, which is that the bearded man's installer will have to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in the moves, the surroundings, the costumes and even among the enemies, the "playing" Luigi also appears.
Colom approved the release of Portilla to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had stepped up the extradition of former President Alfonso Portilla, who is to be held accountable in the United States for a conspiracy to launder US$70 million.
This concludes the process of ordering Guatemala to respond to a request by a northern country to extradite Portillo to stand trial.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive and that he recalled that the criminal court had already ordered his extradition.
He assured that during his term he "did not interfere" in court decisions and authorized all issues that came to his table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will be released for murder and serious health injuries and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both of whom will be released for drug trafficking.
Colom's move is a step of execution after all the courts and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to prosecute the former president who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be released after his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling $120 million from the Department of Defense during his presidency, a process that preceded his release, but the DOP appealed and put the case back on the table.
Triniova has helped 6,000 young people in distress
The organization was founded to help uneducated children avoid being on the margins of society.
The balance sheet of Triniov's first 25 years of existence is very important: 6,000 young people who were at risk of social exclusion were helped, and the organization has been helping them overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
This includes the long 100 jobs that have been created for this social group.
The presentation of the balance sheet was also held yesterday as part of a ceremonial event held at the former Fabra i Coats production premises attended by more than 300 people.
Triniov was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district to help low-educated, unemployed, drug-addicted, or socially excluded youths.
The meeting in Sant Andreu yesterday was attended by a large number of representatives of organisations and institutions that have worked with the Association for the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the election, showed the unified nature of Triniov's work.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujole, the former Socialist Adviser on Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former Deputy Mayor and current Environmental Socialist Councilor, Ricard Goma, attended the ceremony.
The current Social Welfare and Family Adviser Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also visited the Fabra i Coats Hall.
Mas said Triniove was born at a very difficult time and that the present day also presents a number of obstacles, but added that the work the association has carried out to this day "is a good foundation".
The President cited Triniov as an example of how to fight against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does", he said.
A house was evacuated, where giant parties were held.
The intruders took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51.
12 occupants left the house yesterday at noon without resisting.
All indications are that the nightmare that the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street were having is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally living in at noon yesterday, where they were hosting a giant party that was being held by neighbors, leaving the building by court order without the need for police intervention.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded", the administrator declared.
The occupants, who seized 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are occupied - took away all electrical and partial water supplies, painted the walls and left behind garbage of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were filled with huge parties that lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that during the time the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the disco emphasizes that the occupants of the building made her unfair competition, selling drinks for 3 euros, whereas the disco costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment business had to respond to neighboring complaints about noise, but the problem was not caused by the visitors to the disco but by the occupants of the house, and especially by those who attended the parties held there, whose frequency and intensity have increased in recent weeks, according to the angry residents of the area.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so serious that they even reached an agreement with the building owner and had been letting her rent for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that they have received multiple complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP's city group in the city hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, demanded last week that "the building be moved immediately and that the problems of civic coexistence suffered by the neighbors and the destruction of the area be ended".
The chairman of the people's committee explained that only one floor was taken last summer, but in recent months, the occupants have been able to enter every floor of the building and almost every apartment, and one of them has even been robbed.
In this regard, he added that "punishment should be ended and consistency should be maintained in the case of acts against civil liability committed in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also cleared a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police arrived at building 35 on Mont-Ral Street after being summoned by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountains?
The architects met to write a lawsuit that brought more than a fee controversy.
The municipal selection process for the 16th Gate opens up the debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the municipality printed several pamphlets in support of Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison to New York's Central Park.
After the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper border of Barcelona, as the Catalan capital is one of the few that does not orientate itself to the north-south axis, but up (up) - down (the sea).
The qualification of Collserol as a nature park goes in that direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wildlife instead of the Yogi Bear.
This was the position until September when the city council announced a mega competition consisting of 16 entries for the same number of entrances to Collserolla.
The gate, of course, is more of a park idea.
Either this or someone's trying to put a gate in the field.
So the only question is, is it Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both purely organisational and reflective of the city, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It's as hot as when two members of this old caste, chosen to meet in an elevator, shake hands.
And it was this act that produced one of the rare coincidences between the ideas of three Barcelona architects and the prominent university professors.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection process is justified.
According to Roldán, after the Gulf side issue was raised, "the mountain side" should also be discussed, so Ildefonse Cerda's speech on green apples was not questioned until the end.
"We must assume that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its wide availability.
Collserola is more complex", said the architect, for whom the name "Gateway to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a demarcation of zones where action is possible".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona, with experience in the world of urban planning, describes the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that conceals "some dangers".
The dangers arising from the "uncertainty that the public space project presents today" following the experience of the 1980s, which had its "swinging swirl" in the Forum area.
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"To define something is to take the next step", that is, to go one step further.
'New urban planning and planning tools must be kept in mind, as the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP)) can cause real disaster.'
If we look more closely at the question, Modol believes that the Collserola valley slope can be "considered a park", but the Barcelona part cannot, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "must not end up in a garbage dump", although he welcomes the fact that the city council offers his grime to intervene in the project "from the first moment".
And he also understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a sort of loophole that allows architects to get involved in the debate, but he "doubts" that it should be this technical profile that will guide multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", he adds) that needs to be created: "Architects should only be tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the game its name is complex because Collserole's global vision is missing from the selection documents: "16 selections have been announced, which deal with all aspects of the mountain-sea axis, but there is no longitudinal study that looks at the area and understands it as a whole".
That makes at least him applying for all 16 bids.
Otherwise, the design of a single gate may affect the concept and definition of the architect of a neighbouring gate.
In his view, the municipality should ensure that the zone immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide throughout the zone with equipment to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino promoted Jonas Larrazaball, who will be released
After 72 days in prison, the law enforcement officer Cadino Red granted a pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in a trial in which he was charged with alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonas Larrazabaal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after being granted a pardon by the legal officer of Casino Red before the Second Criminal Court in the district, which was hearing a blackmail case in which the mayor of Monterrey's brother was charged.
After the Casino Royale assassination, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonas was to ask him to pay an economic quota to allow the Monterrey City Hall to operate an illegal gambling house.
After the public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office began criminal prosecution of the brother of the Panistrian mayor.
After four hours of being held before Public Prosecutor's Agent No. 3 for property crimes, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo, the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days after the second arrest warrant was issued and a Public Prosecutor's Officer denied any involvement or organized crime.
On 19 October, he was taken to the Cadereit Criminal Court on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red for a sum of one and a half million pesos.
The authorities allowed him to remain in the city cells of San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
On October 25, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the Second Criminal Court's secretary, Jorge Yanez, who stated that after nearly two months of investigation, enough evidence had been gathered to prove Jonas' guilt, including a payment of 1.5 million pesos to the casino's agents in return for a promise to allow the operation.
On Monday, Casina Red's legal representative, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecino and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region, so he can soon be released.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez if the damages had been repaired and which of the accomplices had decided to grant the pardon, but the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
According to Official Gazette 197/2011, Jonas Larrazaball is granted legal immunity.
After a briefing with a law enforcement officer at about 3:50 p.m., the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazaball Breton.
The court clerk, Jorge Yanéz, arrived at the prison in the city of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted a formal pardon and his case had been deposited in the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome has provided details of the plane crash that killed the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) has informed that the results of the investigation into the accident in which Cabinet Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died indicate that the helicopter crashed directly into the ground with full force, without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the flight took off, the pilot had stated that climate conditions would allow flights.
"The parts that appear indicate that the unit has come into contact with the ground several times, wings intertwined with tree branches 25 metres from where the unit lost its hull".
It also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons and therefore fulfilled all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, it stated that, based on the investigation carried out in the crash area, no components were found on the ground.
"The search found that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft hit the mainland as if it were intact.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The terrain is sloping from 7 to 30 degrees.
The secretary assured me that at this time, it is most important to get results as quickly as possible, but the investigation may take months or even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the crash, the President's General Staff helicopter was traveling at cruising speed and the accident occurred in soft upland terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a normal over-flight operation", he said.
At a press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome identified six key points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must be able to see the ground during the flight.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports indicate the appropriate conditions of take-off, according to which the aircraft is moving towards the border, between DF and the State of Mexico were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Routes selected:
It's likely that the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility into the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are consistent, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of flight path before the impact.
Dispersing of aircraft remnants in limited territory:
The information we have at this time allows us to assume that the impact occurred in a straight path and from the side.
The scatter pattern of the aircraft's remains suggests that the helicopter was intact at the time of the impact.
There was no fire or explosion.
No evidence was recorded at the scene of the accident indicating an explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the fieldwork, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain is sloping, the slope is between seven and 30 degrees.
The photographs show footage of the likely breakdown along the route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several locations.
After careful searching of the area around the accident, no helicopter remains were found in a territory larger than the designated area, which reinforces the assumption that the crash occurred while the helicopter was still intact.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has started research on the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance is conducting research to identify the gene responsible for childhood and adolescent obesity.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to uncover the genes that cause obesity in children and young people.
In a report, the head of the Biochemistry Medical Research Unit at the National Center for 21st Century Health's Specialized Hospital, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been set up.
This team is supported by postgraduate specialists and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The public, whether or not authorised, can also participate in the research.People can come to the participating IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where tests will be carried out on juveniles every Saturday from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the research had started at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexico State) and that since 8 October this activity has also been carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Centre (East Mexico State).
Once data on 500 to 600 children are collected, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Centre (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to track risk factors in Mexican children and young people and thus prevent the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim was to collect data from 3,000 children and young people aged between six and 14 years, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of inherited diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal failure.
He specified that every Saturday anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference) would be made to all participants, blood pressure measurements, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels, and gene studies (an attempt to identify genes that contribute to childhood obesity) would be made.
Cruz López said the research reflects healthcare professionals' concerns about the alarming increase in child weight.
'Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, only boys experienced a 77% and girls a 47% increase in obesity, and there was a dramatic increase in overweight too,' said an IMSS expert.
He said that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the belief that the country's population differs from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Native American genetic makeup, 30% European and 5% African, and that this is reflected in the genes responsible for diabetes and obesity.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is commonly explained as the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants was that they were given an overall assessment of the children's condition, which would determine whether they were overweight or obese.
He noted that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm suggests the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and precancerous conditions.
The information is confidential, and doctors are writing it to parents explaining all the measures and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent their children from getting sick.
Cruz López explained that there are three main factors that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyle that means a lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the television all day long, and using transportation instead of walking short distances.
Overweight is also caused by high calorie intake, i.e. higher consumption of sweetened beverages, high fat, protein, high carbohydrate (tamask, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) and genetic stress, which is the subject of this research.
There will be no breakdowns in the asphalt from UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, creates modified asphalt with polymers to create a mixture that is more functional, regardless of climate and temperature.
If the pavement were properly maintained, almost 200 000 debris would not need to be repaired after each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who added that if the construction and maintenance of the asphalt pavements were adequate, there would be a significant reduction in debris, or even removal of debris.
In his talk on the Technological Cause of Scaffolding, delivered at the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that under his leadership, the laboratory would develop modified asphalt with polymers to produce a mixture with similar properties as asphalt but greater mechanical resistance at both low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, such as some cities in the north of the country, improving functionality and reducing the production of debris.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a group of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weight molecules called asphaltines, and other low molecular weight molecules called maltes, which together give asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost solid, while at low temperatures it tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but varies during the day depending on weather conditions and temperatures, warns a chemical engineer.
A scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible tile, made up of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the highest layers is the asphalt slab, made of small stones poured into the asphalt and then pressed.
He stressed that every stone that forms the insert is poured with asphalt.
When driving cars or creating pressure, it is possible to distribute the forces well in the carpet.
If it were modified asphalt, it would break down even better, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that the final layer of the asphalt slab is a layer called a mantle, made of fine stone, or sand, also poured into the asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with the vehicle racks, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the road.
Since the coating will be subjected to a high load as part of the bearing, the coating must be of sufficient thickness and care must be taken to the material from which it is made.
Climate, particularly humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factors to keep in mind.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inward and is difficult to get out, it causes all the layers of the tile to soften and thus create wrinkles.
He explained that the film of the coat is first destroyed during the formation of the cracks and then the asphalt inserts are damaged, but the damage is not done at a moment's notice but is a slow process that should be stopped at the first seals by appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of wrinkles, and that the thickness of each individual tile layer must therefore match the load of the vehicle and ensure that this load is not exceeded.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that much work and research is still in the early stages of the asphalt project, including asphalt emulsions, which are already available in other countries and allow for easy repair of the abrasion without the need for high temperatures.
What was missing from a Valle candidate to become the new Miss Columbia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramirez Serna not winning the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle wins the 14th title of the first ever multiple.
Valle del Cauca has again failed to win the Miss Colombia crown.
Melina Ramirez Serna had to settle for being on the podium, winning a silver crown and a sherpa, which made her the new first ever more-miss of Colombia.
Based on the results of the last day's final in Cartagena, where she won and took the crown of Miss Atlántico, the department won the 14th title of first Miss Universe. Melina joined the delegations of women from Valle del Cauca who were crowned winners but were eventually declared first Miss Universe. They include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Leila Blanque (1987), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Isabel Alvarez (2000), Catalina Girdo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
A question many people ask themselves, what was missing?
The result is a defeat of the great favorite who in all previous rounds showed she is good enough to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing she became the Queen's Police and the Most Beautiful Face of Joile de Volgue.
One of the key factors that led the jury to decide that she was only the First Plusemiss was the fact that she was unconvinced by her answer to the question, "What book did you like the most and why?" posed by Martin Murillo Gómez of the literary magazine Leamos.
The candidate replied:
"I read a lot. I believe very much in the role of literature, I think it's a form of culture.
I'm currently reading Crime and Punishment, which is a book that is part of the world literature that we should all know about, and today I have a book with me by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian author.
This response was displeasing, firstly, because of the term "culturation" and secondly because the applicant did not explain how the individual books mentioned her characterized her.
After the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise, what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read if you can.
Another hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the favorites.
A Bogotá journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was the most popular, most celebrated and the one who took all the previous awards (the Oster Gastronomic Challenge, the public title for best artistic dress and the Queen Mother) from the beginning aroused jealousy from other candidates, stressed the queen, who then burned on stage.
It was evident at the first presentation of the swimming pool at Hilton Beach and during the two shows before the final coronation.
Although she shone on both, she was known to lack the strength and enthusiasm that representatives from Magdalena and Atlantico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for Canal RCN's "Like Home", believes that Melinda's first-ever more-miss title confirms the fact that the contestant who wins the most titles does not end up with the queen's crown".
Moreover, Valle has been more unfriendly to the media in recent days, and it hasn't paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Contest.
Just on the margins, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of her country's social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia pageant, beauty is not enough, you have to see more than physical beauty, you have to focus on social feelings, and it's important that candidates get involved in these projects before they enter", she explained.
There is also speculation that Valle's candidate lost points due to her background deficiencies and fibrosis that was evident on her buttocks, but this is in stark contrast to the jury's verdict that she was chosen Miss "Natural Beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queen, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there were better girls, "but problems with the fibrosis of the buttocks, which I don't think were very noticeable, took her points until the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that Valle's cousin made a mistake by undergoing several surgical procedures.
"The surgical procedures are fine, but they didn't work in Valle.
The body was never its strong point, and it took its toll here".
Because of this award, first given by the National Assembly of Beauty, after the swimsuit show, a cruel prediction came true, claiming that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo gave Melina, so that she would not have to be crowned with the highest crown.
Whether that's true or not, it's certain that Melina today began her year of reign, not as queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, to which the National Competition itself will be named.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her crushing success in Cartagena, did not rise to the top of the crown.
That was the job of the Cali resident who identified Alfonso Cana's body.
The Cali fingerprint expert went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cana".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th last year, the CTI fingerprint expert in Cali made history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Farc's supreme leader, "Alfonse Cana", by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint specialists working at CTI, this week's turn was for Eliazar González, a Puerta Tejada man who has been in forensic research for 21 years.
Early in his career, González worked at the city hall in Chocó, where he often had to go through the forest for more than five days to get to the location of the bodies that needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle, the capital, and after completing his studies, he began to specialize in fingerprinting, a science that deals with the study of the friction of the skin, i.e. the hands and feet.
The week that Alfonso Can was undergoing surgery, Eliazar was told to bring at least three days' worth of clothing.
Something big was expected.
He left for Cauca on a helicopter from Palmyra on Friday night.
He knew he would have to identify two bodies and that he suspected one of them to be the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillermo Leon Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived at the body site with the investigation team, he didn't recognize it because of the physical appearance.
He had no beard, dressed like a village boy in the area, no glasses, much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with the galloon shell, ink and the transplant and the light, Eliazar began to compare the dactyl records of the corpse with the notes on the card.
He didn't disappoint his eye: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was assigned to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to confirm whether it was really the Supreme Commander of the FARC.
Searching for a Trace
For the Sijin de Cali dactyloscope, the recognition given to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of the Operational Service against the Canov is very significant.
A lot of people don't know what we do.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, free of the possibility of error, which can play a key role in criminal decision making.
In addition to identifying the bodies, these people help investigate crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of those arrested.
When they get caught, a lot of the offenders present false documents or have no papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and search the database.
The investigator said that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house because the thief was leaning on the spot to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they're not designed to take prints, but in this case we could get a fingerprint of an entire hand and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts", he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove a murder suspect.
A dead man was recently found with bottles of alcohol around him.
The investigation revealed that a family member could be responsible for the murder and the print on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although there's no 100% confirmation that he was the real killer, it's clear he showed up at the scene.
A CTI fingerprint expert explained that the prints were "made using chemical or physical reactive substances".
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used to collect them.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, the criminal database, or the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians who are not getting their data anywhere", said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown on CSI.
Like everything that glitters, there is no gold, and not everything you touch is left with traces.
However, if it can be used, the corresponding comparison must be made.
"Rising" is protesting in New York
Hundreds of protesters have gathered in the Zuccotti Square where they wanted to camp.
Many of them waited for orders to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked a New York City official on Tuesday as they tried to get back to Manhattan Square by court order, from where they were pulled this morning, then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get to, thanks to a court order allowing "angry" to return to the city.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle down in another place and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through rallies and peaceful demonstrations", said one of the speakers of the Occupy Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray said the "angry" response to the camp's evacuation ordered by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg himself reached the courthouse, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning forced evictions and allowing protesters to continue to reside.
In addition, the "outraged" took over another park at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, and the land of the parish at Trinity Church.
They managed to take the seat for at least an hour, but then the police came and stopped some protesters, Bray didn't know the exact number, but he said he saw some journalists being handcuffed.
The organization says that several hundred people have settled in the area, and a delegation of religious leaders has come to express their support and to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed, and a court hearing is expected to take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the early-morning evacuation is to be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters even distributed and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to the officials guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes", Bray said, condemning the fact that some police officers beat protesters.
The court order forbids authorities to evict members of the Occupy Wall Street movement or to use "laws that were published after the spell began, or to deny protesters access to the park with shops or other places they previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that following this court order, the city suspended the reopening of public space and the protesters warned that local laws would not allow them to return to their tents and sleeping quarters.
The city's top official personally defended the early morning evacuation of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and joined because protesters "violate the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the square to be evacuated because it became "a place where people did not go to protest but to break the laws and in some cases hurt others", because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbors were concerned about the quality of their lives".
"The early cleanup was shocking and shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests at the expense of the working American people", added a spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "disrespecting freedom of speech".
Representatives of Occupy Wall Street also said they planned to hold "big events" on Thursday in collaboration with community and trade union organizations to commemorate the two-month protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be playing the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show.
With Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant on Home Improvement, a swimmer on Baywatch, a bunny on Playboy, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now an actress and model, she's going to be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian television Christmas special.
CTV has announced that Anderson, along with sentimental singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, and will portray the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known for her internet-based home pornography footage, appears with her ex-husband, motorcycle "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Leem, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus in a manger.
As Josef, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, recently appeared on stage hosting Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisa Lopilato in late March in Buenos Aires, and is close to controversy.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian a "people" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is coming back to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending the period of declines that began in March
Since March last year, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that escalated into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
Tokyo's government's initial estimates put the material losses at $300,000 million, a wound that is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of declines, between July and September the value of GDP reached a position where it was possible to turn the page with definitive validity: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
The results of the second quarter, in which the Japanese tax year begins in March 2012, also show the greatest growth rate compared to the January-March 2010 period.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery needed to rebuild areas damaged by the earthquake and tsunami.
Enterprises increased their investments by 1.1%, and expenditure will decline by 0.9% from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
But the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impulse to use the crisis to build up or rebuild the infrastructure, to use the lack of it to start from scratch.
Japan has awakened, thanks in particular to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1% due to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Stigma of the Yuna
Flow has been entrusted to the internal market as the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "rescue assets" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the worrying US forecasts.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak results to the yen in July and September.
While markets continue to surround the EU's outlying countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government is cautious.
"We must be aware of the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid rise of the yen", State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And the prospects are not really encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has stated that most Member States showed clear signs of a slowdown in September.
An indicator that predicts volatility in the global economy has shown that the economies of the major powers are slowing down.
It fell four tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average of 100. It reached 99.13 points.
Athens is spreading uncertainty again
Papadimos says the austerity measures will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With rapid and risky margins and uncertainty re-established, Greece is increasingly entangled in the maze leading to a major debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the 'agreement' of the new Greek transitional government is given to the demands of Brussels rather than the genuine conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100 days he was given to be appointed would likely be short for their implementation, the chairman of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, declared that the new austerity measures would not in any way support and repeated his demand for a new election to be held on 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit", Papadimos said yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow in a vote of confidence in the government.
The package of 24 programmes to support employment, a reform of the disciplinary code for officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samarass' message does not clear any doubt about his position: "We pledged to help the transitional government, but we have not pledged to anything else".
The Conservative leader went a little far in his speech to the EU and the IMF, which are to unblock the 8 billion they urgently need, but he also said he would not support or sign any commitment to implementing austerity measures.
The European Commission, already angry at the impact of Papandreou's referendum games, stressed yesterday that its demands are unassailable: it will not block any aid unless the new government and the representatives of the main parties sign a 'written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible'.
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the inspectors from the Troika will return to Athens "very soon" and will negotiate with the new government "what it needs to pay the sixth part" of the $8 billion.
The Greek shell has a little more to do.
Queen Sophia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this type of financing
Spain 'has achieved a significant position at the global level in terms of microfinance'.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor to the planet in the last two decades for this instrument of cooperation, which is essentially "an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity.
The Queen launched the 5th World Micropower Summit in Valladolid yesterday, convinced that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation "is absolutely necessary" for us to achieve the UN Millennium Goals by 2015. "It is in particular about meeting the targets of halving the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, that is, the amount that sets the poverty line".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand its network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, who hopes the Summit's initiatives and contributions, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially women", to whom the loans are primarily intended.
"We've accomplished a lot" and "a lot of challenges are still ahead".
The Micro-Lending Summit is intended to be not only a forum for discussion but also a platform to support the 'basic objectives'.
Her Majesty explained that the goal is to have 175 million poor families access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and to get 100 million families above the poverty line they currently live under.
The concept of micro-loans spread to Spain and other countries around the world "after the pioneer of thought Muhammad Yunus set out on this journey", the queen said, adding that it was "an act of justice and necessary recognition".
She described the instrument's father as "an admirable idealist who set out on a path to fight poverty". She became familiar with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted with its lending policy on the spot.
This experience was followed by others - the first World Summit in Washington, D.C., and others, such as the Ivory Coast Summit in 1999, in Canada in 2006 - "I was able to observe continuous development at all these meetings", explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for the project, earned the title of "Head of the Family" yesterday, given to her by the "Poor People Movement" in Valladolid.
Queen Sofia concluded her speech by inviting the participants to join in the discussion and find solutions to continue the fight against poverty.
"An ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that all democratic states must follow.
In this sense, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only to a period of low-income housing, since this cooperation is a 'permanent obligation'.
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent "a serious and honest policy to eradicate poverty", and that now more than ever, governments in developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criterion and not allow solidarity to become the victim of cuts.
For Spain, micro-loans are one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success of the event, which celebrates the concept of trusting people to whom everyone else is closing their doors.
The CDU proposes to elect a European President on the basis of universal suffrage
Without serious inconvenience for Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel, the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was held in Leipzig on Monday 14 November.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but it was only raised in the autumn, in particular to satisfy party members who regard the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps towards the Italians tomorrow as lax.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission submitted by the leadership was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1,001 delegates voted against and 10 abstained.
A few minutes of applause at the end of Angela Merkel's speech and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, the pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The Chancellor's main idea and proposal can be summarized in the slogan: the response to the crisis is 'not less Europe, but more Europe'.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
The Chancellor of Europe said "it's time for change".
This could be expressed in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty allowing the European Union to strengthen control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage 'with a view to giving Europe a single face'.
This is, in any event, one of the ideas of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all 27 countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: Britain is against it and the CDU leaders think Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same position.
But the direction is clear.
Likewise, the delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to assess the weight of each country on the European Central Bank's board according to the weight of its economy, which would obviously lead to a strengthening of Germany's weight.
The Chancellor, concerned about calming the climate within her party, made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but did not try to get Congress to speak about "small" European states or troubled states willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal for Europe does devote one paragraph to the importance of the 'French-German friendship', Angela Merkel did not quote France.
It's just indirect.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Lipsk.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is incapacity fraud?
After the support, the UMP and the government are launching an offensive against disability.
Nicolas Sarkozy will visit the Office for Social Assistance on Tuesday 15 December in Bordeaux, where he will address a recurring theme since 2007 on combating social fraud and redistribution of solidarity.
As a complement to this offensive, which is based on the desire to save in the context of increased rigour, but no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity for work.
Firstly, because of budgetary savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of incapacity for work on private sector employees before they start receiving sickness benefits.
Clearly, without the consent of the company, an employee who becomes ill would lose four days of wages, or at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring in 280 million euros.
The Commission also considers that the measures would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic importance: to give public servants one day of unpaid incapacity (until now they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the right-wing majority is also raising the issue of fraud, this time around incapacity-related crimes.
"The controls will be much more extensive and, moreover, if you are caught, you will return", Xavier Bertrand warned in an interview with RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about the incapacity for work injustices.
These have in fact been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and political pressure to bear fruit.
The French are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million in daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, daily allowances of EUR 11,3 billion represented 5% of healthcare expenditure in 2008.
Of this amount, 46% were for maternity benefits and work injuries and 54% were for incapacity for work, i.e. EUR 6,2 billion.
That's only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to the Alma Consulting study, the average incapacity for work in France in 2010 was 14,5 days, compared to 17,8 days in 2009.
Average that hides some discrepancies: another survey published in 2007 on the job opportunities site Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not chosen a single day of disability.
Another study, this time by health insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010, 37.8% of disabilities were less than 8 days, 22% were 8 to 14 days, 15% were 15 days to 1 month, 15% were 1 to 3 months and 11% were longer.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are no more prone to incapacity than elsewhere.
A long-term study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS (National Research Centre) researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absences (whether for health reasons or not) ranged between 10% and 11.8% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Incapacity fraud is only a very small part of black work.
As for fraud, these are only small in scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on disabilities longer than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that for 1,5 million checks, 13,8% of the 285,000 were carried out due to short-term incapacity 'unapproved or too long', i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacities longer than 45 days, 11% of cases of 'unadapted or unauthorised' were counted against 1,2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
This represents a total of 169,000 'unlawful' cases per several million workers who were unable to work.
A number that's much less than the number that represents the work in black.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tiana, author of the June report on the subject, this figure would represent between 9 and 15 billion euros missing in the collection of taxes for the year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily payments and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Greece will have to implement a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to restore its economy.
On Monday 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos addressed Parliament and said that the 100 days of unity given to his government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To restore our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new bailout budget", the Prime Minister said on Wednesday, giving his first public speech at the opening of the vote of confidence in Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, he added, as our country's participation in the eurozone is at stake.
As a result, Mr Papademos forecast that the country's public deficit would be 'around 9%' of GDP between now and the end of the year, after being 10,6% in 2010 and 15,7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday expressed support for the already approved measures to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party was not committing to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures", Samaras stressed at a meeting with a member of parliament for his New Democracy party.
We have agreed on targets for deficit reduction and debt reduction and the fight against waste, but we are against any policy that would hinder economic recovery.
To Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan of €8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties supporting the proposed measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says the expert panel
According to the Royal Society of Canada, Canadians are denied death.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including for cancer.
Canadian society lives on the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make decisions about it.
This is one of the conclusions of a comprehensive report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts working in a variety of fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if that choice appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
To begin, experts cite a recent survey by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of deaths in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada was ranked 10th, the study notes that "medicalisation of death in Canada has given rise to a culture where people are afraid to talk about death".
Medication yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with a Royal Canadian Society mandate tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
This is the average for all of Canada, while the province of Quebec has the highest death rate, with 86 percent of those who die in hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report conclude that they are against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to the experts, who have also checked all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered criminal, there is no evidence that this decriminalization causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons who are not competent or who do not consent.
By contrast, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed more than a dozen cases of these outbreaks yesterday in teleconferences in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legal.
"Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is also practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are prone to euthanasia
Recall that a 2010 survey by the Angus Reid Forum found that 85% of Canadians already voted in favor of euthanasia because they believe it will help people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66 percent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean that we're sending a message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for those who assist suicide, 41% of respondents feel that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear when it comes to maintaining or interrupting patient care, the report authors say.
They also propose that the list of recommendations should state in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not a criminal offence.
The Commission of Experts also requires that medical professionals be trained to respect the obligation to refuse treatment at the end of life without fear of prosecution.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including for cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final silencing already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission requests that it be considered euthanasia at the time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Objections of other experts
Some medical legal experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the findings of the Royal Canadian Society's report.
The report's signatory experts were described as 'extreme' by Dr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, among other things because they do not restrict the practice of euthanasia on the sick in the final stages.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 can ask for help committing suicide", says Pierre Deschamps, who reviewed the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that it seems that the authors of the report place personal autonomy above all other values that shape the social wonder of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions".
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she described as a "manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubts the report's data on the absence of error in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, namely the Netherlands and the U.S. state of Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus is talking about a conspiracy.
Syria is increasingly isolated
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated outside the Foreign Ministry yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on President Bashar al-Assad in Syria intensified, who is resisting them with Russian support and speaking of a "conspiracy" against his country.
Two days after Syria's suspension of membership in the Arab League, the European Union has stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, have taken a stand in favour of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was the first Arab ruler to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "transfer power" in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the regime's military have been killed.
"If Bashar was in the best interests of his country, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, a country bordering Syria, told the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts made to mediate with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave", he said, referring to neighboring Syria, which Turkey is increasingly hardening its line against.
The United States welcomed the "enhanced consensus against Assad and the dishonest actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are increasingly using a harsh tone" against the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces were killed in the southern Syrian city of Deraa during this time.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed in "heavy machine gun gun fire and mass shooting in the town of Jobar" in the Homs region.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country had "started a journey out of the crisis".
He also reacted vigorously to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus' membership, which he described as a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not bow down", he added, assuring that "plots against Syria will fail".
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the Arab League is currently developing a "civil protection mechanism" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also welcomes the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repression by a regime he says is "paranoid".
A new special meeting of the League is being convened in Rabat tomorrow to adopt a resolution on the crisis resolution plan adopted on 2 December, which specifically envisaged the withdrawal of troops from the cities affected by the riots and the release of imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday considered the Arab League's decision "wrong" while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while avoiding any support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifice from Italians
Italy's next head of government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and start implementing a program that will include "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's administration.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting with representatives of trade unions and employers today.
He should form a relatively lean cabinet made up of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many victims", said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups taking part in the talks, after meeting with the designated Prime Minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament for a statement of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti presenting a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgio Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented on the nervousness of the financial markets yesterday and asked them for time.
In a "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed, adding that he was "certain that markets will be patient and understanding".
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concerns re-emerged after the unexpected September fall in industrial production in the euro area.
The Prime Minister-designate should form a team comprising mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics" in it.
He expressed his conviction that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next election.
According to Speaker of the House of Representatives Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mario Monti has promised to act with extreme urgency and to make Italy "a strong link" of Europe once again.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesman stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not reach its target of a balanced budget for 2013 and calls for new tough measures.
The head of Confindustria, Emma Marcegagli, who will meet with Monte on Tuesday, spoke of the need to revive the economy 'because a country that is not growing cannot meet deficit parameters'.
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence, a 'professor' who, according to the authors of the introductions, symbolizes 'a call to respect' and 'another Italy', represents for Italy an 'epochal change' after 17 years of 'berlusconism'.
The timing of his team's life will be unknown.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must repay 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator for use in nuclear weapons, a US non-governmental organization specialising in nuclear risks announced Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) shall draw upon a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from that UN agency in identifying the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "grave concern" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, which draws extensively from the documents of the IAEA, V. Danilenko (born 1934) was to work for three decades from the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to be involved in the production of synthetic diamonds by the blasting method.
In 1989 or 1991 he had to leave the centre to set up a 'nano-diamond' production plant in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his companies should have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He was then to work on the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls 'clear evidence that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran' was based on 'the work of a foreign specialist who not only was well versed in this method but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked on this technology for a substantial part of his working career within the country's military nuclear programme.'
Anti-Muslim crimes and offenses have risen by 50%
According to FBI statistics released Monday, crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while other racial and religious violence declined or rose slightly at the same time.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase over the previous year in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which, according to the FBI, were motivated by racial and 20% by religious differences.
"After the 2009 decline, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again", Human Rights First, a human rights organisation, stressed. "The rise in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant", the organisation added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds Paul Legendre, a senior executive at the organization.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these crimes", he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reporting on "hate crime".
"Hateful crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This legal system was enacted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, color, religion, origin, and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more like Facebook
The microblogging service Twitter introduced a design change on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of followers, somewhat resembling its Facebook service.
The new "activity" and "name" offer better and more direct knowledge of the activities of other people who follow you or of people whose replies ("tweets") you follow.
This allows you to know if they allow you to track contributions, if they sign up to new accounts, if they have favourite contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being rolled out to the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with somewhat incomprehensible terms (RT for repeatedly posting someone else's post, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi and un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable and celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users instantly comment on the importance of this innovation in their "tweets".
"It's useless, it takes up a lot of space and it's too much like Facebook", @jemb123 writes.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter", @dannykronstrom posted.
The following is the list of countries:
The entry of the Golden Rule on balanced budgets into the Constitution
The government of the large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write the "golden rule" of fiscal policy into the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid any reduction in the rating of Austria by the rating agencies (AAA).
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the conclusion of the Ministerial meeting, when Austria's public debt was 74.6% above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than that of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year", argued multi-chancellor and foreign minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus follows on from the request of the Eurozone Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where Heads of State or Government strongly requested that the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of a balance of public accounts be incorporated into the Constitution or the Law of the same value by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
The public structural deficit will have to decrease by 0,75% of gross domestic product (GDP) every year by 2017 and, from 2017, the federal government's public structural deficit will not be allowed to exceed 0,35% of GDP every year, while the federal countries and municipalities will have to report balanced budgets.
The objective is to bring the public debt below the 60% criterion set out in the Maastricht Treaty in 2020/21.

Noda is threatening new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to re-invent the foreign exchange markets if it were to continue to strengthen.
"We'll hit like we did last time if we find too much volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Y. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, he only rose to historic heights that forced Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars to lower the value of Japan's currency, which had just recently surpassed the record against the dollar since 1945.
But since then, it has steadily increased in support of investor purchases, who see it as a "safe haven" in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and European debt crisis.
The dollar fell again below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen mark to near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-09, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in Japanese currency is damaging to the island's exports as it raises the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the income obtained by Japanese companies from abroad when converting them into domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the devastation caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast, Y. Noda stressed, fearing that this rise in yen will not kill a fragile recovery in the egg.
The world's third-largest economy restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% over the previous quarter) for the first time in a year, thanks to a survey of the growth of exports and consumption of disaster-hit households.
But the prime minister ruled that the high value of the yen did not reflect "Japan's national economy".
Japan's finance minister, Jun Azumi, called on the Japanese central bank (BoJ), which opened its two-day meeting on Tuesday, to adopt all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures" indicating that no additional currency weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the Securities and Exchange Commission increased its purchases of government bonds by ¥5 billion (€47 billion) and raised the ceiling on purchases of various securities to ¥55,000 billion (€519 billion) to flood liquidity.
The euro area:
Rate is rising, stock markets are failing.
The risk of debt crisis contagion continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in weakened countries continue to grow.
European exchanges still concerned about the stability of the euro area are falling into a negative expectation today, Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC 40 index is down 1.4% to 3,064 points in 10 hours.
The Frankfurt tax rate is down 0.4% and the London rate is down 0.1%.
"With the new tensions surrounding the debt yields of euro area countries in difficulty, stock markets worldwide continue to generate only a fraction of recent gains".
"Investors who are nervous are only too aware of the risk of infection", explains Terry Pratt, an IG Markets broker, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo stock exchange closed with a fall of 0,7%, which was caused by concerns from market participants about Europe's ability to cope with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, is focused on Europe and the exchange will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized", estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resumption of uncertainty about the future of the euro area is hurting the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
In 10 hours, the European currency is worth $1,3570 with a 0.4% retreat.
According to currency brokers, the move came after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday for countries in trouble to leave the eurozone without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain very worrying.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds is 6.85% and the yield of Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
This tension on interest rates in the southern European countries, but also in France, continues to raise concerns among market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, insisted on time in the markets to rectify the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning caused by its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the 'main task' of his government.
Spain is again in a deliberate market position when Sunday's parliamentary elections are held in the country.
The spread between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
In anticipation of euro area growth figures
Statistics indicate that France recorded economic growth of 0,4% in the third quarter, mainly driven by household consumption, i.e. slightly better than the expected growth of 0,3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) revised the figures downward in the second quarter to a decline of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And the truth is, this is the fourth quarter that economists are most concerned about.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0,5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the euro area are expected at 11 a.m. while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over dogma
If there's one topic that can't be grasped by short-term considerations or emotionally, it's energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural that the election meeting should be an opportunity to reflect on such investments and the place where the energy of the core is taken.
The debate will only succeed if all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
There are seven billion human beings on the planet right now, but demographic developments will cause electricity demand to double by 2050 unless we want to cut off a significant portion of the world's population from vital parts of life.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil fuels will have to be addressed to continue generating electricity, while not forgetting the essential need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that is currently missing from ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident has no effect on any of these parameters.
And that's why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear power.
But this is not the case for Belgium, which has submitted its decision to find another source capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which considers it appropriate to build only last generation power plants.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name a few countries, are continuing their efforts.
The United States, following Fukuyama, decided to expand its park by one unit by rebuilding one power plant that was shut down after the Three Mile Island disaster.
If the German renewable energy model is ever presented as an example, reality is the opposite.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in the price of electricity, the increased energy dependence on gas imported mainly from Russia, the sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
We'll be experiencing all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The Danish case deserves our consideration.
The European champion in wind power, which generates 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which lead to CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices being 65% and 50% higher respectively than the European average.
On the contrary, because of the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay 40% more for electricity than the French households pay.
While in a globalised economy energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing the maintenance of industry on national territory, French businesses enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Therefore, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would lead to a sharp rise in electricity prices that would make illusory beautiful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, and they are not fundamentally opposed to this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Recall that our country's energy policy has allowed us to create a sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 follow-up jobs.
The strong exporting sector is attracting to international markets a large number of small and medium-sized specialized enterprises creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France were to leave the core, it would sacrifice a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose €6 billion a year of its export of nuclear equipment and services.
What power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to run for 60 years while its manufacturer was scheduled to fail?
When solving the energy equation, we have to admit that there is no magic source for energy production, and there is no evil one.
The development of low-carbon CO2 plants, nuclear plants and renewable energy plants by the French industrial group AREVA is evidence of complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Department of Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have a sense of safety in their blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has seen three major accidents.
The only one on Three Mile Island that happened under normal operating conditions and left no human casualties or environmental consequences.
The Chernobyl tragedy was caused by the reactor concepts and the unforgivable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale that killed tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident just as it did the two previous ones.
The result of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor is a concept capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While all interested parties consider that the construction of a nuclear power plant in Flamanville would be a great gift to the competitors of the AREVA Group and EDF and would open the way for them to take a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate a debate so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from a variety of angles - the overcrowding of police, courts and administrations subject to census policies, the compatibility of this policy with the "land of human rights" status that France boasts.
Recently, this was an administrative harassment targeted at foreign students, which became a topical issue when the Minister of the Interior (see the letter Liberation of 23 May) declared that France "needs no foreign talent, butchers and waitresses".
But so far, it has rarely been discussed from the perspective of economics.
I must say that there is a fairly broad agreement between the left and the right in this area.
On the right, Jacques Chirac declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with 2 million migrant workers" and on the left, Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the poverty in the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, fears of an invasion of Polish plumbers into French territory were shared by right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity we strive to provide to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to the banality of saying that joint development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may be true in elections, but it's very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in their recently published work, Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, p. 352: There is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration on economic growth, wages, and employment in countries that host immigrants.
Restricting immigration is crippling growth and hurting jobs.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less skilled, and they are putting pressure on them to cut their wages.
But experience shows that immigrants are actually much more of a complement than substitutes for French workers by doing work in sectors with shortages of workers.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers and those most skilled in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Just as the surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementary relationship between French and immigrants causes the arrival of immigrants to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements would lead to a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And it doesn't take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the Nobel laureates in the US; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries, on average, at 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, one immigrant over the age of 30 will contribute a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 to the public budget for the rest of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his term, expressed his desire to "get the missing growth percentage with the valued teeth".
The teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, we have to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, for although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece during the 20th century.
Some people might believe that for democracy to triumph over its enemies definitively, it would be enough to make a choice and make it the most direct way possible.
But it has been known since Napoleon that it was easy to think.
The universal suffrage, although a necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become, as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said, a "pressure tool".
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of the department and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been since the beginning of the crisis in politics and democracy.
The confession of the mistake of the Greek yes-no referendum will have the value of a double revelation in this respect: the need for a major return to political power, but also the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be reflected in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the Democratic struggle have shifted today and many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We can't get anything if we demand a series of national referendums organized as necessary and disorganized.
A white man exposed to a European absolutist monarch or a knotted-leg jump into the void of nationalist depths: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full, peaceful and uninterrupted exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - and we wouldn't know where to stop the count, anyway - because there is a crisis in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, which is subject to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, that suffers from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
The European project on democratic sovereignty must be re-run as a matter of urgency.
For only together can Europeans reduce their debt burden, get rid of market governance and prepare the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will be that decisions at European level cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise they would lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now demanding a European economic government.
- You should be.
But to think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such citizens, would be a new madness and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European building.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" republicans.
The revolution in interests could not have been enough.
This lesson is still valid.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This can only be achieved by building a more politically democratic Europe and a true European democratic sovereignty.
Let's become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the World Chip Card Fair opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart Cabinet, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of microchip cards (banking cards, SIM-card phones) to more than 6 billion units.
The most portable is the segment of contactless technology that allows paying in public transport or making purchases by simply bringing the card closer to the reader.
This year, 460 million chips should be sold worldwide, compared with 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to rise further in 2012 (an expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6,925 million cards).
After a long withdrawal from the APEC countries, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the start is more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But the big business chains work for two.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
To set a higher speed limit, banks will need to supply their clients with them from now on.
"Two major French companies have committed to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their customers in the future", states Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is just the first step towards the payment method of the future: mobile phones.
Today, only a small number of devices are equipped with the near field communication (NFC) technology needed to conduct transactions.
"They're late".
"But their true heyday should come next year".
"We estimate that for 2012 they will sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide", explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing for the future.
The Crédit agricole Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test in Caen, which will run from December to June next year.
Approximately 200 clients and associates' iPhones will be equipped with a contactless payment enabling case.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale announced yesterday that it was preparing to launch an offer to allow its clients to pay by mobile phone without touch.
The terrorist front stretches from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram.
Longstanding suspicions of links to the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's deputy foreign minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had "become certain" about this from now on.
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them", he explained without further clarification.
It seems Paris has similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help to illuminate the bridges.
After AQMI members were abducted from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers in an operation carried out by French special forces.
In the aftermath of the raid, French and Nigerian investigators were supposed to find several cell phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
The axis of terrorism
Analysis of the calls conducted leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one that leads to a Nigerian longtime resident of Maiduguri, the northern Nigerian town that is the headquarters of Boko Haram, and the other to a man said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
"It's progress, but we need to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is becoming increasingly active", said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator.
In recent months, this 'support' has become increasingly apparent in the development and demonstrations of Boko Haram or its operational procedures, which now involve human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type as those used by AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems that Boko Haram has created.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Quickly Successful
Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammad Yusuf. Boko Haram, which means "Western education is sin" in Hausa, approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection is rapidly gaining ground.
The sect is politicized and demands strict adherence to Islamic Sharia law while its followers wage a war against the central government.
These people are focusing on churches, bars and offices first.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters became extremely active and multiplied their attacks on police stations.
The government's reaction is always the same.
The army is surrounding the city, resulting in 800 dead.
The sect's founder, Mohammed Yusuf, is captured and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its northern base.
He will carry out an assassination in Jos on Christmas Eve 2010, killing 80 people, followed by another in the capital Abuja.
In June, it's again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack police headquarters in its first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa to lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia is a concern for all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and the Iger and the Somali al-Shabab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat to the continent.
In an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan last week in Nigeria, Alain Juppé said France was in a state of emergency and was ready to "give all information".
The world according to presidential candidates
On issues involving China, Iran or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are leading the way in simplification and ignorance.
Can America, undermined by the crisis, manage the world with simple or even simplifying ideas?
That's what voters might think when they hear presidential candidates.
For days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating the grim statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
Often unfounded slogans about China, Iran or aiding Israel merge.
Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for the Grand Old Party, has threatened to call the Chinese to the World Trade Organization and accuse them of "manipulation of their currency", a hot topic in America for the widespread migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
Worse, if this must involve starting a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost stuck to an attitude that "depresses" emotions.
He demanded a hard but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman, who is in the bottom spot in the polling, remains unheeded.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will imprison Iran", he declared boastfully.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-placed candidate, is proving an embarrassing ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a strong stance against the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - an obviously unknown fact that China has had nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michelle Bachmann.
Everyone is far from John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say Reagan had simple ideas too and yet won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses about Libya, and thus attribute him to a label of weakness.
But the attack is not easy.
The public is more positive about President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden.
Iraq has no confidence in military intervention that leads to a decline.
And with the argument that America needs to be rebuilt economically to be able to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is in a better position.
Nord Stream, the new port of entry for Russian gas into Europe
The Nord Stream long-distance gas pipeline connecting Eastern Europe directly to Russia and running along the bottom of the Baltic Sea has started to operate.
It must supply the equivalent of 30 million households with gas.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that will connect Russia and Germany directly under the sea, last Tuesday.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte together turned the controls around the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
The new pipeline will provide an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas annually to Western Europe through the first pipeline of 1 224 km connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Mecklenburg-Maritime Union.
The second pipeline, to be completed by the end of 2012, will supply a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to the total French consumption.
And it's already being mentioned that a third pipeline could be built on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge building is a victory.
Poland and the Baltic States strongly protested against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being carried over to the country by any third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries are losing some power: the ability to pressure Russia with threats to shut it off from Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed it most forcefully when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact", with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the 1939 occupation of Poland.
It means saying that this is a politically sensitive issue.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater confidence in its purchases.
But it's at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project created a rift between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia barely succeeded five years ago in implying its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy, high-gas-consuming Western states whose deposits are nearing their end.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically", François Fillon confirmed at the opening ceremony of this pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom's top officials, who are in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply hub.
The construction of this pipeline is also a significant technical factor.
Underwater pipelines shall be made of steel with a concrete layer to protect against anchorages of seagoing vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
It was built to avoid mines dating back to World War II.
"Nearly 100 of them had to be removed or destroyed for safety reasons", says Jens Müller, a Nord Stream spokesman.
Measures to protect fauna and flora also needed to be increased.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing 242 Eiffel towers, which is not interrupted anywhere by valves or maintenance stations throughout its length.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project manager rejected it when the Swedes were very unwilling to see the Russian state-owned company permanently settling on their shores.
"In case of failure, we will stop the gas flow in less than a minute", says Jens Müller.
In the event of a failure, the gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air.
But the builder's view of this case is unlikely, as the welds were designed to create a roughness once every 100,000 years.
The control of the outdoor gas pipeline is carried out by a submarine robot towed by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device circulating inside.
This 1 metre diameter cigar-shaped device is inserted into the interior of the pipes and pressed by gas.
For the purpose of the three-day journey at a speed of 3 m/s, it shall provide accurate information on possible deformities of metal parts.
The long-distance pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is simply provided by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at launch and 100 bar at target.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
The lead position remains with Gazprom, which holds a 51% stake.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15,5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies have set up a joint venture called Nord Stream to build and operate the pipeline.
The company is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased all its gas transport capacity to this company for five years under a renewable contract.
'Gazprom will benefit from the total capacity, whatever the actual volume of gas transported,' explains Jens Müller.
The construction of the pipeline was financed by 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
The total labour costs for the two pipelines are expected to reach EUR 7,4 billion.
The investment costs for GDF Suez thus amounted to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be repaid, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline is coming out of the Baltic Sea at Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
The valves, which are 4.5 metres high, form the gas gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of incoming gas before it is transported to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, this will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - trade mark notary
Moleskine, an Italian company founded 50 years ago, wants to restore the joy of writing.
It smells of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular plates and its leaves, which are white in color as if they were aging over time.
After all, the Moleskine logger, as we know it today, was born back in 1997.
At that time, Milan-based Italian company Modo Modo decided to launch a new, designated but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is interested in introducing a new product.
The recorder is inspired by the old production technique 'moleskin' (skin imitation), which is used for example to modify the surface of the benches.
This type of notebook was highly prized by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has restored an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12,7 million units last year.
The situation is a distant secret production from the early years, when only 3,000 subscriptions were made.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It's hard to put together a fake portrait of a buyer because the bookie is as much interested in business as a student or a professional.
Moleskin's image of the notebook includes the fact that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-mindedness.
The small Italian company, which started with 12 employees, now has nearly 100 employees and, since 2008, has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookstores and through the FNAC chain to small boutiques in the city center where he can assert his identity.
"We followed the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the tumultuous development of emails", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskin notebook: the brand recently opened the exhibition "Zazachka", where architects or artists display their notebook.
In August, at the Locarno Film Festival, she also unveiled new billboards reminiscent of leopards.
Moleskine profits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pens, notebook cases... The brand is expanding to a wide range of carriers.
A success that sparked jealousy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment funds SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskin's history.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed handicapped workers?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
Today is the 15th week of disability employment.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the proportion of unemployed persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the whole population.
Is that depressing?
"No", emphasizes Eric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes Employment Week for the Disabled.
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable".
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher".
"However, much remains to be done".
It should be noted that many obstacles remain for unemployed persons with disabilities before they enter the workforce.
This is the case for older people: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a degree and only 10,000 of the 2.3 million university students are handicapped.
And finally, long-term unemployment is very common: 53% for the disabled versus 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make returning to work particularly difficult and which are at the heart of the problem, according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, which was set up in 1992 to help enterprises recruit handicapped workers.
So much for the objective brakes.
There are still unspeakable ways of thinking that are certainly developing, but too slowly.
A study by IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité in April found that managers surveyed had "a poor level of knowledge about disabled people" with "an overestimation of people in wheelchairs and mental or mental disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the target of employing 6% of handicapped workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The latest figures, which date back to 2008, show a level of 2,6%.
"We are now moving around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, which collects fees from companies that do not comply with the law.
The evidence is the number of 'fined' enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which decreased between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law which increased contributions put a lot of pressure on businesses", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large businesses".
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
"What a lucky day"
Before the French team called on the Blues on Tuesday night, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens were not hiding the pleasure of this friendly match.
We won't go so far as to write that there was a union between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the stadium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made a brief and good peace.
Five months after his attacker's angry gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach only praised his player.
"I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, and the fact that he loves his country".
"I want to move forward", assures the Frenchman Lille.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches, "it's the same thing, excuse yourself".
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium".
"I need to clear my badge".
Hazard, who was saved against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "light up".
The concept of "joy" cannot be ignored.
Play against the Bleus, who he's been encouraging since he was seven years old and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan", he says.
This certainly adds to the "special" nature of this meeting.
More so because opposite "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We crossed the line right away".
"To play against them is only a pleasure!"
Leekens kindly mentioned "pride".
Pride to fight the feast.
'Proud' to say, in the quality of 'neighbors', that France has once again become a very high-level team, a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African town of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous amount of work", he sighed.
Although Belgium will be missing the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with France heading... to Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great", he stressed.
"We're just building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll know it for the next game, including against France".
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento starts his fight against Bosnia at 22h00 on Wednesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Both teams were lacking in realism on the way there.
"At the end of 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and, above all, a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
The Portuguese national football team, which he has been at the helm since 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
We have one match left to play and one opponent, Bosnia.
With Friday's score 0-0 in hell, Bosnian Zenica, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour's lead, but they couldn't score a rare goal that would have relieved him.
"It's a good result, but it does involve risk, because we didn't score a goal out there".
But at their stunning Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will step up to the audience, who should create a boiling pot, even though the match certainly seems "very balanced", says the optimistic but cleverly thinking Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are quite confident that we can have the upper hand", said the 44-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012", said Carlos Queiroz' successor.
The undecided game on Friday in Bosnia is forcing the Portuguese to score and win.
An undecided game may be enough for the Bosnians, who need to score a goal as well.
"It's a good result, but it does involve risk because we didn't score a goal out there", Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and has players with great individual qualities", he added.
Like Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team from the outset so as to "give them no time to think".
Good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
