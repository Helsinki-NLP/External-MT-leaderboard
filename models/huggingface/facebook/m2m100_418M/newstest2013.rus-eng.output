Republican strategy of opposition to Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight counterfeiting in elections.
However, in the Brennan Center, the latter is considered a myth, claiming that cases of falsification in the U.S. elections are more rare than cases of deaths from a blast strike.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral falsification in the United States in ten years.
One thing can be said with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the US.
This is why most state governments have adopted laws since 2009 that complicate the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon got a new scale after the November 2010 elections that brought the Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, in only one year 2011, 180 bills were adopted restricting voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral law requires the voter to present a identity card with a photo and proof of the presence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, cancell the right to register the voter on the day of declaration of will, and take away the right of vote from the citizens with judgment.
Before the 2006 election, none of the U.S. states required voters to submit a identity card with a photo.
Indiana became the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the law adopted in Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities have rushed to spread this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they initiated a bill obliging voters to submit identity certificates with photographs in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity certificate as a medical insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people who have reached the required age to vote, don’t have a identity card with a photo issued by the government body of their state.
Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 don’t have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds $100.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect youth, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 percent of African Americans, 15 percent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 percent of citizens aged 65 years and 20 percent of voters aged 18 to 29 years don’t have the required identity card with a photo.
But that’s not all yet.
Students - voters who are believed to vote for candidates from Democrats, in several states are not allowed to use a identity card with a photo issued by their school.
However, the same states allow the members of fishing and hunting clubs, who mostly vote for the Republicans, to use the certificates issued by these clubs for voting.
Until 2004, none of the states required evidence of the presence of American citizenship for voting.
This is the first time that such a requirement has been introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of outgoers from Latin America.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote for the Democratic Party.
In 2011, the Republican lawmakers also initiated laws abolishing the registration of voters on the day of the vote in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This limitation did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 election, the voter registration campaign helped put about 10 million citizens into the lists.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17% decline in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period of premature voting.
Thus, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters voting early were African-Americans, although the latter were only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.
The same happened with those from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of the voters, they accounted for 24% of the citizens who voted early.
Unlike the white, which, forming 76% of the voters, among the voters early voted was only 46%.
Of course, Democrats and their supporters are actively opposing the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were promised by governors-democrats.
The action of the most unambiguous laws was suspended by the intervention of the United States Prosecutor General.
This allowed to partially limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring the presentation of identity certificates with a photo.
However, the new rules that came into force will make it difficult to exercise the voting right in the 2012 elections.
Critics from Democrats condemn the prejudice of the laws that have been adopted, seeing in them an obvious focus on influencing the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that adopted these laws represent 171 out of the 270 votes required in the electoral council to win the presidential election.
It is too early to assert with confidence that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is undoubted: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Screening of prostate cancer: to pass a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives erroneous results, false-negative, and sometimes false-positive, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so unwanted passing through dispersion, have something to doubt even more.
Going through the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, numerous cases of infection were observed among the group of researchers, so the data obtained is difficult to interpret and it is difficult to elaborate any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different levels of mortality in those patients who were scaned and those who did not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of metastases was 30-40% higher in those who did not pass the screening.
Therefore, I would recommend taking the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin are also at increased risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and slowly flowing.
The patient should explain the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without compulsory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a danger to life in the long run, and making a choice, in these cases, in favour of active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not go through the course of treatment, as their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a life threat.
We will offer them active monitoring, and if the disease begins to progress, we will start treatment.
More and more times we accurately determine the criteria for deciding who should or should not go through the course of treatment.
So I would recommend going through the test.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether you need to pass this test or not.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Mobemberg has created a tool that allows you to evaluate everything for and against passing the PSA test.

Prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, keeping a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
It is believed that if all people were healthy and moving enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If no one smoked anymore, this figure would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Bole, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain unexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, fighting smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is a risk factor for many others.
It causes huge harm to people’s health.
"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Bolier.
A promising fact: 10 years after cessing smoking, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
Weight
According to the CAR data, excess weight and obesity also contribute to the appearance of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, thick and rectal, digestive, pancreas and uterus.
“Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” the association added.
The food
The association also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.
In too large amounts, it increases the risk of developing colon cancer.
Coal products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by boiling, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,” the Association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin additives on the development of cancer.
But at the moment, the results of these studies cannot be called unambiguous.
According to SCC, vitamin E studies give controversial results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of developing prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
There is also no complete clarity in the assessment of the effect on cancer development of vitamin D.
However, Mr. Bolo emphasizes that your concerns and family history is important to discuss with your doctor.
“The test does not lead to cancer.”
Higgs Boson in Details
Last summer, the message that scientists may have managed to discover the Higgs boson caused a real agitation – and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all the particles in the universe, neither much nor little.
Furthermore, it is the last particle whose existence was predicted within the Standard Model — our best, or, in any case, the "most imperfect" description of nature and behavior of matter — but which was not previously discovered by experience.
But physicists are not yet completely sure that it is the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we are dealing with a truly new particle and that it resembles Higgs' boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Additionally, the new data presented this week at a large physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although for full confidence some data is not yet available.
Let’s still imagine that it’s about the Higgs boson, as the chances of mistake seem minimal, and let’s see what it means.
There is, in this world, one law completely inevitable, which states that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no possibility to overcome this rule, don’t even try too hard, otherwise hurt yourself.
But although the physics of elementary particles is a rather strange world, it turns out that there is also one law of similar nature: the principle of Paul's exclusion, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consists, in common features, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good-order citizens, called fermions, who reasonably obey the principle of Paul.
In the other, the bosons, an angry gang of anarchists, who have no respect for anything, at least for that principle, which means that they can calmly be in the same place at the same time.
The Particle Adventure Laboratory of Berkeley reports that these bosons are, in turn, divided into two groups: the mesons that we will not talk about here, and the “particles of force” through which the main forces of nature are spread and to which in some way the Higgs boson applies.
These most bosons should be emphasized, not all such exotic beings as you could think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, then it is due to one incredibly banal boson: the photon, or the “particle of light,” which is the “curator” of the electromagnetic power.
In fact, when one particle with electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “breaks” the electromagnetic field in that particular place, like a stone thrown into a pipe.
From this “infraction” a electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon – and therefore one of the bosons of “power carriers.”
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, Higgs field, must be "broken".
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very and very high energies, as if it was a frozen grid, the surface of which could be overwhelmed by only a very large stone.
That’s why we need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that is operated in the CERN – the Great Adron Collar, a ring with a diameter of 27 km! – to reach such enormous energies.
Analogue with the electromagnetic field is also useful to explain the ratio between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a paper sheet, for example, will never hold itself on the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like photon, by the way) do not have it.
So what can all these studies bring, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to perceive the difference between the results of observations and the forecasts of the SM.
Additionally, some of them are passionate that such a difference may be discovered, since the smallest disagreement can open the door to "new physics" and shut down some hole of the Model.
The latter, to say, still has substantial shortcomings, without offering any explanation for gravity (the!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (the!).
But so far such differences have not been found.
Consequences
The benefit of these studies for the daily life of an average person is harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the Bell laboratory laser research could not even guess what revolution their work would trigger.
They predicted their applications in science, but not more.
In fact, the already dead physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the previous was impulsive) in 1962, said that the laser was initially considered rather as a "laboratory gadget."
Imagine...
In addition, the application can be found for the tools that accompany the research.
For example, the same William Boyle developed a small light sensor during his optical research in 1969.
This sensor, although it was not its original purpose at all, now serves as a "eye" for all digital cameras in the world and has earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative aid is the best way to die.
The Decent Death Commission in Quebec recently discussed a delicate question of the end of life.
Debates should be renewed soon, and a bill is being prepared at this time.
However, there is still a lot to be done in this important area.
“Dolg” tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Monterrey.
Prostate cancer, which destroyed him from inside, gave him a two-year delay.
“I’ve been given five years, I’ve lived seven,” he says, between life and death, lying in the bed in the shelter of the palliative guardianship of Victor-Gadbue in Belay, where he arrived the eve.
“But it’s always a shock, it’s impossible to prepare for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that does not allow you to go to the toilet and even eat yourself.
Sitting behind the table on which the appetite meal stands, he surrenders and agrees to help him eat.
He wakes up, even becomes able to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medications, take him to the bath.
Courage before ordinary death.
“My greatest desire to be healed from diarrhea is humiliating,” he acknowledges.
A few hours later, the staff found a remedy for this disease.
“Thro life, we are taught that a man must urinate standing,” says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadboa shelter.
Regressing to the child’s condition is unbearable for some.
“Everything depends on the man’s ability to humiliate the decline,” he says.
Since, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliative care, important events occur at the very edge of this decline.
Patients who enter the palliative residence of Victor-Gadbua are all sick of cancer.
The forecast takes them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses is no longer providing the help called "healing".
Mrs. A., 89 years old, is most afraid to die “in the consciousness of suffering.”
But the illness allowed me to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she added.
“I don’t want anything in life anymore,” she says before allowing her to wear a breathing mask.
She is still waiting in the coming days for her son’s last visit from Italy.
In the Victor-Gadbua shelter, with the help of a group of volunteers, they provide body care and nutrition assistance.
This is a palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
Quebec has one place for every 11,700 inhabitants in the palliative aid facilities.
This is very little, given that sooner or later we will all die.
Here life continues in the best conditions as possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it is physical, emotional or mental comfort.
The deceased we will agree to provide mouth wipes from a brandy or pepsi, regardless of what he will ask.
Diabetics are no longer compelled to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
We brought the beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
In the morning his son touched the beer in the feet of the deceased.
“We’re helping the loved ones as well as the patients,” says Natalie Savar, Director of Patient Care.
There is no day in Victor-Gadboa shelter like the previous day.
Along with a 93-year-old old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the courtyard, placing on his pockets during a toast in his honor, tragically dies a 36-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two little children and trying everything to survive.
“In the last six months from three to five cakes, cancer patients under the age of 45 have always been busy,” says Dr. Christian Martel concerned.
53% of the patients taken to Victor-Gadbu's shelter come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that is provided to relieve the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether it is at home, in the hospital or in the refuge.
And some institutions, such as the Victor-Gadbua Pride and the Society of Palliative Care at the House of the Great Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this big gap in Quebec’s healthcare system that causes many doctors – palliative care specialists – to be afraid of a law that legalizes euthanasia and suicide assistance.
Starting from October, a manifesto signed by lights in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfur Mount and Dr. Bernard Liapuant, is circulating and testifies that they disagree with such initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec’s healthcare system is not efficient enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is permitted.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency department, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to relieve them.
I'm afraid that patients want to die only because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day are trying to save patients despite pessimistic forecasts.
Ellen Richard's hopes of survival were already minimal when she stopped chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I’m ceasing treatment, she replied that she’s sorry that I’m ceasing the fight.
She told me that my days were counted.
There is no full care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask for death thank the medical staff for their failure to fulfill their request after the palliative care team relieves their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely comprehensive in the fight against pain.
According to Elsey Monroe, director of palliative care at the Society of Palliative Care at the House of Great Montreal, patients are not susceptible to anesthesia in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until the moment of his death, either from time to time, or constantly.
We can’t pretend that we don’t know about these suffering.
More and more patients who are unable to relieve the pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain always say the same phrase: “I want to die.”
But it doesn’t necessarily mean “I want me to be euthanasia,” it means “I want me to be easier.”
The creation of this report became possible thanks to a journalist grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
Massive Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for road construction, construction contractors, political parties funding collectors and Italian mafia experts day after day tell what they know about the enormous “system” that revolves the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unions and mafia.
“Industry” which was very expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how this system disappears after all the funds have been put into practice, Jack Dušen, a deputy and former police chief in Montreal, laughs.”
It is because of him that in 2011 the scandal broke out as a side result of the investigation of official crimes related to road-building contracts in Quebec, which the Prime Minister of that time from the liberals, Jean Share, agreed very unwantedly.
The "Dushen Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, he emphasizes, only the Ministry of Transport would retain a billion dollars on contracts," if some would restrain their instincts to take part.
The Sharbonno Commission “has already removed two mayor,” he adds, hoping that it will be able to “open the schemes behind individual personalities.”
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was joined by the 2011 Permanent Anti-Corruption Division, which included a large state of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the staff of the special unit "Molot", who after 2009 forced the "Eastern Cartel" of Montreal, to stop exaggerating the cost of the contracts.
A series of surveys have been carried out over the past few weeks, and some municipal officials, in particular Franco Zampino and Rishar Marcot, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
On the row - Gill Wajankur, who recently resigned from the post of mayor Laval, the third largest city in Quebec province.
He is suspected of repeated receipt of charges when placing government orders.
Furthermore, the official accusation has been filed to several engineers of the Montreal Road Service and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akkurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter exploded a real bomb, telling the investigation of the "system" of receipt of state contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who, in turn, transferred the money to the party of Mayor Gerald Trump "United Montreal".
In the 2000s, Zambito broke money to the right and to the left. He listed more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to the various province parties, mostly to the liberals who were then in power.
He also admitted that he illegally collected funds for former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party, Natalie Normandy.
Canneling contracts in which the cost exceeds
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked hard.
Gill Surprenan, a former civil construction engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years he received from construction firms gifts, invitations to trips, to golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey matches and a total of $736,000 in exchange for sanitation contracts, the cost of which he exceeded.
Other officials responsible for the construction of the roads admitted that they were getting on the foot, exceeding the account by 30-40% with the help of false supplements.
Then a party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Trump of deliberately closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party’s cash with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Trump resigned in early November, immersing Montreal in a deep crisis.
Shantal Rulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal to raise the alarm.
The mayor of the Riviera de Perry county in the east of the island, it has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of the municipal area, purchased for $5 million and re-selled for $1.6 million to builders in the middle of the construction boom.
70% dirty money in electoral campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which will eventually be started, she will “take for a niche that allows you to understand the functioning of the system that smells to stop the gangrene and identify the guilty.”
This process it characterizes as “smallful but positive.”
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and an observer to avoid the return of doubtful practices.
How we clean up at home.
Regularly .
Jack Dušenon notes, on his side, that “the criminals stole hundreds of millions of dollars,” but he is concerned about the role of “electoral officials who knew about this scheme” but who did not participate in the machinery.
Given that the portion of dirty money in the financing of the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he laughs: "I was told that it was just a blurry reflection of reality."
Quebec’s government proposes to limit to $100 donations to the parties, but, according to him, this will not change the situation: “Until we strictly limit election expenditure, there will be dirty money in politics.”
He requires a complete restructuring of the system of provision of state contracts and party financing: "We cannot go down; by courageously insighting into the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legality."
If this story throws shadows on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dušen calls on those who laugh to look at their own garden.
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
This season you have achieved an unusual scale in the PSG.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be a new measurement of PSG.
Great players arrived.
I grow with them every day.
Technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors cause me to raise the level of my game every day.
During the match, it is easier.
Everything happens very quickly in football.
I am not burning.
From the very beginning at the pre-training center at the NIF in Clerfontein and before my arrival in Saint-Etienne, I’ve always been moving forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti.
Complete this summer is not new to play matches of very high level.
They also know that every workout is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me, desires to be on the level and put up to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti supports my positioning.
He is assisted by such supporters as Claude McKellé, who played in the same position as me.
Anchelotti is the master of the position?
of course.
Anchelotti has respect for all the technical staff.
Today in the First League he has no equals and he is among the best coaches of Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he has won a lot of titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
In January I had a pleasant conversation with him.
Then I left a whole series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In the First League, Lyon took the leader’s place.
But we are still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified effectively in one eighth final.
What is the goal of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on everything can be.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish the first in our group, before Porto, to have the opportunity to take a reverse match in one eighth final.
Will PSG become the top European club in the short term?
He has a budget for that.
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate its long-term positions.
Today it is not so.
The PSG has financial resources to make this project real.
Not taking the title in the First League, as last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
We really want to win this championship this year.
We were close to this last season.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to get to the final first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points implies the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played even more fantastic season.
This year I think everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have joined the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Do you not think that the media is expecting too much from PSG?
It’s normal that we’re expecting a lot from us, taking into account how much we’ve been invested and what players we have.
We are fully prepared for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Troy at home and we still find something to criticize, of course, it’s a bit scary.
We wonder what people expect from us first.
We will never win every weekend with a score of 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to implement the game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have shown in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who has not been able to pass in one eighth final for two seasons, although they have also spent huge money!
Given the invested amounts, we presented you 15 points ahead before the winter break.
This would be a negligence to our opponents and to the championship of France.
Lion and Marseille, who were not at the height last season, were “mounted” by this new PSG.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that despite all the difficulties, the result we won.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on the accomplishments of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Well, what if they say there is some “Golden Dependency”.
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and he’s hit a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves that he’s the Star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world-scale star.
We respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did is really exclusive.
This encourages others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with France?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from spending a little game time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I went out there stronger.
I can play good match today.
This is what I have hoped for since my baptism with the Blue.
We’ve taken lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we have to behave exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didi Desham in the head of the Blue?
They are effective for him.
He has good positions in the selection group for the world championship.
He is a strict coach, he is close to the players and inspires the victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
I would not want to compare.
Blan achieved his goal, he qualified us in the Euro.
I hope Didi Desham will bring the Blue to Brazil.
Good deserved niche (1-1), scored on October 16 in Spain - is this a basic match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, there were no such matches in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
Full opposite to the current monetary exchange based on central banks, the numbered transactions between the recipient parties c commission fees for their processing.
In addition to how often these technologies happen, a clear political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is simultaneously a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros ...) and a BitTorrent-type protected exchange protocol that allows to exchange files between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered from 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand sites accept Bitcoin for donations or as a payment means.
The price of Bitcoin, reaching a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to about $10 today (courses are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its virtual currency report, published in October, was interested in this system.
He describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "concurring with the dollar or the euro" and "like the usual currencies."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, as “credits” used to promote in video games that are earned during the game or that can be purchased (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook also developed a similar system.
But the exchange operations are always controlled and processed by any central body.
In Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are simultaneously accountants, auditors, currency emitters, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually occurs between two email addresses, like an email.
Only for each new payment the user can choose a different address, thereby providing anonymity.
The information relating to this transaction is signed electronically, using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoin used in the transaction actually exists in a public account book sent throughout the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It passes through the solution of a mathematical task sent to computers, which the soldier, like a temporary central bank, receives the privilege of adding this new line.
This is about the file hashing phase, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers will "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hacking" everything together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily check that it is right.
The transaction is thus uninterruptly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If for the purpose of fraud the user would like to pay twice the same topic with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the task receives 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize is regularly divided by half, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoin in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one hundred million, which leaves another reserve.
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in the computing capacity.
The life of the network has already suffered rises and falls.
The sites that provide Bitcoin services were attacked, and Bitcoin were stolen from the reserves.
“The fault used does not affect the protocol itself,” says Pierre Nouza, who recently launched Paymium, a real-time payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this disadvantage.
Big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the account and found that 80% of Bitcoin is not in turnover.
“Gigant sales” were announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works at Coinabul, which is engaged in converting bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of the currency benefits, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or non-contact payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions that thus comes out cheaper.
The owner better controls his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It’s only enough to indicate the address that can be “photographed and recognized” by phone, says Pierre Nuaza, confirming that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend of revision of hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal.
“Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take a while, but 2013 can be a turning point,” he predicts.
By the way, the ECB in its report proposes to review the various risks that are considered to be increased today, if the system succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What next?
The French troops left their responsibility zone in Afghanistan (Kapipis and Surobi).
NATO and the US must follow them by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to restore control over its territory, and for the Afghan people to choose their future, without hoping only on us.
We suffered mostly Afghan peasants, who we considered terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and cured.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was in the USSR.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, so that even jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbek, Tajik are joining them.
They are suffered, sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will no longer be, as soon as the West becomes more delicate.
The departure of the French troops from the Nizhrab base, which I observed from the heights of the hills planted by almond trees thanks to French credits, was in order.
Truck convoys and helicopters accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Taliban will not invade Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their unbeatable advancement from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between the various groups.
Taking them under control of the country was then perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for the darkness of these peasants, in which they were overcome by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved even today.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the present Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into delts capturing state lands to sell them under construction to repatriants returning from Iran and Pakistan, using huge U.S. subsidiary contracts.
They were discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the countryside, want a government that would not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave as those who succeeded in American generosity will leave: the flow of capital is significant.
The young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
State schools in the cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world, and that are watching everywhere.
There is an army right now.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, leading the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures to restore provincial friends who would not be subject to the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country, with strong local differences, should be to a certain extent decentralized, according to the pattern of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which existed since the times of the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, starting in the 1950s, and even earlier, is dependent on foreign aid.
Industry has not been put on foot, no plate is working, no irrigation system has been repaid.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by the thirty-year war, state control of the infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
This only increased the feeling that Western countries were present there only to conquer them.
Without energy for the processing of iron mine or mine on the site, without means of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no mining of useful minerals.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Ainak med field, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to escape the huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers in the province.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which imports and exports are largely dependent, regain normal relations on a good day.
The withdrawal of the French combat units ended on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: the lice for girls, for boys, the Faculty of French Language at the University, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "conquer the hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of combining assistance with offensive operations, the service of "military and civil activity" at the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public work and activities aimed at the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain settlements.
These works, with the intense attraction of the local workers, were able to help withstand the rebellion: irrigation, boilers, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection, and the increase in the area of peanut land.
What will we keep in mind about ourselves by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, very severe in these valleys, often located at a height of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for the implementation of small agricultural works coming from local communities in the province of Kapis.
To get rid of the rebellions led by foreign groups, what farmers want, as they told me, they need to provide them with a small non-military support that would be well controlled and directed to them.
Heavy Birth of the Constitution of Egypt
This is a new risky step by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it emergency powers, he decided to play the va-bank.
He announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final text on the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
Almost two years ago, Egypt is relying on a preliminary text, in which several amendments have been made, which weakened institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic bargain”, continuing to “breach this word” and “suppress the right”.
In the camp his followers are convinced that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transitional process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to refuse the intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, article by article.
For the president, this is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction is flooding throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American daily Times.
Moreover, the call for accelerated voting goes on the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Of you vote for my text, or I leave myself an extraordinary authority," which is supposed to be completed after the Constitution was adopted.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.
The majority of liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In the middle of November, shortly before the Constitutional Declaration, they knocked the door, feeling unable to express their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
To the required quorum, 11 people, the reserve participants, were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, was distracted by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around... time for prayer, as some committee members believed the time of the Constituent Assembly was wrongly arranged.
The text, which was still voted yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Object of general attention, article 2 ultimately remained the same article from the Constitution of 1971, which states that “the principles of sharia are the main source of law.”
The Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace the "principles" with the "rules" which would allow them to be more strictly applied.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a proof of their goodwill and respect for other members of the Egyptian society.
“Licemery,” the liberals answer, who see in it only a pire.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They specially point to Article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular in the check of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egyptian expert Sophie Pomme, this is alarming, since “the people called to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.”
We can observe the birth of theocracy.”
Many liberals, in addition, are thrilled by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be much less moderate than the current.
There is no specific religious intervention at the moment.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of civil law.
The majority of the lawyers who worked on this text are not the ulemmas, but people with university education, some have been trained in the French system,” says Alexis Bloé, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that “there may be a discrepancy around article 220, as the terms used in it are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to the “fiq” (Islamic jurisprudence).
And in the future, there may be a question of how competent civil judges are to make decisions about this.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized as it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers claim that they declined significantly compared to those in the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defence budget will not be carried out in the Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
There will also be no prohibition of trial against civilians in military courts, despite the requests of human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern over the text that they consider destructive for freedom.
The responsibility for wickedness is retained, and offending is now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Furthermore, no one of the articles is talking about the protection of women anymore, emphasizes Heba Morayev, from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television yesterday evening, the demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state, in turn, will go out on the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the pop of the earth and the sea of the salt
The Promised Earth combines the greatness of the biblical truths, the modern comfort and the originality of nature.
The AIF has listed the five most important reasons to visit Israel.
We worship the holy places.
It is worth a visit to the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that on everyone who enters this “kupel” the grace of God falls down.
And Galilee is the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water in wine at the wedding, the walking on the water, the calming of the storm and the filling of the networks.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
The most sacred is in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here go through the Scorpion Way or the Cross Way of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonius - Pretorium, - where the court was, and on the streets of the Old Town leads to the Temple of the tomb of the Lord on the mountain of Golgotha - to the place of the crucifixion, the Stone of Prayer, and the place of the funeral of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian Pop of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be raised at the place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree was grown, from which they made a cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wall of the Cry, left from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave here notes with desires that are then fulfilled.
Finding a vertical journey
The ruins of the Fortress of Masada remained from a secret refuge from the enemy, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on rocks in mountains at a height of 450 m above the ocean level.
And to reach them by their way can only those who are interested in alpinism.
The rest to this historic top is carried by an elevator on the canyon road.
And in the north of the country at a height of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, on which in the winter months - a huge flow of tourists.
From the foot of the mountain there is a bus shuttle.
The total length of the ski routes is 45 km.
According to the ancient tradition, on the top of the mountain allegedly lived pagan gods.
Visit the unique museums
There are approximately 300 museums in this country.
You can’t go all in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, is worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or the Dead Sea slides found in the caves of the Jewish Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It is also worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition are widely represented plots of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renouar, Cezanna, Cisley, Matissa, Modilliani, Shagall, Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the al-Basha Museum, which represents several halls of ancient Turkish baths with the mules of visitors and banks of that time.
In Caesaria, it is worth going to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no excursions and souvenirs shops.
Entrance is free and donations are not accepted.
The fifth - The Holocaust Museum or Yad-Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic part - a child memorial - was built to remind 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You are in it and you are in absolute darkness.
The stars die.
And the names of the children of the Jews and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
to heal
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the coast of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them has swimming pools, aquaparks, delphinaries and oceanariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is swimming even in the winter months, as the temperature of the water there does not fall below 21 degrees of heat, and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and it is swimming all year round.
By the way, this is the most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below the ocean level.
Lazarus water in it is a dissol, easily holding to swim even those who don’t know how to swim.
The landscapes around are unreally beautiful.
They are here to go through the course of treatment with the use of salt water - raps, and healing dirt, and to heal the health of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to bring in order the shaken nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Ancient Age
They are stored by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the city of Yafo on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it passed the famous Sea Road that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to the tradition, this is where Noah built his ark, and Persei saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists like to travel through the narrow streets named in honor of the Zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your sign, Fortuna will be beneficial.
In Yafo you can meet the boyfriends coming from all over Israel and even other countries on a photo session.
And in Caesaria - the city of King Herod - you can sail through the Roman theatre, "take" the fortress of the crosses.
In the Roman period, Caesarea was the capital city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilatus.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Tourist on note
When you go to Israel, don’t worry about your incomplete English: in the country about 30% of the population knows the Russian language.
Money on a trip is better not to take in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shakes (now $1 - $3.8).
The city transport is mainly by buses, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram, and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper.
In fact, it is a subterranean funiquer.
Travelling in all types of urban transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can ride with transplants for 1.5 hours.
According to the Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until the sunrise on Saturday, the markets, shops, public transport stops.
On Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only cushion food excludes pork, seafood, fish without cushion and dishes that combine milk with meat.
There are a large selection of dishes from cabbage and beef, soups and desserts, cooked on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta humus, a variety of sauces, balls of mole nuts - phalael, fruits and vegetables.
There are no dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
However, there are a lot of feeded cats that valely "go on their own."
In the evening they can be seen asleep even on the roofs of parked cars.
Butterflies love people’s places and do not give up foods.
The car rental, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 per day.
The rental of a bicycle will cost at 15 shakes a day.
Tickets to the museum cost an average of 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most traveling and resting came citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, which is 51% more than the similar indicator of 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Great and Powerful" to Moscow will bring: migrants harvest money on the tongue
As long as parliamentarians and human rights defenders argue that the law on compulsory language testing will be given, the country has already emerged fraudsters who trade “lipo” certificates.
Every year, 13 million guests come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to maintain the families left in the country.
On December 1st, the law came into force, according to which every labor immigrant will be obliged to pass an examination for knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the fields of service, housing, household and retail.
However, over time, the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
At the same time, we will have to give up not only the language, but also the Russian history, and the foundations of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed both to obtain and to extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the state language.
They are not subject to the law and people who succeeded in obtaining certificates and diplomas on education before the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Institute of Russian Language named Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, MGU, SPbGU and other Russian universities.
Immigrants will be able to test in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative for the introduction of the test was supported by both the Deputies of the State Duma and the FMS.
But the human rights defenders, before the law came into force, many times managed to ask in the press the question: what will it actually do?
What will change the obligation of language knowledge for both the Russians and the visitors themselves?
First of all, it will reduce the number of people suffering from “work slavery.”
A lot of people are now talking about the protection of the rights of labor migrants, explains the head of the FMS representation of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only the system of organized assembly will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems appear in migrants without profession, education, who don’t know the language, who don’t have medical examination.
Without understanding the language, the future immigrant is condemned to encounter unreliable people, who under the form of help will put him a "course" into a terrible narrow barracks, where he and dozens of his like will for months be drown without food and documents, sparking 12-14 hours a day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
“In their homeland they are promised one thing, and when they arrive they are deceived, they take their passports, they do not pay the promised salary,” said Talib Sharif, head of the head of the Ministry of Labour Migration of Tajikistan.
Don’t be ashamed, the resident!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics gathering for earnings in Russia, they admit that they not only do not know the language of the country they seek, but they also write on their own.
Of course, it’s not as much their fault, as much trouble: a few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik can afford to get even an explanatory primary education.
After all, their families have nothing even to feed the children, not to mention that they should be properly dressed, shoeed and equipped to school.
Growing up to the teenage age, such guys at the first chance are sent to earnings.
It’s hard if it’s bad with language knowledge, they are acknowledged.
“You feel humiliated and imperfect.”
Indeed, with regard to the law on the language, human rights defenders note one important point.
The test will only be carried out for those immigrants who have a legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of Gastarbayters still live illegally in Russia.
“Welcome, or Foreign entrance is prohibited”
Many of the visitors claim that getting an official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is in bureaucratic teachings and all the same language difficulties.
Moreover, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But fake registration can be done quickly and only for a thousand and a half.
The employees of the Russian police know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, and therefore cases of harassment.
“They ask a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea,” Tajikistan citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
“Flight, don’t scrap, buy a painting.”
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law it was revealed that not only migrant registration documents were false.
A number of “lipe” certificates about passing language tests have already been removed by the employees of the FMS.
Fake paper is printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they reached the new owners not a task: each of the migrants hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two times more expensive than the formal testing procedure: it will cost the working migrant three thousand.
In the fact that the main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the "shorts" cannot be simply purchased, both the representatives of the government and human rights defenders agree.
So far, the authorities can promise to the gastrobaters who have failed to successfully pass the test from the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The IMD does not take into circulation the illegal weapons market
The proportion of criminal offences with legal weapons is extremely small.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia proposes to strengthen the law against the owners of civil weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to the recent incidents: The shooting at the wedding, when there was no victims, and the bomb built by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban carrying trauma in public places and increase the age from which weapon license can be obtained - from 18 years to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, Irina Yarovaja, and promised that amendments to the weapons law will be introduced to the Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to tackle the problem by “routing the haeks.”
In the network appeared an open letter, the authors of which – representatives of various public shooting organizations – demand to give up the “absurd aggravation.”
The percentage of humiliation with registered weapons is minimal, said the Russian BBC service lawyer-criminalist Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the six months of 2012, 142 crimes with the use of firearms, registered in the internal affairs bodies, while in the same period, 1168 thousand crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the rigidity of the legislation in the field of civil weapons does not allow the criminal to go to the "black" market.
Now, according to them, any weapons can be found at a low price in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs says it controls the situation with the dissemination of illegal weapons.
From Factory to Officers
The "Black" weapons market is supplementing through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel in resignation Viktor Baranetz, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site receiving orders for weapons
The first is "armate or military trace", i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were shot by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” Baranetz said.
The next type of "black weapon" is stolen by criminals from representatives of the force structures.
Baranec explains that it includes those taken from the police warehouses and stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal "stalls" are sold from military warehouses.
Explosions occurred frequently in many military warehouses.
"There are proven versions that some of the burns were made specifically - to hide the shortage," the former military said.
According to Baranz, the manufacturers of weapons are importing their lept.
“Today, private weapons plants are growing, which do not resist competition on the international market and are throwing weapons from underground to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert said.
Another source of the “black market” is the trafficking.
A lot of weapons and automates come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is its own production, sometimes cushion, and a mafia was formed, which organized the flow,” the former military explained.
Where are weapons?
Experts calculated what is the approximate share of each of the sources of illegal weapons supplies to the "black" market.
The report was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and State-Administrative Design.
The experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Rostat, the criminal literature and the open data of the portals on weapons themes.
Most of the illegal weapons, researchers write, come from the army and force agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there "for the fault of officials whose work is related to weapons," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, 14% of cases occur robbery at the stage of weapons production, 5% falls on "black archaeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the weapons stores, who asked not to name his name, assures that the weapons found by the black miners have long been no one buying - too old.
Most often, as he says, for the new party sellers go to the military warehouse.
Through a bandwidth, a person purchases a unit, such as a TT gun.
It is sent to him, transferred through the container.
“He carries it to the city and here he sells 900 euros per piece with two stores,” he says.
“Truth, the police are aware of all cases, so periodically when a plan for the disclosure of crimes is burning, it is conducting a control purchase of illegal weapons from traders,” the consultant added.
“As in a luxury store.”
The seller and the buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the sites, the blogs until a friend who proposed to come to the Running platform, where there will be a person who will take me to the "country" where we will trade.
I only knew the price there.
Military Observator Viktor Baranec
To get the stool I need a acquaintance who has a way out, - says the seller-consultant. - I have such a acquaintance, but I'm not sure of it.
The sellers on the markets are there, but there must also come, conditionally, “from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to tell that his daughter’s tooth fell.”
I’m even getting a couple of castes through a person I’m confident of.
He also gives them only to me because he knows that I will not give them.
They are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranetz tried himself as an illegal weapons buyer in the mid-1990s, when he prepared for publication an article about it.
The schemes, according to him, have not changed.
He was given an album with a photo where it was "everything".
“I felt like in a luxury store,” the military remembers.
The buyer, according to Baranz, does not offer a cat in the bag - everything can be tried.
I, a potential customer, don’t just buy – we go with the seller to the forest, there we put a target.
“I’m given the opportunity to shoot, and when I’m convinced that weapons beat well, we’re starting to trade,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the sofa
The search engines on the internet are linked to websites and groups in VKontakte, where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
There is no need for any documents and personal meetings.
“It’s enough to have a certain amount of money,” he wrote in the advertising hat on the website “Buy a fighter pistol or a machine.”
Users leave their requests and ask questions.
Are the minors sold?
“There is no license of course,” asks the user “Ivan” (orphography saved).
"I buy T.T. Moscow" - laconically formulates the request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now dismantled an enormous network of substrate sites and who want to buy a battle weapon with a scratch.
People go like hungry fish to feed, and then raise coal in Siberia.

I’ve heard about such schemes: the site is usually registered outside the Russian law.
People accept orders.
The buyer is paying through the ATM.
"In response, they send a photo and instructions where the weapons are hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the public organization "Right to weapons".
Viktor Baranetz claims that by leaving the application on the site, you can stay without weapons and get in prison.

“People go like hungry fish to feed, and then grow coal to Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $100
When purchasing illegal weapons, experts estimate, you can invest in the amount of $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the organization "Right to weapons", the Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100 to $300.
We will have to wait a month and a half.
It is delivered from the long-term storage warehouses by the management of these medium-line warehouses.
According to the official statistics of the ministry, compared to January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia in general decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of detected facts of theft and theft of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Factors of fast food and supermarkets in the US
McDonald’s has a quarter of all American teenagers.
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has spread across America in the Walmart universities and restaurants of popular fast food networks such as McDonald's, Burger King, Takoko Bell, Wendis and Kentucky Freud Chicken.
So far, no one is going to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is intended to breathe in the early stages.
The actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages that regular Walmart workers and fast food systems receive, the objective of the protest organizers is to create trade unions in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year.
The shares began last week, after Thanksgiving Day, in the so-called Black Friday, when an orgy of cheap sales collapsed in America, capturing millions of visitors and sometimes accompanied by slopes.
On that day, some employees of the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists the company’s store, whose goods are counted on humble and medium-sized people.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from pearls, hunting guns and car batteries to dust supplies, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart employees are charged only at work.
The availability and range of goods have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to the critics, Walmart may afford to sell a good at a discount partly because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain of severe working conditions, for example, the lack of car loads or manual scanners.
The shareholders in Black Friday demanded a salary increase and said the cost of the health insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker receiving $9.5 per hour, this spending is not in his pocket, they said.
Scientists from the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises its average salary to $12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on the salary now.
If Walmart completely puts up the wages on the shoulders of the buyers, then every visit to the store will cost them just 46 cents more.
In a year they will spend some $12.39 more than now.
Walmart’s supporters note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage to the corporation.
"Black Friday" continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight on the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 goods per second.
In total, its cash instruments produced almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Dan Fogelman, a representative of the corporation, said in an interview with the Huffington Post website that “minor than five” Walmart employees left their jobs, and that the protests were all-in-one “a pioneering trick” organized by its trade union.
“Free cash!”
The protests continued this week in New York, where their object was not Walmart (they are not complained in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and after that he doesn't even give you hospitals and doesn't pay you for fair work!
Jumeine Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York legislation, is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but not much, and their regular workers are receiving $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less than them in this expensive city.
How to exist in New York for such money is uncomprehensible for me.
Once upon a time, almost a quarter of American teenagers, who worked for their trails after school, lived with their parents, passed through the McDonald's.
Few people saw this main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I’m constantly pressing on interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed children on it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum hangs a comment, the author of which notices that it is irresponsibly to raise children if you don’t know what you’re going to feed them.
Participants of the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on the 40th Street and on the Madison Avenue, demanded that cashers and fast-food cookers begin paying at least $15 per hour, i.e. more than doubling their current minimum wages.
They also demanded the establishment of trade unions in the field of fast food.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the trade union activists with scratches and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely facilitates their lives.
But covering the trade union fast food is difficult and for objective reasons.
One of the main is the unusual current of staff.
Disagreed
Protests took place on that day and in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action appeared in the middle of the day a demonstration at McDonald's next to the Times Square, on which several local politicians-democrats spoke, in particular, a member of the council, Jumeine Williams, who said: McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and after that he doesn't even give you hospitals and doesn't pay you for fair work!
Demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, the mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that “we must be friendly to support fast food workers so that they the fair wage and economic well-being that every New York citizen deserves!”
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food sector.
But there were only a few hundred people involved, and not all of them were fast food workers, which employs tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this iscra will raise the flame of the mass movement.
“Before cheating the brain becomes average.”
Popular among the fans of modern technologies the theme of added reality has recently been used to be perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First in the summer at its annual conference the current model was shown by Google, and then in November it became known that the patent application was submitted by Microsoft.
However, the conversation with the chief of the interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge Microsoft Laboratory, Sharam Izadi, follows that for the scientists of this company glasses, it is a passed stage.
Their perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with naked hands, creating virtual open spaces.
Please tell me in general what your research team is doing?
We are engaged in the interaction of man with machines, but at the same time we are trying to dissolve the boundaries of this interaction.
As long as humanity in the mass was stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes touching them with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and predict radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox plug-in and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is sold because everyone is interested in gesture control.
What else is waiting for us?
Despite the fact that Kinect has moved the interaction to a physical level, much is still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information input improved (the system receives more data), and the conclusion is not very much yet.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projective.
We need to release the computer world into our physical, to make it more sensitive.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, to the line these foolish helmets of virtual reality!
What do you think about voice management?
It is a popular thing, but is it not overestimated?
“It cannot be called a panacée – it is a matter of privacy, because it doesn’t always want to inform others about its actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own niche.
For example, to manage devices in public places we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not of massive, but of such expensive, short.
At the same time, the gestures were taken not by the camera of the device, but by a handbrush that fixed the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the clock.
But in general the future behind a mixed type of management, for example, gesture + voice.
How is it?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this gas bank?
You say and show at the same time.
I usually just speak.
It will be very difficult to recognize.
- That is, you want to make users adapt to what the machine can or can not at the moment?
It is not necessary, but it is a mutual connection.
I think in the near future we will mainly have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to determine the reactions of a person more accurately.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in the depth, that’s very important.
- When you talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you claim to modern cameras?
Lack of permission, depth or something else?
In principle, the present generation is what can be discarded in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get a megapixel 8 with a speed of 1000 k/s.
But it’s not in the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us – it adds work to algorithm designers.
That is, you need to remember not only the resolution on the axis X and Y, but also Z.
It is also very important the speed, the number of images per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s is openly small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betiches from our Redmond Laboratory made a touch sensor with a regulated delay of processing - from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would have a great benefit in my work of an equivalent of such a device, but it does not require touches, so that the images per second are more.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared radiator, and the second is a reflected signal receiver.
But now the third camera is, in fact, the usual sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
More cameras could solve the problem.
Or worsen it by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the curve location of the cameras and see how it will help in the three-dimensional setting.
As I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you don’t think that from the point of view of the daily use of the technology of augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time to walk, hold the smartphone in the upward hands, it’s not very convenient, but this is what I think: the hardest option would be the “passing” added reality, when on the basis of a cloud platform you could switch from glasses to the smartphone, the projection display and so on everywhere.
Glasses are a very personal device, in which their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time weakness - the added reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Imagine for a minute that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to a simple mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no tactical response!
The hands do not feel anything.
What are the responses your team prepares for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that supplemented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eight can be a supplement of tactical sensations.
Until now, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of substrate for image.
It perfectly records the pressure.
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at giving these "pics in the air" sensitivity - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasound rays in a certain point where the finger is, gives it a feeling, but while it is very weak - as if you were swallowed on your pants.
There are also bracelets on the back, which affect the nerve ends in the fingers - also a prospective direction.
Do you try to cheat your brain?
Make him think he feels what he should feel at the moment he sees something?
This is a good idea, we haven’t tried it yet.
Here is another task, which is to be struggled for a long time - how to force a person physically in a very limited space to believe that he is going on an open, almost infinite - we work on the concepts of running roads (not as in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
While cheating the brain gets average, work is still very long.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so attractive for the researcher – many things are in an absolute initial state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Petersburg's avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, in the avant-garde of culture and art.
In this top-list have already fallen brilliant art-scene figures of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, passing all-Russian famousness.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the epathic artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a brown man dressed in all red, which is found at the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, then on fashionable towels and dressings.
The paintings of Kirill Miller always gather the crowd of viewers wherever they are exhibited.
Cyril Miller is one of the strictly St. Petersburg socio-philosophical narrators, the creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller is a bright man of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - the beginning of the 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance on the streets causing a smile from the citizens, raising all the mood.
Recently, he took the charm in his hands and became a St. Petersburg charmist, as he mature for this complex role with all his divine existence, philosophy and images.
“Cyrill, and why do you still walk around the city in all the red, not in the yellow or bird, for example?
I chose the red color as a model who deals with the appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker and the society.
Although in society everything that is slightly not gray causes aggression and excitement of a bad property.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
When did you know that you should be an artist?
At the exhibition in D.K. Nevsk, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that this was my way.
Then the wave of old free informal artists passed, and new, free types were uncomprehensible to me.
I began to make friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gasine, which led to the Pushkin-10, and there was no more wave.
I am thrown into theatre, clothes, music, in all genres except words.
I was important to feel at the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I occupied the territory on Pushkinskaya-10, and there, until there was a repair, there was a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: NOW, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Shnura was brought with the project "Van Gogh's Ear".
Shnur and his friends sang under the fan light songs, they were in an enlarging trick, among them was the fashionable now composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group played live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg was the leader of many programs before the Hali-Gali times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went, and basic education and education he received from us.
Gallery "D137", the club "Griboedov" is a screenshot from the Art Clinic.
There our workers and forever left.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the prize was "People of our city".
In the nomination "The Artist of the Year" was named I, my culmination ended.
In new times according to the old rules it is uncomfortable to work, I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
Your work has a recognizable manner.
“Many of my paintings are hits, in them clearly expressed relevance and sharpness.
I will have a program exhibition, "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are an extemporary category.
I’ve been social before, now being such is painful and scary.
But in the clowns everything is shrinking, the tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of peace by totalitarian redress in order.
Now on clothes they meet, focusing on the external mechanic, not on the inner person.
And maybe you can't give him the hand and you need to swallow it into the rose.
And the fraud will be removed with the help of redressing.
- And recently we have seen you as a city charm. - The cultural city must have such a hero.
Who, if not me, they have to be.
Can commercial art be beautiful?
Now the commercial art must be accurate, tactical, sweet.
Disintegration of cultures.
Previously, people fell in the room, the Bohema loved one, the prostaki the other.
Now everyone has broken down into microcommunities, now it’s hard to like everyone.
I'm not a $100 paper that everyone likes.
Now you have to think who you will like.
Now each cult hero has 100 fans.
And to Stass Mikhailov comes a few thousand!
It comes to it, there the sex-social sphere works.
And on the cultural ground 300 people will come, and 10 thousand will not come, and as a result, less management, money, everything will go.
I have fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to break them.
In my youth I wrote such paintings that one collector had them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov hanging.
I started with the pictures that usually end.
The concepts are often confused.
They say: culture spiritual, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a culture man of yesterday, grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money for painting.
I am for this culture.
What does St. Petersburg lack?
Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: a official of culture.
But not everyone can do culture.
With the right kings everything was not so, the kings might not very much understand in culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are bound as we need higher experts who will correctly evaluate these experts and give them the way.
The flavor now flourishes.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are such artists who have to look for other museums.
What is St. Petersburg for you?
“Petersburg is not a cultural capital, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is soil.
And on our stones the art is difficult to grow.
We need a cultural ground, and we now have more writers than readers, that’s wrong.
Here in Europe a lot of people are curious. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have that layer of tones.
We need to make fashion art as it was in the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented by the grant of St. Petersburg
Born in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
The carriers of spacecrafts with land on board are going to search for a reserve planet.
To preserve mankind, the main question arises, how to continue their race in the conditions of ignorance or on the same reserve planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be conquered at least hypothetically.
“This is Venus and Mars,” says senior scientist of the State Astronomical Institute named P.K. Sternberg (GAIS) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus temperatures are 500 degrees.
You can only live on a large height or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
The approach to the question of reproduction in space began with flora.
Half a century ago, plants were experimented.
The four generations of the horse grown on the orbit did not differ from their terrestrial varieties.
Then - the excretion on the orbit of insects, small fruit mush-drosophiles.
In 1979, eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of immobility.
We get a completely normal bird out.
Then the problem begins.
“The problem associated with the fact that this bird must find support, he must stand on his legs and begin to move,” explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
Without finding support, the birds were rough.
And after 10 hours, a full atrophy of instincts occurred in the newborns.
The birds did not respond to light and sound.
The problem was that in four days they just died.
"And twice we scattered the birds, then we refused, because it's simply impossible to work with them there," said Vladimir Sychev in a spacecraft experiment.
With animals, the biological minicorn last flighted on orbit 16 years ago.
The experiment will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosphere "Bion" will only be gay persons.
There was a experiment with rats who had been sent to space with fruit.
In principle, there was not found anything supernatural.
"This was just on the biospatals, but again it's a single experiment, and such research must be carried out," said Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the spacecraft had descendants.
But the problem of reproduction directly in space is not yet possible.
An easy task.
Animals, losing the usual habitat environment, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike the animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens has an abstract thinking, and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was in Thessaloniki.
And the most precious thing in mankind is the female body.
Our Chaika has flown, and no one on Earth could say if it will survive after a flight into space.
Can she have a baby after this flight?
"Nobody has answered this question," said Vakhtag Vaknadze, a veteran of the missile and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after a flight into space, the first female astronaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
Andrian Nikolaev's father was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman astronaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who visited the orbit twice and even worked in the open space, gave birth to a son.
The risk remains.
We have little, the units are counted by astronauts, who after long flights everything has gone out, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, then it's dangerous even in orbit flights," the astronaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov said.
And yet, mankind needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protection against radiation, creation of artificial gravity.
The CPC hydraulic laboratory is a mandatory phase of preparation for the flight.
Here, in the conditions of zero swimming, astronauts develop skills to work in the open space.
Water imitates ignorance.
If for adults, the water is comfortable, but still a foreign environment, then for breast-feeding children, it is a native nature.
Little Ichthianders seem to confirm that life on the ground came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months in the mother's fecal fluid, it's easier for him to get used to water then.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first swimming, it takes only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says breast swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In the words, if for a born child the unwillingness is a more natural state, then for a woman it is necessary for gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in impotence the muscles of the abdominal, pelvic, the ability to pull out the fetus falls.
Well, let’s give up this, relying on genital stimulants.
You can, of course, go to a special room for birth, she will pull it out.
“What then?” asked Valery Polyakov.
The child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the Earth's attraction, the body does not form the skeleton and muscle system.
A newborn on the orbit is impossible, as an adult, to wear a special load costume for training.
He will simply be deprived of what he will be vital.
"And this experiment, which we will go with you, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled, completely disadapted person," - predicts the head of the committee for bioethics of the IMBP RAN Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a time, it will be a reality when the earthmen on their ships will go to a remote planet, which will become the home for their descendants born in space.
Head of the Head of Control and Audit Administration: The check of the swarts system failed on the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement industry, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the presence of quality legislation, remains in its application.
This is the statement of Miroslav Kalah, Vice-President of the Supreme Control and Audit Administration, from an interview for the site Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack," Kalla commented on the current situation.
Such conclusions are made by a joint inspection of the Czech and German supervisory authorities.
As an example of incorrect practice, the approach of Peter Nechas to the so-called swartsystem is brought.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs by checking - is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law should be stipulated in any way, and if it prohibits something, then the prime minister cannot resist the work of the institutions which are imposed in the duty to check and pursue the fulfilment of the obligations," Kalah said.
At the meeting of the audit committee in the House of Representatives, you discussed a joint draft between the Czech and German parties, in the framework of which the legislation on public procurement of the two countries was compared.
What was specifically discussed?
This is a parallel check that we started probably two years ago.
Simply speaking, it is about the fact that European legislation affirms how public procurement should be carried out, followed by national legislation and then also applied in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even with an unfinished check, interesting differences have been found - in simple words, the legislation in our country can be "accurate and unflawful", but in the practice of application we undertake Germany by some parameters.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more accurate rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you, what does it mean for you?
It is such a joint control that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of the laws, to reduce and improve the restrictions, because this does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the appropriate thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it is not the fact that we will this by reducing the limitation of orders.
Probably this system will be filled with "boxes" so that those who want to find slices in this system will find them much easier than if the limitation was not reduced.
You are talking about internal issues of the practical application of the legislation on public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization like our CIA (Control and Audit Administration) or does it work differently?
As for institutions, there as our CIA stands the Bundesrechnungshof, built by our principle, there is also a college working a little differently, but essentially both institutions function similarly.
In addition, powers are to a certain extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are auditing units and at the level of federal lands - in this their system is slightly different from our.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have government funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the federal councils.
What about local legislation, is there easier than we have?
In general, I’t want to compare without specific data, but in some sense Germany can be taken as a sample, but it’s not possible to say that it’s better in everything.
Is that because they are better in control?
Certainly not, but I repeat, I don’t like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even sample countries are facing many problems.
Otherwise, they’t get any benefit from collaborating with our office, right?
If we talk about domestic legislation, how have the amendments to the Law on Public Procurement influenced your institution, how do the consequences appear?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet manifested itself in our control work.
Since we carry out factual controls, some delay must be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future checks - we began to use our new tool "detection of the risk of non-economy", through which we extinguished 14,000 state contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will manifest because the limits change, the conditions of some types of tender changes, and so on.
Do you think that approval of this law will bring benefits or additional burocracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be “hard” and they will not be observed.
In the functioning of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - with the regional council) in the fact that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of the budgetary discipline.
Should the law be strengthened in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but do not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
This system will only create even more pressure on bureaucracy.
How to get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the prime minister said that the GDP will not bother entrepreneurs by checking the so-called swarts system.
Is the Swarts system prohibited or permitted?
The law should be stipulated in any way, and if it prohibits something, then the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the bodies to which it is imposed in the duty to check and pursue the fulfilment of obligations.
You can say, "We're changing this law and we're resolving it," but we can't say that we're going to pretend that nothing happens.
The law on public procurement contains quite strict rules, how and what should be formally carried out, and it is right.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
The roads are slow, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowed.
They are mainly passable, but somewhere with more caution.
The Karlovarsk End
This morning in the Karlovarsk region the roads were passed, but somewhere frozen and snowed.
The temperature fell from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should be slightly heated.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, only a small layer lies in the bottom.
However, on the mountains of the Mines there are about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information obtained from regional road workers, it became known that the places had lower visibility due to the cloud.
The R6 highway and first-class roads in the region are currently passed without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be frozen and slurry.
All roads of the second and third classes, including mountain roads, are also passed.
But in some of their areas still lies the remains of frozen and places of snow.
You need to be careful on the roads located on elevations.
Pardubitsky and Kralovogradecký kraj
The Czech Road and Highway Administration on its internet pages informs that some of the roads in eastern Czech Republic are threatened by ice, and on mountainous roads and roads located on elevations, there may be a stained layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers of the hole, which may form especially at the heights of the Pardubic coast.
The hole can be around Lancrown, Usti-nad-Orlici, Polichki, Svitavi or Vysoke-Mito especially on the roads of second and third classes.
The roads I/43 and I/34, located near Svitava, are processed with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Krkonoše and Orlitsky Mountains.
The snow layer is located on the roads located at the heights in the districts of Rihnov-nad-Knežnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Czech Republic today a variable clouds without rainfall.
The temperature usually ranges from minus three to plus one degrees Celsius, light wind.
Plzeňskij Kraj
The roads in the Plzen region are passed this morning, but the places need to be cautious and adapt to the weather.
The morning is cold, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places can be slow.
In places, drivers may face a cloud, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 is now practically unlimited, however, road drivers recommend to be cautious between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In the south of Plzny and Tahov may be frozen areas.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and in this case there is a warning in connection with the possibility of the appearance of scalping areas.
Drivers should be cautious, especially on the poorly used roads in the area of Shumava.
The Olomouc End
Drivers going to the heights of the Olomouc coast must take into account the snowfall on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red Hungarian seat and on the road in the direction of Videlsk Kršij.
In the night, the snowfall forced road workers to go out on the street, according to information from the road management, about three centimeters of snow fell in Schumperk.
In other areas, the roads are usually passed without restrictions.
“On the heights of Schumperk lies the remains of snow.
Drivers heading towards Esenik should take into account the presence of a snow shell in the Red Hungarian seat," - said today the CHAN (Czech News Agency) dispatcher of the Shumperk road management.
In the night, their colleagues from Esenik went on to clean the roads and they assured that the roads on the heights after chemical processing remained naked and wet.
In Olomouc roads are passed without restrictions, but in Sternberg drivers should be careful on the forest areas where the moisture remains.
Ustecki kraj, Liberecki kraj
This morning road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are some difficult places left.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or falling snow, the mountain road is closed in the area of Telnice on the Clinic in the Usteck region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the low, so on the roads there is snow and ice. In the low, especially south-east of the Czech Middle East, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mainly dry.
There are no complications on the roads yet.
Road workers report the appearance of the holidays in the vicinity of Shteti.
According to the meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - the whole day was rain and snow, the sky was clear at night and the colds began.
Disadvantages are on the main highways and on the I/13 route on the border of the Ustec and Liberec region.
Due to the sloped under the layer of snow, branches of trees touching the road themselves were forced to close the road in Telnica on the Bookstore.
Shimon Ornest: In the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is just one of the many alarming news that we, people, get so easily.
Together with The Tap Tap, we’re constantly joking on this topic and saying we’re the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell the readers more about this?
This is a national fundraising event that we are planning for over two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, the end of which was announced on December 21 at 11:10.
On the day before this event, on December 20, at 21:00, three concerts will start parallelly in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, hardly speaking, at the moment on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, whose timeline is 12 hours earlier than we have, the May calendar will end.
Who got this idea in mind?
Initially it was my idea, later we all invented together with our artist Gonzo Augusto.
Besides that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will one day transmit this world to our children.
At the end of the May calendar we created a unique collection of items from shoes, shorts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be purchased on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus backward to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other musicians, also performed the hymn against the end of the world, which is called "The end of the world is cancelled."
Will the already favorite YouTube audience sound the hymn on these beneficial concerts?
Of course, at the end, if everything ends and the end of the world will not come.
All performers at all concerts at the same time.
The gyms will also sound in the live broadcast of Czech television.
Words to this song written and played the role of Jesus in the video Thomas Ganak, participates in performing also Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also collaborate with other people of the Czech cultural life as we host many charity events and concerts.
We are trying to actively engage them with these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What is the profit from the concert against the end of the world?
On the purchase of equipment for the barrierless educational center STUDEO, for the sixth year we have worked with the civil association Tap at the Edlicki Institute.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Edlicki Institute schools and conduct fun and interesting events with them.
Students themselves have no means to go to teachers, and we are trying to provide them with this opportunity.
In the framework of the project of the additional construction of the Edlicki Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
There will be several musical groups and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that will be of interest to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irji Suhy will perform.
All details can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “grand” events in the future?
In May we will show for the first time at the festival "Prague Spring" and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
The next year we would be happy to have a performance at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would very much like to have a performance in Washington and Chicago.
With regard to the foreign countries you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with the road in terms of organization and logistics??
It’s not as terrible as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants on electric disabled wheels, their wheels have to travel in the luggage department, plus a large amount of cargo and boxes with tools.
Czech airlines ČSA and British Airways have always been perfectly prepared for us, which surprised me how many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went without problems.
Thanks to traveling abroad you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with disabled people, and so on.
What did you face at the present moment?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, in Russia we have witnessed that in the east it is still at the base level.
Compared to Prague, there are a lot of barriers in Moscow, and there is still a wild self-moving of people on an electric disabled wheel in the center of the city.
There’s also no such banal things as going down the road to a disabled in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that try to pay attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, should we constantly pursue advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of performance of which is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people to whom it affects.
In London and Madrid it is quite normal that people with a severe form of disability move on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, or anywhere.
There is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in the public life, in which we with The Tap Tap a little ahead of them!
Respect for the public or barrierity is one thing, but at the moment when famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers appear among us, then everything really begins to change.
Until these are single cases, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let’s go back to two years ago that in 1998 made you organize it?
I entered the Edlicki Institute as an educator, there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician and I play, including on the saxophone, I have organized an interesting musical circle with my colleague.
Well, and over time, as our leader Lada Angelovich says, it was a little out of control (laughs).
Popularity has only come in recent years, or do I confuse something?
It’s true, it helped us that we started to join the famous singers and actively work on the band’s propaganda.
We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can appreciate is actually as if it does not exist.
With the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have the goal of discovering the Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something unusual.
The show business is full of things that imitate each other.
This is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few things, but I dare to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, is regret.
But this regret is entirely excessive, because people with limited possibilities are not some suffering and all the abandoned personalities we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only provided they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities get something, it’s a shift not only for them, but for the whole society.
Has success been guaranteed by the fact that you are a strict leader as many believe you?
If we want to do the work quality, we must be uncompromising in many matters and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that’s normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic imagination and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they have to go to the exercises, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the way, they quickly lose enthusiasm.
But that’s what happens in any group that wants to work and something.
Currently, the Tap Tap group is composed of 20 people.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We are an open group, people come and go, it’s impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and will, our doors are always open.
It will take place a day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno - in the Fléda Club and Ostravy - in the centre of Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by the telemost at the time of the band's song "The Tap Tap "The End of the World is Abolished."
The aim of this project is to gather funds of 25 million kronor for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational center at the Edlicki Institute in Prague.
Tickets for the concert cost 400 crowns, for children under 12 years entrance is free. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted as the twenty-member of the European Space Agency as the second country in the country of the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ECA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ECA in 1994 and during the subsequent years participated actively in a number of agency projects.
But the journey to the space of Poland began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in flights to space, but this was not always understood.
I will remember, for example, the lecture of A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933 presented in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory the idea of his innovative work "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after a few years, Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Essno-Peltry and André Luis Hirsch Prize for "Introduction to Cosmonautics."
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), which was mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-famous promoter of cosmonautics, and his contribution was appreciated including by the fact that one of the craters on the reverse side of the moon was named in his honor.
In 1925 in Poland was built a railway drain equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a missile had to be used to dismantle or freeze the carriage.
Information about this dressing is known only from the press of that time.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about missile shells.
The investigation was carried out by the Department of Arms Engineering in cooperation with professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Moczicki.
The preserved materials show that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of the German troops the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photovoltaic fighter missile appeared in the specialized press, which was proposed by the engineer Rogozinsky, and the following year the work "Air torpedo missile and aviation missile-bomb" was published by the author of Lelyva-Kzivoblatsky.
Both projects were designed for military use of missile engines.
Before the war, all the projects of military use of missile equipment were carried out by the Timczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy, which coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of its activity the work ended due to the beginning of the war.
The following scientific work, dedicated to cosmonautics, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time about society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the magazine "Problems", in which four volume articles on astronomy are published.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that will engage in cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already moving, and it was clear that space research was a prospective industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (POA) tried to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of the POA became its actual member.
And next year, the first chairman of the POA Kazimej Zarankević (1902 - 1959) became the deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronomy.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the POA has made a significant contribution to the development of the very successful meteorological missile RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile to perform scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The missile, capable of overcoming a distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
The improved version of the RM-1A was subsequently built, and in the summer of 1959 the two-stage RM-2 missile was tested in the Bledow Desert.
This missile was about 1.4 m long, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high wind.
But in 1962 further development was stopped.
The inheritance of the first RM-type missiles was the Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was conceived as a two-step, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (defined as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed by the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A missile had a space of 0.4 liters, the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters, and the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight distance for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 was developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 missile with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to carry a useful cargo of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then the versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning that Poland joined the Cospar (Committee for Space Studies) in 1960 and the establishment of the Cospar National Committee two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space studies on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germanhevsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The abolition of the law on public work is not the solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court cancelled the law on public work.
The decision caused a vibrant discussion in society.
It will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is linked to the principle of free trade and the free, no-limited movement of private capital, along with unmountable financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the value of the labour force (wage) there is price tension.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the state in which the manufacturer through the delivery of cheap goods tries to stand in economic competition by "shaking" the cost of the competitor in order to take the majority of the market and thus increase his own income.
In a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either the transfer of production abroad, or the cheap purchases abroad, or the disappearance. The result is increased unemployment in those in countries where the cost of labour, compared to others, is high.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including for the unemployment it has produced, the inevitable expenditure of the state for social needs will rise.
In general, the situation increases the unwillingness of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate the social economic and social damage they suffer in the pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Unreasonable methods of private capital create a situation at the level of the economies of individual states when governments of countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give their own population on arbitrary private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes to the current legislation.
The goal is to economically force their people to obey the dictates of private capital, primarily in the field of wages.
This acts as a system of economic compulsion in the case of prolonged unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool to cut the rights of workers in the field of labour legislation.
As a result, the level of poverty increases, and at the same time the difference between the poor and the rich.
For several years in Germany there has been a public distribution of food to the poor who are unable to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is approaching a million.
As part of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constant cases where employed people get such a salary that the state must pay them so that they get a minimum living.
Such a scandal became known to the public in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all the southern EU states, without a doubt, lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline of social status are either forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to exist on the poor wage on the backdrop of society in the hope that a private investment capital will ever come to the country.
He asks where he will come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as the Chinese, the Hindu, the Brazilian, the Turkish, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, the African still work for the share of the European salary.
This applies to Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media have to say that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that the governed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
The private capital strongly insists that the state should not interfere with the economy by ruling actions.
Furthermore, it should be answered to the question, does not the private capital, now practically managing the policy and the whole state, act for its own selfish purposes?
The clear answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of virtually all-powerful and everywhere lobby in all states.
As a result, we have an unparalleled situation manifested in corruption, providing mutual benefits, in legislation where almost everyone deserves punishment, but it is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is that the state ministries, due to the lack of funds, assign the development of bills to private legal firms that are closely related to the industry.
The legislation is approved by the Bundestag.
The whole power does not come from the people, as the constitution of the Western type says, but from financial-powered groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly in such a situation as described by Appian in the “Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompei”: “The state has long been broken down, and the ministries are engaged in violence.
It is unlawful to receive mercy with stones and swords.
Charity and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote"..."the ordinary people did not ballot at all for the position of ruler, in the end one time the state for eight months remained without a consul" .. "They seriously began to say that the only rescue in this terrible situation is self-government and the need to choose an energetic man "..Appian thought it would be Pompeii, but they became Caesar, who ultimately changed democracy to self-government.
As in ancient times, in modern society prevail their own unconscious interests without taking into account the public interests.
Private capital is no longer intended for public purposes.
The current result is not different from the past: an unprecedented fall of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
Therefore, the cause of the rise of fascist and communist regimes we must seek in the unconscious liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal-type democracy can be perceived as a certain break, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the present elite is completely ignoring the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already observing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The abolition of the law on public works is not a decision or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further lower the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms, which will allow to strengthen the share of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
The Laboratory of Chaos.
“Nothing will come out of violence, and it can never come out” – Sting, the song “Scrum”, where the main verse of the reference is the words: “We don’t forget what we are fragile.”
"If my sons didn't want war, they would not have been" - Guthel Schnapper, the wife of Meer Amshell Rothschild.
The last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has caused many responses.
Some argue for Israel, argumenting its position by the fact that it has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support Palestinians, argumenting this by the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist state.
I don’t want to think about who in these periodically repeated waves of murders is a criminal, and who is the victim, in the end, today’s citizens of Israel, including self-governed territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation, and were not witnesses to the beginning of violence.
My goal is to offer readers to look behind the curtain, to see what the tensions that have been serving for 95 years (after the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small part of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are supported by historical facts, some of them are drawn up on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main engine of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is above all the history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear - whether these people always made their steps completely independently, or behind their throne was someone who directed their actions towards the intended goals.
It should be assumed that we live in a period when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several people, and that this concentration of money and the power that leaves out of it could not occur in the life of one generation.
Among astronomically wealthy families is one that could be seen as the head of a sprute (I don't know if someone stands over them, but that's not excluded) - Rothschilds.
A lot is not written about them.
of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 90s of the 19th century to stop the rumors that link their name to criminal acts in the higher spheres in whose shadow they were, and that always lead to strengthening their power, multiplication of wealth or at the same time both to that and to the other.
They have large packages of shares in almost all central banks in the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their shares, they lead or prepare war (up to the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Kaddafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian government took the central bank of its country into its hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of a central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began to issue his own (think - government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theatre.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the Fed (Federal Reserve System), was murdered in 1963. Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to submit to the Fed for the dissolution of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a plan of three world wars, created by the great Mason of the 33rd level by Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was to destroy the monarchic states in Europe, the second had to destroy the colonial domination, especially the UK, and the third had to lead to the reduction of the world’s population to approximately 0.5-1 billion people (this number of slaves will be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final capture of absolute power.
The method with which a group of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds works is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the foundation of the Fed, which was to prevent the recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to break the First World War through the assassination of the Habsburg heir of the Austrian-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Tsar Russia, starting the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, unfounded military and economic capitulation of Germany (there was no need for war to destroy the Tsar Russia) and, as a result, the fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the dissolution of World War II, the banks and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing on Germany enormous military repairs, which created a prerequisite for the radicalization of the poor masses, then it was only left to push the Germans strong enough, wearing the guilty and offering the simple solutions of the Leader, then to create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which had to play, and actually played the function of the fifth column, when the fire of the war was burned.
At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of the historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Sion).
The above-mentioned Balfour declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first confrontations with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War exploded, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was originally held by the bankers, or everything he did was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the premises for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, as Germany was provoked by military repairs for the Second World War, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create the foundation of the Third World War.
If the international banks succeed in disconnecting it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will become the victims of combat on the front line, now along with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of disagreement and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (taking only the sharp division of people into Israel’s supporters and opponents).
Who is guilty, and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where harassment generates harassment in the endless chain of violence, if it all began with the desire of individuals and their aspiration to world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers encourage people to vote in the elections of exclusively their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister Yastreb Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers politician who does everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to grow into a world conflict, and taking into account Iran’s control of the Hormuz Stream, which contains 20% of all world oil reserves (the shipyard is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
David Rockefeller said in 1994, “All we need is a common crisis, and people will adopt a new world order.”
The new world order in their imagination is the world of gods and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the burst of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every born body is implanted with a chip, with which it becomes an entity under total control.
“And he forces all the small and the big, the rich and the poor, the free and the slave to have a stick on his right hand or on his forehead, so that the man who is not marked by the name of that beast or by the number of his name cannot buy or sell.
This is what wisdom is: anyone who has reason can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and this number is six hundred and six hundred.
“Operation Argo”: When it’s worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist protesters captured the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the shaken Mohammad Reza Pehlevi, who fled after the U.S. revolution, who have been the protector of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not expected – it couldn’t afford to throw the chess off the board because it could root down the trust of allies in other countries.
However, to the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of theocratic regime, it was unable.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by a failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The prisoners were finally released 444 days after negotiations under the mediation of the Algeria government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran mood.
The defeat in Iran significantly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential elections, which ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After a difficult period, they ended their journey in the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them out of Iran, while helping the extravagant cover legend that they went out on Canadian passports as members of the filming group, searching for a place in the country for the filming of a science-fiction epope.
The combination of genres
The plan, which was invented by the "evacuation" expert Tony Mendes, demanded the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the legend reliable, specialized journals wrote about the film project, press conferences were held, the fictional manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of the operation have long been kept in secret, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
The Affleck film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "film-in-the-counter", the story of a successful tide, the affair - an example can be a series of films about Oushan's friends.
The film is constantly changing mood - on the one hand, documentally imagined scenes from Tehran (in the titles are shown iconic historical photos of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, the Hollywood breaks are relieved, crossing with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in costumes discuss the situation behind the negotiating tables, on the stairs of the institutions, by phone ...
Ben Affleck succeeded in making a re-start of his career.
The laughed actor became a respected director, and his game ceased to be the object of laughter.
“Operation Argo” is his third full-time film, after the dark detective “Goodbye, boy, goodbye” (2007) and the thriller “City” (2010).
At the same time, this is the first Affleck film that is not filmed in the director's hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place refers to the qualities that have exceeded the earlier films of the director above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows this in Argo, where Tehran will "play" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, with the reconstruction of real events - the entrance scenes of the fall of the embassy impress with their clarity, which also transmits the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when somewhere the story suddenly changes.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his colleagues in the scenes of the fictitious (fake headquarters on the Tehran Basar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the story does not involve a multitude of exciting scenes of cinematographic significance.
He works quite successfully with this few, sometimes something is thinking - there all of it doesn't look so elegant (the scene in which the phone call in America prevents the upcoming crisis at Tehran airport, and the pursuit on the rally-out line looks pretty imaginative).
The "Argo" disadvantage is the dispersion associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatism, it's a film that can be watched with moderate interest, evaluating the performance and retro-style, re-creating the thrillers of the 1970s.
But it catches hard.
However, this is enough to remind one, still in a known sense, living story, and to prove how overwhelmed the concepts of all-powerful and all-known intelligence services are.
Rules of swelling of air balls, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, the annual survey of the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop."
“We’ve been promoted by the latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40-percent quota for women in the administration of major European companies,” said Patrick Nager, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities that have already been raised for the nomination is the recent decision of the European Court on the unification of the rates of insurance contributions for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because for insurance companies they are objectively less at risk.
"Another incredible ideas from the EU workshop people can present to the competition by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place until the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The controversial EU provisions include, for example, the compulsory adding of biocomponents to fuel, which results in harm to nature, as well as the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury gradients only because they contain a relatively small amount of hazardous substances, or the cell size directive for chickens, which resulted in a significant increase in eggs this year.
Also criticized the actual ban on the use of the term "butterberry oil" or the withdrawal from the sale of classic lamps.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The All-European Apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic is now even under the threat of a veto defending the demands of its banks).
The lobby interests are the following: for example, the banana of the highest quality in the European Union should have reached a length of 14 cm and do not dare to show "anormal curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission was justified by the fact that it only harmonizes existing divided national rules that complicated trade.
Despite the resistance of some countries, the EU has still mitigated the standards on fruits and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directives will lead to dispersion of products.
A candidate for the win in the survey may also be the last year’s EU decree that the air balls sold must be provided with a warning that children under eight years of age cannot swallow them without the supervision of adults.
The EU has referred to U.S. studies that air balls during the game are a potential cause of children’s death by suffering.
Such a limit is now applicable to children under the age of 14, who are forbidden to swim in the festival shelves.
Fun ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning the European officials itself is quite absurd: anyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the delicacy of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, but must instead say "BURM" (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com portal, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists "The principle of non-intervention" (Laissez Faire), proposed for voting, in addition to a few of the above-mentioned absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the volume of food reserves on the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food reserves that may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the established amounts of preserved fungi, which threatened a large penalty.
The survey organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries because they have no seas, and the idea of granting subsidies for subsidy applications.
But these ideas arose in Prague, not in Brussels.
“We are in a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture Yaroslav Palas (CSDP) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called intervention procurement the state had full warehouses of stocks that had to be exported.
Because the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have the way to the sea.
Subsidies for receiving subsidies were offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Paul German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies had to go to the preparation of the subsidy application from Brussels.
EU: Strange orders are an exception
Although the decisions in the Member States are easily being criticized, the EU’s regulatory efforts, as well as the better functioning and development of the European Union, many experts believe, deserve more recognition.
A serious problem is, according to experts, the drawing of EU grants for projects that have no clue to something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which the Member States have achieved when discussing the budget.
It is exciting among the Czechs and that, like in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must struggle in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of struggles with the Germans and the Austrians, retained the name "Olomotsky cheese", however, "Tuzemsky rom", whose traditions in our country go roots in the 19th century, our manufacturers had to be renamed "Tuzemak".
It can only be called the foods made of trunk distillate, not of sugar candy.
In the official list of registered EU products, along with the world-famous cheese “feta” and “gorgondzola”, marcipan from the German Lubek or Parm branch, have already appeared, for example, Karlovar Sugar, Pogorzelitsky and Trishebonsky carp and Jatech Chmel.
Also the EU trade mark can be proud of the Pardubic peanut butter and gorgeous pipes.
People want me to safeguard the republic, but I am a lover, says Okamura.
Mr Senator, how does a man come to the head to vote for the post of president?
I don’t think I’m going to be a senator or a president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I’t be balloted anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been devastating over the past 20 years, how the thieves are shaken, people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I’ve been forty years old and I’m an independent person, not belonging to any party, I have no other way to influence things than to vote for the post of senator or president.
You came to the Senate, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Do you not turn your back to the people who have chosen you?
I’ve always said I’m going to be involved in the struggle for the presidential castle depending on the result of the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I were elected as a senator, I would be voting for the presidents.
My goal is not a position, a position is an instrument with which I can realize my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the broadest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we, as a nation, are going to the bar or the television, but are ready to break down anyone who will try to change something.
This is added to the media that blackens a person, and that confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For instance, I was told that I was a journalist, or that I was a counselor to Irji Parobek.
Let us go to your views.
The struggle for the presidential castle you started with the theses on the material and criminal liability of politicians and on the reverse property declarations for the amount of more than twenty million.
To do so, it is necessary to change the law.
As a president, you do not have such powers, and only the whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this task?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed to make excursions a free business, it managed to advance.
The problem lies in politics - when someone comes with a good proposal to the left or the right, he is deliberately hindered, and that hindered citizens.
As an independent non-party person, I have a much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country, and apply it without a party layout on the roofs, without a look at the dogma.
Do you consider yourself a person more related to the right or the left?
From the Czech point of view, I think people refer to me rather to the left.
It doesn’t matter, a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for me to move forward.
It’s not about someone to the right, but someone to the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good solution for society, whether it is proposed by the CPC or the GDP, and I will also be against the bad idea.
You’re angry when someone says you’re a popular.
But do you not prove this by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And you are trying to get closer to that.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about are already functioning in the world, or they are spoken by prominent experts.
But without the support of the parliament you will only have slogans.
In politics, you will not last long.
Or do you think that when you come out to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other possibility.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to move them to our side so that we can our own.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to organize a direct television broadcast in which I appeal to Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliament.
And if they refuse, they will have to tell you why they do not want it.
If there is a strong person who will sound abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take direct presidential elections - it was a merit of pressure from the public.
I say directly that I am an amateur, not a genius and not an intellectual.
I am looking for allies to defend my beliefs and opinions.
I am just a beginner in politics and I will try to get the support of the majority for my program.
I try to promote things myself; if it fails, in six years I will finish and return to the private sector.
This partially sounds as if Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that one I’m not going to do anything, so I passed a number of famous people with a proposal to vote for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchure, he refused because of a large amount of work.
Also, I at least supported the investigative journalist Jan Lorenzov, who revealed fraud with light fuel oil products.
I presented my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel on weight.
Sixteen percent of people didn’t go to the election, and the majority of those who went chose representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independent members in the Senate.
The people chose the Senate so that the changes will be done hard.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections of mayor and governor.
Do you think about creating your own party?
I didn’t think about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the purity of the past of every potential supporter, and I don’t have money for it.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account only twenty thousand crowns.
Do you have no money?
You are talking about property statements, and how are your own affairs with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have an area in Prague worth approximately 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth approximately 10 million, Aston-Martin worth 3.5 million and Skoda Superb worth a million, and a few more millions on account.
By the way, Aston-Martin appeared to me because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond who was driving in a car, who was talented with women and at the same time fought against foolishness and unlawfulness.
Are you traveling to Aston Martin, you own a property of 60 million and you don’t have money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
This is not very convincing.
I have no $15 million for the campaign.
Should I get in debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors indicates that my program is not so interesting.
I don’t have to pay for the election campaign from my pocket.
The campaign costs will be covered by the senator’s salary.
But for that money I’t live, for example, I’t be able to pay my son for English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I’t have balloted anywhere.
So, will you continue to engage in business so that you can live?
Did you not say that you would reduce this activity?
But it doesn’t depend on the amount of salary.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activity.
For example, the director of the tourist agency will be my deputy in the spring.
People would want me to be a silverless man who will keep the republic.
I also need to live for something.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to receiving a month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, what I get on and on.
If I had become a president, I would have finished my business.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday newspaper "Law".
MVRDV architects prove that real adventures happen not only in imagination - on the example of Spacenis and his recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
“This building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again,” says Lizette Verheim, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT expert at the nearby large enterprise, says, “No, this building is really beautiful.”
But I wonder why we have another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, the iPad and the e-books.
Now no one is voluntarily going to such old fashion libraries, right?
Spacenice, a small bed town under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To tackle this annoying circumstance a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on the euro bills, in the form of painted iron-beton miniatures.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they had the only opportunity to overcome statistics: to build a library here!
Winnie Maas from the Rotterdam Architecture Bureau MVRDV, a master of brave column diagrams and author of smart, sometimes even cynical buildings, approached the task with its usual immutability and appeared at a competition audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and a fault on the face.
And while the jury members looked into confusion and pressed their shoulders, the bold Maas put a pyramid in size from his original gift and ended his speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
This is my proposal: The Book Mountain in Spackenis, so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain grew for 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes a underground garage, supermarket, postal and several adjacent houses and townhouses in a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second prize in the contest "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012".
The project also participates in the 2012 Netherlands National Wood Building Competition.
Thus, the unpersonal countryside, which before could offer nothing but a post-modern pedestrian area and a surprisingly unpleasant countryside, whose white facades suggest a milk plant, became richer in one modern architectural work.
But most importantly, the first public building of cultural purpose in the history of this town appeared in Spackenis.
The long way to the book
The first impression: the book Eldorado under a cheese bag.
There is only one elevator passing through the center of the mountain mass, because real architecture and reading fans will prefer to explore this area by foot.
Located from all sides, the room is bright and easily visible, the floors of burned rubber and the elegant street lights make a sense of public city square.
The city environment is perfectly restored.
The look is unwillingly searching for cats, dogs and football boys and girls.
And everywhere there are books, books, books.
“Generally, the book plaques stand along the facades, and in the middle is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and unpersonal,” says Vini Maas.
We set the classical configuration of space from foot to head and pulled out the reading zone from inside to outside.
The inner space of the book mountain is used skillfully: in the center are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical premises.
Particularly pleased are the black book rows, which serve the decoration of the walls, the parapets, and the staircase perils.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even tempted architects and engineers-builders are lost in guessing what this is for unknown material.
“We’ve been looking to work with secondary materials,” explains Yop Trauborst, the project manager representing the Spacecense community, in accordance with the standards.
And once at one farming plant in Florence we met a suitable agricultural side product.
For many years in the greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, artificial fiber material of a millimeter thickness has been used as a roots.
It is cheap and saves time.
The thin textile serves one or two seasons, after which it can be removed.
For the library, this plate - for the first time in such volumes - was pressed into a panel of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the action of heat and pressure, the so-called landbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, robust material, smelling a little like a new car and a little crossing.
It has 105 steps to the top.
Whoever surpasses a path of 500 meters will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and wooden figuers in the bushes.
They take care of the atmosphere, and first of all the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Expenses for a new soul
“It’s hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a sample project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The heat of the earth is used for its heating and cooling.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass hole, even in clear days the sun falls in only a short time.
Large wood farms, located perpendicularly on the glass facade, give shadow and take on most of the solar rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The remaining protection is provided by fully automatic rolling curtains.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned IT skeptic, has already visited a new library.
Lizette Verheim was also here.
As well as teachers of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "the Spacenis's soul that has long been missing."
The reason: a few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to donate one book from his own collection.
These books had to occupy empty places on the plots of a not fully compiled library – at that time it had 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The fields are placed upward.
“There’s nothing worse than a half empty library,” says architect Vinny Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation now every resident is somehow connected to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it serves only for jewelry.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which on the professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Spacey wrote his literary story.
Let them be very young and uneducated.
This is just the starting point for building identity.
Sabo: “Germans should play a more important role”
Germany refused to vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: In the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinians' request for the status of an observer at the United Nations.
But then Berlin refused to vote.
Why ?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israel’s actions in Gaza.
Now Germany needs to be cautious with regard to its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position as well.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without being too critical to Israel.
During the Rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also refused to vote on the introduction of a flight ban zone.
At the end, NATO made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international matters?
Yes, it is so.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, i.e. passing from the policy that, so to say, was governed by the United States, to the German foreign policy itself.
Moreover, the situation is complicated by the lack of a concerted common policy for Europeans.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to it.
I think they’re just realizing their role, but they’re on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
This is the foreign policy of France or the UK.
What does “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
This is the willingness to take a position in their national interests that does not depend on the position of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and connections with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany differ significantly from the interests of other major states, and therefore Germany must defend its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has major sales markets in the Middle East, in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it needs to be cautious not to offend the public and the elites in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its role.
But I’t give it too much importance, it’s not a completely unilateral connection.
But in any case, this plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by refusing to make important decisions, such as voting for Palestine?
I am confident that in Europe and even in the United States, the understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don’t think that was as dramatic as in the Libyan matter.
Maybe Germany will even gain some respect in this way.
After all, this signals that she should be taken seriously as a player on the international arena and that her interests should be considered.
There are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the contrary, clearly voted for the veto.
Is there any differences between the United States and many European countries?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama government in the depth of heart has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But in the context of the local political situation, the government of course cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that substantial differences in opinions are not as significant as usual.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then notice that Obama is not enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policy at all.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think this is what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a unified, non-controversial European policy, but now it is not so.
Therefore, they cannot act within a wider approach and are forced to act instead, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in developing a common European position.
It’s clear that it’s not easy for Germany, at least because of its relations with Israel.
This topic has always been crazy.
But I think the Germans are clear that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not really take on its main role?
Is it hard to give Germany a leading role?
Germany has not yet used to it, it is always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is always difficult to play a significant role.
Let’s consider, for example, the euro crisis – every time Germany takes on an important role, a variety of anti-German feelings are manifested.
The Germans do not just deal with it.
In fact, it’s a old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is much harder than the United States.
It should take into account the various neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, the influence of the United States in European policy is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don’t like it, it’s unpleasant, or it’s increasing unlove to you – that’s life!

"Tags Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
What is Armani Polo?
This is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from whose names it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names submit a claim.
But it is still unclear whether they will defend their rights.
“Foreigners are becoming more and more difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Patthloch, Taylor Wessing’s lawyer specializing in trademarks in the Far East.
Every week there is a new case on my table.
Emitors are sufficient to add only a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci comes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
The same method is legally copied by German companies, such as the manufacturer of sports goods Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with records of the trade mark registration agency in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name, which also uses the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are the world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities there are multi-storey uniforms that sell almost exclusively falsifications.
But the case of Pattloch is not that. According to the order of his trusters, he opposes that Chinese enterprises fully officially receive from the registration agency the right to use a name that is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it “ban minpai”, a passenger brand.
This word is associated with “Ban Dukan”.
This is the name of women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not guilty.
“It damages the business, it is necessary to fight with it,” Pattloch is convinced.
“The brand is wiped out, the unique position is lost, the image suffers very much.”
Financial losses and processing costs in the affected industries are estimated by millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China, with a sales volume of €15 billion a year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury items.
However, achieving the removal of doubtful records in the register of trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive.
The process can last up to nine years, with unclear outcome.
Pattloch tells about the cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits, as after a long time the contested name became a "market reality."
If the applicant is not lucky, he will even have to pay the plagiator, as he has damaged his trade mark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
There are also famous stories about graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a court dispute with the manufacturer of construction machines Sany, a company that recently previously acquired the firm-producer of concrete dishes Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The company that bought the Volvo, Geely, originally used a blue-white logo that resembled the BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to the imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose famous crocodile looked on the other side.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The CTMO trade mark registration agency in Beijing confirms that in 2010 there were difficulties due to the lack of staff and equipment.
But last year there was a "return from the emergency in the work process to the normal."
So, the number of untreated cases on objections decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, 75% more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still waiting for production in the department.
Fighting this is expensive.
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million signs protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has ranked the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the agency.
The same applies to the total number of actual trademarks, just 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan fees were paid.
If simplified, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Protesting it costs many times more, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has fought against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans succeeded in achieving that the illegal production of their counterfeit car parts was eliminated.
However, the imitator seized the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trade mark.
This was its own abandonment as the names in Germany are not protected, says Hannah Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trade mark registration agency rejected Munich’s claim.
Indeed, in both the following instances Freudenberg won, but the opposite side continues the struggle so far.
We need to be attentive
The issue is currently being discussed at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the ships.
But he also says, “The process is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves.”
The internal costs are unlikely to be taken into account, the firm’s archive had to review even the acts of a hundred years old to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unresolvedly proposed to the opposite party "a large six-digit amount in euros" for the settlement.
“It is clear from here how expensive it costs us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East are threatening to spread even to Europe.
Especially if the imitators register unprotected trademarks there.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and skin products.
The group has long stopped production in these areas, but despite this it was able to prevent registration.
“We need to be waiting,” Wentzler says.
Both he and the lawyer Patloch recommend German companies to be very cautious with China.
It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, rather foreigners should "all that is worth protecting in any way, register also in China," Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his drama about the trade mark, he will have to pay the opposite party the license fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we will be pulled out of the market in the controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: to swim, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the Chor of Imbonga is exercising - and in Swaziland, the AIDS orphans are pleased with it.
The history of relations overcome a distance of more than 8733 kilometers.
First, it is divided: cowboy shoes, basketball shoes, women's boats and men's tapes pick the tact on the parket floor and quickly find it.
Two to three to four.
Only after this slowly grow the voices of singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - they come, charm and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old driver, is just jumping out of his mother-made shoes when he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the chore of Imbongi re-exercises a new song.
50 participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from a human genetic specialist to the palace.
"Om"Obani" is a simple thing, each voice of the chorus has its own text, in addition to it in a completely strange language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Assistance for self-help
According to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are around 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Switzerland.
More than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitgeny, the Voices for Africa has found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend a school preparing for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take on the bossy.
It guarantees the child money for school, school shape and daily hot lunch in the Gogo Center.
Imboung in Zulu language means a narrative or a praise.
In this room they don’t speak running on the band, but they know how to sing.
For ten years, the chore has been teaching songs in this strange soft language and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared: to the south of Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers of summer from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitgeny, which depends on the voices of the German chorus.
40 percent infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple hills made of grain and salmon, among the inhabitants many children.
More than 300 of them remained without parents who died of the HIV virus.
A miniature reflects the disease of Switzerland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Cut of the extreme body in men, which has been proven to decrease the risk of infection by half, is almost unacceptable among the population.
More than 40 percent of the population of Swaziland is carried on an immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth decade is not rare.
Hor opened this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants of Imbogni saw a lot of children on the streets that lacked not only parental care, but just everything: food, clothes, education.
Without school education, a man in a poor country has no chance at all.
Initially, it was a private commitment of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity once a day to receive hot food.
But a year later the chor founded the association “Voices for Africa”, which since then almost professionally takes care of the AIDS orphans in Esitgeny.
Facts about infections transmitted sexually
What are the most important diseases transmitted sexually?
The bacterial IPP includes syphilis, chlamydia and trippers (gonorrhea).
The common HPV viruses are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Locked pediculosis and scrotum belong to the parasitic IPPP.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute follows that at least in four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sexual intercourse between men.
In heterosexual adults, the common diseases that are sexually transmitted are chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (grapes), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low - however, about 20 percent of new HIV infections belong to this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are significantly more common than among other groups of population.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
The human papilloma virus is also frequent among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all diseases transmitted by sex are subject to mandatory registration.
The rate of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011 there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the previous year.
What are the symptoms indicating a genetic disease?
In infectious diseases, ulcers can occur in the genital area, complaints of urination, excretion, pain in the bottom of the abdomen, as well as bubbles or tightening.
However, often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide a 100% protection.
After all, partially pathogens of diseases transmitted by sex can also spread through contact infection and with close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, especially with frequent change of sexual partners.
With early diagnosis, the majority of IPPP can be cured and remote consequences can be avoided.
Leadership, donations and not least the honors for the chorus performances throughout Germany allow something to gather.
“We’ve already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitgeny,” says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village with money from Germany, Codva Dlamini is a conscious and active woman.
She also takes care that the orphans are well arranged, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as called in Zulu’s old women, is the support of the village.
Some of them take up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and take care that children in shape appear on time every day.
Those who have no relatives come to the shelter to Hanisille, a single woman receiving a salary from the association, as well as two snacks that they prepare for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, the Association "Voices for Africa" organized a dressing school, built two smokers and jointly with the U.S. health organization PSI organized the HIV analysis for many inhabitants of the village.
It’s hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, they prefer to silence deeply.
The King with 14 Wives
“AIDS is an absolute tabu,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it is related to sexuality.”
It is quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswat III, is known for his love for excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a state-sanctioned lifestyle is also guilty of the fact that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in the past years.
But it lies also on the brody workers who spread the virus throughout the country.
Free preservatives are literally in every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are almost not used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh.”
To support a little cultural exchange, the Ibbogni chor every two or three years makes a trip to South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, battle spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness that many on the southern edge of the black continent know since the times of the apartheid.
The bus, full of white people who sing songs in black language - such a recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, it happened, caused tears in the eyes of severe border guards.
The trip always leads also to Esitženi, where singers visit the underground children.
Despite the fact that a small village is hard to find on the map, it is more than well known in the Etsulven River Valley.
“Go to Esitjen, there is the light,” the people here say.
And after a 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the swallowing singers return to the test hall on the Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light burns also here.
NASA opens ice on Mercury
The messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover can have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is the closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as follows from three studies published on Thursday in the special journal Science.
The messenger probe has found evidence that the constantly shadowed region of the planet is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and even up to 20 meters.
It is supposed that water comes from a comet or a asteroid that collided with Mercury.
No one connects the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said scientist head of the sonde Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building elements of life went into other places in the solar system.
Invisible for Earth residents are the sonds, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to the Earth: small cracks into infinite cracks.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, as well as the carnivorous planet Cerera.
Like Pluto, which rotates around the Sun after Neptune, Ceres, according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union from 2006, is not a “planet.”
This fragment of the infrared telescope "Spitzer" represents a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue spots, it is harder to identify in the star circle pink "newborn" stars.
This region of star formation - scientists unromantically call it W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This overwhelming heat of a dying star was photographed by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
A pony-like ring consists of the material that the star has thrown out in the process of death.
In the giant Nebula of Triphid, 5400 light years away from Earth, new stars arise from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope made this photo of the galaxy birth hall.

This new star in all its beauty was able to be photographed only with the help of infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they arose is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Probably it is Saturn's moon, which disappeared tracelessly 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and clearest images of the Hubble telescope: the Vodorot galaxy
Depending on the color transmission, the images of the spiral galaxies are transformed into real works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows a few thousand light-years away Trifid nebula in the constellation of the Shooter.
The name trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-dollar, three-divided), as the dark stripes of dust divide into three parts the scattered heart of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed a prehistoric of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light years from Earth, the nucleus of the two fusioning galaxies are facing each other and inevitably collide.
This birth of the star Hubble telescope was recorded in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who don’t like the technical shortcuts can call it by the pronouncement of “South Cube Wheel”.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of Iris' cloud in the constellation of Cephée.
The cloud, which is 1,400 light years away, consists of dust particles, the size of which is ten to a hundred times smaller than the normal domestic dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a black hole ring that is 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
The large spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star cloud is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star crossing constantly creates new stars.
This star cloud, connected to the Nebula of the Rosetta, also constantly creates new stars – at a distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
This bright galaxy with a small black hole still has no dust, only gas.
Researchers suggest that it occurred shortly before the Big Bang, when there was mainly hydrogen in the universe.
Our views into the universe: the most important telescopes
Probably the telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersge, even before Galileo Galilei began to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become more and more - and their available space views are increasingly deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hall telescope at the Palomar Observatory under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror shown here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, a large binocular telescope is installed.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Grand Telescope Canarius has a giant internal device - the diameter of one mirror is 10.4 meters.
The "Great South African Telescope" mirror in South Africa is segmented - for cost decrease.
However, in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
A lack of cheap constructive performance: the telescope is firmly fixed under a vertical corner - this restricts its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical corner.
Its characteristic: high light collection capacity.
It reaches – despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror – the parameters of the world’s largest telescopes.
With the help of the radio telescope in Arescu (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in the Project Search for Alien Mind (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
The Observatory of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the "Very Large Telescope" - fully corresponding to its name.
Its four mirrors allow lighting even the medium infrared spectrum in the visual tube.
The ESO Observatory in Chile is also planning to install a European Very Large Telescope.
Its main mirror should be divided at a length of 42 meters - and will be composed of 1000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected before 2018.
By 2007, the two Cake telescopes on the Hawaiian Mount Keah were considered the largest in the world.
There are two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Cake telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which, along with them, looks to the sky also using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope, with a mirror of thirty meters in diameter, will appear on Mauna Kea.
You can admire the illustrations here.
However, the most important species from space are supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990 he has delivered pictures of the distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the Solar System – primarily those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA that 1235 candidate planets have been discovered since the beginning of the mission.
The picture contains the latest preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space not earlier than 2018 on board the Ariane 5 missile.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it must look for the Big Bang through the light of the first stars and the galaxies.
Scientists suggest that there is ice in the southern polar of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data about this, as the Messenger turns closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the 2004 launched Messenger sonde – the first one that turns around Mercury – the scientists are now confident of it.

In southern Azerbaijan, many inhabitants reach a biblically honorable age.
There is a museum of longevity.
Looking for a puzzle in a country where 97-year-olds still seem relatively young.
The journey through the Tallish mountains can be called wild and romantic.
A micro-bus with a snorkeling climbs on a sliding road along the thick forests of hills, storms and simple farmers' houses.
Everything around is so green and bright that you can think you’re in Schwarzenegger.
But it is the southernmost edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers away.
There are talishs living here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, which is little known, except that they speak greatly in the farce and Azerbaijan and are distinguished by longevity.
The final point is Larry.
The small town is covered by the too heavy architecture of the Soviet times, which does not harm with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost don’t come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tired.
The 323 kilometers take eight hours, as the road has only one line.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province until it arrived.
However, Pilate Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerique.
“In May, Baku celebrated the Eurovision Song Festival – and next year we will hold the festival of the world’s oldest people,” Fatulaeva says.
She is the director of the longevity museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented a biography of approximately eight dungeons of talks from these places, which are over 100 years old.
This is my grandfather, he is 120 years old here.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the controversial star of the museum is the Chaban Shirali Muslim, who was supposedly 168 years old.
The birth certificate, however, is not.
And having regard to the fact that the elderly person, whose age is confirmed by the documents, was 122 years old, the age of Muslim seems extremely doubtful.
“He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973,” Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
Did the Chaban Muslim add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher from the Max Planck Institute in Rostok, heard about long-lived people in Central Asia.
“Awesome number of older people can also be found in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Huna Valley in Pakistan,” Sholtz says, “in Sardinia there are also extremely many very old people.”
However, due to the absence of documents, scientific confirmation of age is impossible, as there was no civil status records.
Each day a glass of hot oil.
However, there is a fact that people in the district of Leriq surprisingly often reach the biblical age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years old.
Why there are so many longhabitants here in the south?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mujimzade explains this with the special genes of the talks.
The director of the Museum of Fatulaeva, on the contrary, believes that it is a matter of food.
Thieves love meat, bread and most dairy products, many of them drink a glass of hot oil every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it a matter of the primitive lifestyle that preserves people’s youth? In Chengemiran, a small village near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzoeva lives.
At the age of 97 she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzaeva, who claims that she has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a bottle of oil, which without tired cuts there and here.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of the sons and daughter of Mirzaeva, who have long had their grandchildren.
There are also two babies nearby.
In the kitchen, guests are cooked tea, which is served in typical brown glasses of armute.
Mirzaeva has perfectly flat and strong white teeth, under the head she hides the long dark-rousian hair that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always have my hair milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
“And I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzaeva says.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what grew up in her own garden, tomatoes, potatoes, grapes.
I have never bought any products in the store.
Then she tells about her husband who served in the army.
The worst was after World War II.
But it became better when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev stood at the driver.
Propaganda does not often sound in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan practically knows no boundaries.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the rule.
However, there is no poverty among the ancients of Azerbaijan.
230 manats (approximately the same amount of the euro) Mirzaeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions it is the amount on which you can live well.
And,, the long-growing son of Mirzaeva is also right: “Old people in our culture enjoy profound respect.”
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
There is no reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word “human rights” does not exist in the Constitution.
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Competing demonstrations in Cairo show a deep division of the country.
The future constitution, based on sharia, encountered angry resistance.
The Egyptian president did not go to Paphos.
We need to make a transition.
“And his success lies in my responsibility before the people and before God,” he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but primarily to Christian copts, liberals, educated Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly dispersed in the misleading opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a religious state in the Nile on the grace of the powerful "Muslim Brothers".
Mohammed Mursi, almost apologizing, said that he temporarily cut off the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded his jurisdiction to "save the revolution."
But what actually wants to save a 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate degree from the American University of Southern California is not quite clear to Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be powerless?
In fact, 234 articles were able to go through in a 15-hour night race with obstacles to an Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this partially causes concerns.
As in the previous constitutions, the draft states that judicial proceedings are based on "principles of Islamic law".
What do “principles” mean?
This was and remains a matter of interpretation, and we can be afraid that the Islamists will use the scattered formulation and the resulting legal loft for a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
At least this is indicated by one new article: in all affairs related to sharia, the University of Al-Ashar should be attracted to the Council, the country’s most important Islamic institution, which has great authority in all the Sunni Islam.
This should not, but may mean that the priesthood oversee the legislation, that de facto would have a consequence of restriction of judicial power.
The draft constitution has a lot to be interpreted.
Another problem is that civilians must remain subject to the military court.
These courts during Mubarak's power served to suppress oppositionists.
After the defeat of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military prison.
Also, as stated in the project, the state must “protect the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “support its morality and values.”
Legally, this is formulated so unclear that public institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature.
Open text means nothing but censorship.
No article directly establishes equality between men and women.
But the other prohibits offending and offending the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what the insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also suspicious that it is prohibited to “insult people.”
Will there be enough caricatures on the president or jokes about the law?
The question of interpretation, as much in this project, which Mursi proposes to sign and which, according to him, “very soon” will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
“The revolution has returned.”
For several weeks there has been an opposition against the superiority of the Islamists.
Dozens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimously on Friday evening on the Tahir Square in Cairo and swear to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
“The revolution has returned, and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Department, Mohammed El Baradei, said the draft constitution was "on the slope of history."
On Twitter, he accused Mursi’s supporters of the desire to lead a “putch against democracy.”
“If he announces a referendum, we’ll go to his palace and take it down,” opposition leader Yasser Said said.
“We’re not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not rejected yet,” the Egyptian media cited opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Many judges also said they do not want to observe the referendum, which would make it invalid.
“The Qur’an is our constitution”
The well-organized Muslim Brothers, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, for caution, not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other shore of the Nile in front of the Cairo University.
A large number of women under the cover and the supporters of the salaphites were involved, who cried: “The people require the law of God.”
They asked Mursi, “Clean the country!” and they assured, “The Quran is our constitution.”
The struggle for power over the symbolic square, on which everything began, provoked the state of practically civil war.
The followers of Mursi obviously did not want to take this risk.
"Muslim Brothers" said both the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke loud and clearly.
Now it is time for the people to decide at the electoral urn in which direction the country should go.
The majority for the Islamist project, this is considered a resolved matter.
“The concept of ‘human rights’ is never mentioned.”
Hafiz Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process, which should have lasted until February with the participation of all public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOPR) defended the Muslim Brothers when they sat in prison or appeared in court at Mubarak.
Not because he divided their view of the world, but because human rights are inseparable to him.
For this he was shot, convicted, arrested.
And now the words “human rights” never meet in the new constitution, he regrets in a conversation with “Welt am Sonntag”.
The expansion of Mursi’s influence on all three branches of power in the state disappointed the lawyer.
These measures are a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president de facto canceled it,” Sayeda regrets.
Without civil organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community that looks at the ideological struggle of the directions in the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This may be paid for.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir Square warns: “You’re creating a monster that you can’t control.”
Norwegian rackfish: the worst smelling fish in the world?
The five-million population of Norway has one of the highest levels of life not only in Europe but in the world.

As the darkness and the cold shrink, the crowd of Norwegians gather to a festival in Fagerne dedicated to this, let’s say, fascinating dish.
“They’re eaten raw and drunk with a rubber of aquavite, a local thin vodka,” explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter in the profession and in the collaboration of the “Racfish General”, who leads the festival.
Everywhere around us people eat cut with small cubes of fish and drink it with large portions of alcohol.
“Someone likes aquavit more than rackfish,” Howard says.
This drink can break the smell.
I will try a couple of pieces.
If you’re able to carry a piece under your nose, then it’s not so bad – it’s little different from the portion of sushi that you’ve been on your bus for a long time.
Raffisk is a Norwegian product from a completely different time, times of poverty, when, before the appearance of the refrigerators, the fish in the autumn was mocked in hermetically closed bottles with salt water.
Then in the deep winter, when the fish was already well and thoroughly broken, it was extracted and, deepening the perception of alcohol, consumed in food.
Even in memory of the past generation is the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate, mainly, to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, who are trapped here by jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
The inhabitants of Sweden (a long rival, and not so long ago and a much more lively neighbor) massively come here to work.
Raffisk is perceived as some important symbol, an indispensable, though somewhat malicious element of the past of Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, here is all expensive - a small glass of beer or sandwich will cost you 9 pounds (14 US dollars).
Norway rarely appears in world news, and most inhabitants of the country seem to be pleased with it.
People here still do not want to mention the name of Anders Breivik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot down and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the terrorist attack is called "the 22th of July".
Norwegians are very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of their citizens has been capable of such brutality and murder.
The basis of today’s well-being in Norway is the growth (from the early 1970s) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“But oil isn’t the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our servant, whispering with a drawn rack, a woman with long, bright hair and surprisingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are such a people, as you call it, reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks well in English.
We don't like to show up, we're not praiseful.
Norway is very careful with its oil – the majority of the oil and gas industry’s revenue is invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years prior to the global financial crisis, when everyone was shrinking with the money they didn’t have, Norway carefully counted all the costs.
“As long as you can ski in winter and walk in summer, this is enough for happiness,” says Anna.
“And there’s a rackfish,” she adds with a foolish laughter.
I’m standing in the snow in a row behind some food – a raffination with me is enough.
Here is a hamburger with salmon meat - it's exactly exotic, delicious juice meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
My hotel holds a special dining dedicated to rackfish, during which visitors by voting determine the best or the most aromatic fish.
There is a direct television show, in which they show the leading in a gallstoke-puppy, surrounded by plates with a raffin.
This is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jurgen, what rating did you put for the best fish there in the mountains?"
“Yes, Howard, this is our assessment.”
Everyone laughs and praises.
Someone falls out of the chair, by taking over the aquavite.
Or maybe just breathing the smell of this fish.
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start of his career.
While the newly elected Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face, and the mixed expectations of the population of his country.
The road traffic in Mexico is now in a painful state.
This city is overloaded by transport and in the best time, and since Monday steel barriers have been built, cutting several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was done not to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will wear a presidential bond and take over the country’s government.
A difficult task is faced with him.
Mexico has achieved good economic outcomes under the administration of Felipe Calderón, which is now putting up its powers, but the country has buried in the drug war, which in six years has already caught about 60,000 lives.
"My government declares to the people of Mexico its willingness to fight violence," Mr. Pyeong Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the White House's oval office earlier this week.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to that goal.
Before such statements, the political career of Mr. Penny Nieto was developed alongside the U.S. President as the governor of his native state, Mexico.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and extensive state surrounding the country’s capital, the opinions about the new leader divided.
The straight man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
The inhabitants will benefit him from the revival of tourism, the development of the resort area and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Penya Nieto, which are significantly different from the roads with valvines and caves that were previously on this place.
The tables with its name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We link with him hopes for real and serious changes,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman from the leading Penya Nieto Institutional and Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive changes that are so urgent for our country, primarily in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous staying in power, the PRI party was pushed out in 2000 by Visente Fox.
The congressman of Olvera acknowledges that after his 12 years of absence in the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party is putting great hopes on Enrique Pena Nieto.
He also denies the accusations of intolerance that the opposition has brought to the new president.
He is very straightforward and very dedicated to the realization of his vision of the future of the country.
He is an excellent public figure and, above all, a person who knows how to listen.
But in the other part of the state many people had a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nessaalcootle, also known as the South of Nessa, is the most disturbing contrast with the powerful streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under the stacks of highways, it is in many ways a suburbs of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality also have the severe nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, troops were attracted to calm the narcotic gangs in these areas; and violence against women is sharp here.
In the desert near the extensive debris only in the last two years, several dozen bodies of killed women have been found.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during the governorate of Mr. Penya Nieto – this significantly exceeds a similar figure in the sadly famous city of violence, the city of Judad-Huarez, the name of which became named when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to the opponents of Mr. Pye Nieto, about him in the best case, it can be said that during his stay in the post of governor he failed to cope with the problem of killing women.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of completely ignoring this problem.
A resident of a concrete house, similar to most houses in this enlightened area, Irinaia Buendia hardly holds her tears, showing me the photos of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her cohabitant.
“When I arrived at her home, it seemed like her body was washed before it,” Mrs. Buendi reminds.
There were signs that she was killed, and the body was already blinded.
Mary's mother is telling this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall where she hangs next to the baptism, on which only one word is drawn: justice.
That’s what they say that this family was rejected.
“The state officials treated me as an old spell, an unhappy violator of peace.
They want people to simply believe everything they say, and to blame.
But it’s wrong, so it’s not possible, especially when around so many violations and misconceptions,” she says.
Having a presidential translation on Saturday, President Penia Nieto will take a difficult responsibility together with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violence-related crimes, and the new president has promised to make the solution of this problem a priority during his rule.
“I hope he will be exactly the same president as he was a governor,” says Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
But this is what the families of victims in South Ness are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning did not complain of bad behavior, the accusation says.
The prosecutors are trying to deny Bradley Manning's statements about bad conditions of detention.
During the hearing, increased attention was paid to Maning’s stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence requires the closure of the case on the grounds that the conditions of Maning’s imprisonment were cruel.
The U.S. Army is accused of theft of thousands of secret documents.
On Friday, the accusation tried to prove that the regular Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest escape of secret materials in U.S. history, did not take advantage of the many possibilities to complain about the misconduct he said had to be transferred while in military prison.
During a cross-interrogation at a pre-judicial hearing in Fort Mide, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said that records of Maning's weekly visits by the prison administration for nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not contain complaints of misconduct.
The preliminary investigation in the framework of the examination of the defensive request for the termination of the Manning case on the basis of the fact that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in itself were sufficient punishment, was carried out the next day after Manning said he intended to commit suicide while detained.
A military intelligence expert, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing several thousand secret documents during his service in Iraq.
This material was subsequently published on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks does not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During the hearing on Friday, Prosecutor Fein and Manning reviewed the reports that were filled after Manning's visits by government representatives during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was under strict prison regimes from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison servants asked questions to Manning and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Fein asked on Friday about the reports, Manning acknowledged he assessed the treatment by the prison administration as "excellent" and the general conditions of imprisonment as "very professionally organized".
The reviewed reports do not contain any complaints of misconduct, despite the fact that Manning was directly asked about the conditions of his holding, Fein says.
Manning replied that he expressed oral concerns about these issues and that his visiting administration representatives discussed these issues with him and stated that they would deal with, but did not fix it in writing.
"They recorded 'problems are missing' (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise this topic in the conversation," Manning says.
The military judge, Colonel Denis Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain of unlawful treatment with him in January 2011 during a committee meeting discussing suicidal intentions, which he expressed in writing a few months before.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to get rid of the "traumatism warning" regime and relieve the conditions of imprisonment.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that the restricted prison regime - to a level lower than the supervisory regime to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the security of others.
“I wanted to let the administration know that it’s okay with me, that they cancell the traumatic prevention regime... so that my level of life improves, from my point of view,” Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and transferred to Kuwait, where he was held for two months before being transferred to prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He that his thoughts of suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness due to a strong heat.
He explained that it is psychologically very difficult when you are not given to know how your destiny is resolved and what is happening in the outside world.
“My world was shrinking up to the Camp Ariffan base, up to the size of my prison,” Manning said on Thursday.
“I thought I would die in this cage.”
While in Quantico, Manning, according to him, spent most of his time in a small room - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - in full loneliness.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, a coat, a slope, a few items of clothes and glasses.
He says he was trying to move because sleeping or even just lying during the day was prohibited by the rules.
According to Maning, during his sleep, he was constantly in the eyes of a light penetrating outside the camera.
If the guards didn’t see his face when he turned into bed at night, then, according to him, he was awake and forced to turn back.
Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's unlawful treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Maninga was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made during the testimony on Thursday, that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his room in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked before the guards and other prisoners at the morning check.
Manning said he had no opportunity to cover the cover during the check.
Answering the question of the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he had to throw a cover that could be covered, but he admitted that no one had directly ordered him to throw it.
On Thursday, Manning said that the night before he was forced to sleep naked because he tried to show the officer that he was not a danger for himself.
Manning that he told the officer that he could use a strip of pants or pants to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, according to Maning's testimony, his underwear, clothes and glasses were taken from the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he had to experience during his imprisonment, and will significantly shorten the term of imprisonment in case Manning is declared guilty by a military court, which will begin his case at the beginning of the next year.
The Defence said it plans to propose to Manning to acknowledge guilt for less serious crimes, and other accusations to be disputed as excessive.
The renewal of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the accused party is expected to insist that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules that regulate the detention of the detainees with the strictest possible regime.
Among the accusations brought to Manning are the support of the opponent, the illegal promotion of the dissemination of data on the Internet, the transmission of information concerning national defence, and the theft of state property or documents.
If he is sentenced by all points of the accusation, he may be threatened to life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is a story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind residents of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin break between two cultures.
During my recent trip to Mexico, I went through the corridors for arrivals, approached the border control zone and stopped on the spot.
The signs indicated two rows: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (Strangers).
I stood before them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I was called a Mexican all my life.
It’s just a conditional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York call themselves Italian.
Later I stopped on the complex design of "American of Mexican origin".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex structures.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the speakers, and I can’t get rid of American accent.
That’s why I got my American passport and got the turn for Extranjeros.
I remember this story a few days ago when the newly elected president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were common issues for the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Penya Nieto was pleased to talk about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which the Mexicans will now, with the same success, be able to stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and to create a North American trade block like the European Union.
In addition, President Penya Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is a serious and fulfilled question of old harassment.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory.
But the Mexicans think centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only worth any U.S. official to be silent, even with a word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elites of the Mexican society, the complaints that the Americans violate the sovereignty of the neighbors are immediately spread.
And the descendants of Montesuma are filled with warfare.
Meanwhile, the most difficult is the relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about harassment?
They are enough.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in this country for themselves, and those for whom there are no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin only for one reason: at some point of their family history anyone — father or grandfather — had no opportunity to realize himself in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.
Most often, they were Mexicans of a certain type – dumb, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants and we remember it.
In Mexico it is different.
Today our life is the realization of the American dream, we studied in good schools and prepared for good work, but we don’t forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider its own.
the United States of America.
We also know that most representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not love us.
We answer them the same.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as people of second kind, as untrue Mexicans.
We don’t speak Spanish well enough, and our relations with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our existence itself is explained to them by failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they would not leave.
We’t be now behind a silk curtain, finding a filled life in the United States, but losing spiritual connections.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain trends between real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin: Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Americans of Mexican origin it is offensive.
She is a citizen of the United States and believes she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my well-known Americans of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springstine.
Having the best of the two worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico we are Americans.
In the United States, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I discovered during my trip as if our relations were not confused enough, some Mexican leaders and intelligence representatives want to restore their relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican origin to work as a kind of ambassador to Mexico and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends how beautiful it is and how nice it is to visit, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Ah of course.
Nothing will come out.
Too much harassment in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the gap of corruption and drug trafficking, many of us don’t think this country is so beautiful at all.
Sorry, but deal with it yourself, Amigos.
And that is fair.
If a part of the Mexicans can still not forgive the United States as they did with Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican origin are still insulting for how they have recently been in Mexico with their relatives.
Yes yes.
Maybe we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas could be a fragile foundation for further peace.
Is there a long-term peace between the Arabs and the Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion of the foolishness of such hopes.
It sounds usual, meaningless disputes about who first started; many buildings have become ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; for the first time during the conflict, missiles launched from the Gaza Strip fell near the capital of Israel Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly engaged in their perpetual conflict, the Middle East has come to change.
This can be regarded differently, however, the events of the "Arab Spring" have surrounded in the rebellion storm many standing realities, and the Palestinians and the Israelis have failed to stay away from the storm that shocked the region.
Per, as a result, their struggle will be even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons that give hope for a way out of this deadly fool.
War Without the Winners
At first glance, the situation does not give reasons for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, the agreement which was signed on 21 November, will be carried out, the clashes that occurred this week only strengthened the position of the forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will declare that they forced Israel to withdraw despite the losses they suffered.
Despite the fact that some leaders of the group were destroyed and 1.7 million inhabitants were blocked in one of the most densely and problematic corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is increasing its popularity on the West Bank of the Jordan River – another Palestinian territory now controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can come to the conclusion that time works on them.
As the influence of Islamist movements increases in the Arab world, Hamas has new influential and wealthy friends.
The emerging regional leader, Turkey, which was once the closest ally of Israel among Muslim countries, supported Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states in the Gulf.
Hamas celebrating supporters declare the creation around Israel of an Islamic Half Month – from Lebanon in the north, where Hezbollah is ruled, to Syria, where more and more Islamic rebels will throw down Bashar Assad’s power, and further to Jordan, where the king’s authorities are threatened by Hamas’ allies.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement was strengthened under President Mohammed Mursi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overturned in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay special attention to supporting Hamas.
Muslim brothers, on the contrary, are organizations much similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.
In future diplomatic settlements, Hamas may become a significant player whose voice will not be able to silence even Israel and America.
At the same time, the supporters of the “hard” line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
In the military sense, Hamas was overturned.
The Israeli anti-missile system “Iron Cup” justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the launched Hamas missiles.
The citizens of Israel can sleep calmly, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its unchanged position; many European countries also blamed the beginning of the last round of violence against Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially with the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who has greatly ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis have been killed by missiles launched from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the terrorist problem, partly by the wall that enters the West Bank of the Jordan River – a significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian State – and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Lykud party – in the framework of preparation for the January 22 election – united with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Liberman, is very convenient.
What does it mean to encourage the Palestinians and give them their own state?
If they give all the power to their hands on the West Bank, will they not start launching missiles from there toward Israel, as their fellows in the Gaza Strip do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and hardly suppress any attempts to raise the heads.
Per the supporters of the “hard” line will win; however, their calculations may be denied by the Arab Spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not experience the warmest feelings towards Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defense part of the Israeli budget is greater than all its Arab neighbors, taken together.
A war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of the Arab countries strengthen their own economy.
The pragmatism of the Egyptian president, Mursi, who, together with Barack Obama, worked on a ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel must at least take into account the long-term consequences of its policy.
As democratic changes arise in the Arab countries, the deprivation of the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a slow-action bomb that will soon or later explode on Israeli occupied territories, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression has already undermined the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect – the growth of the Arab population – only aggravates these problems.
For the bloody operations that are carried out every several years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement, the growing dissatisfaction of the international community has to be paid.
Both sides need external impulses.
The only solution remains to which healthier representatives from both sides and the majority of the rest of the world and our newspaper are constantly calling for: the formation of two states and the departure of territories by Israel in exchange for security.
There remains the hope, not too impressive in the short term, the hope that the ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the sides of the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which has long been time to decide to stop the supply of weapons to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as never before, a favorable position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of the virtual state of Palestine.
His role in placing Israel at the negotiation table must be played by President Obama.
During his first term, he never presented his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
After returning to the White House, he continues to show no desire to connect to the solution of this problem.
This is a catastrophically unseen position.
The United States is very interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the unified packaging of cigarettes has come into force.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and the image of the diseases affected parts of the body are contrastly exposed on unclean green boxes, the same for all cigarette brands.
The first in world practice Australian law on single-type packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and color designs of different brands with the same box of untouched olive color with junk images of diseases affected parts of the body and images of children whose health is undermined by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to different images and inscriptions warning of the harm of smoking, the only difference between the packages required from this Saturday is the names of the brands that are printed with the same small font.
These are the hardest conditions in the world for packaging of tobacco products.
The federal government of Australia says that the goal of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving this bad habit of fashion status.
Research found that people who did not smoke before the age of 26, in 99 cases of 100 never become smokers.
“It is clear that even at the very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to bring through packaging,” the health minister Tanya Plibersek explains, referring to studies that showed that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest share of smokers in the world, so these changes will not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but the possibility of taking such measures is already being considered by other countries.
The tobacco industry has strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market on which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those thought by its initiators,” says Scott McKintyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such goods for sale in the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, new laws contribute to the growth of the business.
Sandra Ha from a small family company, Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for portsigarettes and silicone bottles that hide unpleasant images on the packaging has grown rapidly (practically from zero) since two months ago companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the High Court of Australia where they tried to appeal this law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already delivered about six thousand products to wholesale enterprises and awaits a new party.
It is a good business for us.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the population to which these measures are targeted.
After a number of laws adopted in Australia that made illegal television advertising tobacco and support them sports events, as well as prohibiting sellers from exhibiting cigarettes in a visible place, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from placing advertising on the net, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
“If you trade tobacco products and you have only this small shell, the idea of promoting your product on the internet will seem to be extremely attractive to you,” explains Beki Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews on trademarks written by the person of alleged ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises: is it really a matter of the hands of a regular citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he has not regretted his strength and time and made a video, or is it a advertising company behind it?
The Australian department of British American Tobacco says that the industry is now more busy adapting to new rules than advertising.
The representatives of the tobacco industry have even taken such measures as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states make claims within the World Trade Organization, declaring that trade has been subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that the trade relations of all of these countries with Australia are very small.
The WTO decision is expected by the middle of 2013.
According to Tani Plibersek, the government has discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory posting of photographs warning of smoking harm.
Now this rule is adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of strengthening laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia demonstratively do not obey the innovations.
These pictures don’t bother me.
I just don’t pay attention.
“You simply catch a cigarette and hide a pack in the pocket,” explains Victor El Hague, who purchases cigarettes with a picture of a tumor of the mouth on the pack.
To be honest, the only thing that can force me to leave is my little daughter.
James Yu, head of the King of the Pack tobacco store in the center of Sydney, claims that the same packaging complicated the task of placing goods on the roofs.
"Then I had an hour to discharge the new party, and now four hours," he complained.
“The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say, what to do, okay, everything is over, we close the store,” he says, throwing his hands up.
To get bored in the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
At this Thanksgiving Day I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical disorders and was replaced by another plane that we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of tiredness.
I will not cheat you.
A week at the airport waiting for the flight is really boring, and there will not be a lot of help for books, magazines, iPhones, or even free trade stores.
However, in recent years, more and more scientists and children’s development specialists are expressing their favour of boredness.
They say that in certain situations it is not so bad for us and our children to miss.
This forces the brain to discourage on interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the advantages of boredom pass through us.
Maybe we need to try to get bored?
Yes .
At the same time no.
We will go back to that.
Previously, I, like many, thought that boring is an invention relative to recent times when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the Calgary University of Canada, the author of the book "The fascinating story of boredom" (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
“In fact, tiredness can be proud of a very ancient history,” he says.
On the walls of the Pompeii are found Latin inscriptions of boredom dated the first century.
The question remains open about how we understand boredness.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an adjunct professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boring has often changed.
By studying the research material on this topic and asking a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastud and his colleagues came to the following definition: boring is when people “will but can’t do what would make them satisfied.”
The difference between tiredness and apathy, he says, is that a missing person does not do something he would like to do.
I don’t want to do anything with apathy.
The main thing in experiencing tiredness, he says, is “the disturbance of attention and associated with it the deterioration of mood and the feeling that time goes slowly.”
According to the description, tiredness may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood claims that despite the possible connection between these conditions, missing people see the causes of problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people who experience depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel we’re boring when it’s hard for us to focus on something.
In his study “Unemployed Mind: Definition of Fatigue from the Point of Attention,” published in the September edition of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastud and colleagues refer to a previous experiment, the participants of which listened to the record of the voice reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard noise noise noise noise noise noise noise noise noise noise noise noise noise noise noise noise noise noise noise noise.
The participants who listened to a low-speed TV noted that they were boring, more often others - they were difficult to concentrate, but they didn't know the reasons and attributed it to boring.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, breaking attention can cause tiredness, says Mark J. Fensky, an adjunct professor of neurology at the University of Guelfa, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, “for example, looking into the flow of products on the carrier in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boring.”
It is believed that he continues that when people start climbing on a chair or drawing carcass on a paper sheet, they do it from tiredness, but now we know that in fact such actions simply help not relax physically.
“The study has shown that children who are not forbidden to rush and turn, learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit humbly,” says Professor Fensky.
At some point we all get bored: when the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people demonstrate a different degree of tendency to bored.
In the 1980s, for the measurement of such individual characteristics, the researchers developed a special "school of tendance to boredom."
To determine this scale, questions and statements are used, for example, "Many of what I have to do is uniform and monotonous" or "I'm too much interesting, so nothing lacks time."
With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers have determined that boys miss girls more often, says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially in the presence of various external irritants.
However, adolescents generally often miss.
In 1991, Ridd Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he connected with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32% of teenagers said they’re tired at school and during homework, and 23% said they’re tired outside school.
Only 3% of parents said they’re tired.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data about what such data of boring would be now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “the peak of tendance to tired is at the adolescent age,” mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to decide exactly what to do with them.
Let’s go back to my initial question: is boring useful?
Sometimes it’s not because in extreme manifestations it, as research shows, can push people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of tiredness.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the link between tiredness and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been devoted to the study of this problem for more than two decades.
“This is how our brain tells us that we should do something else; it’s boring,” says Gary Markus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
However, this brain itself does not always know what is better to do.
If you’re tired and you’re making this energy for a game of guitar or culinary experiences, you’ll make yourself better.
However, if you start watching TV, you’ll be better for a while, and it’s going to pass soon.
Therefore, if your child is tired and you give him an iPad, he will stop tired, but he will not learn to fight tired by himself or any other way to manage his time and employment, says Professor Fensky.
"And such independent regulation skills are involved in a variety of situations," he says.
Your child learns not only to do something on his own, he also learns self-control at all.
I don’t think it should be bored in any way.
However, it is also not worth considering it something bad.
Instead, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the constant flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with this.
“We see that we need to feel tired more often, while tired is an extremely unpleasant, unbearable desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
In fact, people try to somehow disconnect from constant concerns and just relax.
“In the modern world, we are accustomed to the constant excessive stimulation of the sensory organs,” he says, “and when the silence comes, we lose ourselves and we don’t know what to do.”
It is unclear how the new law on marijuana legalization will apply in Colorado.
Anthony Orosco, a nineteenth-year-old football team player and a student of a public college in the southeast of Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offence that will soon be completely legal throughout the state: storing a small portion of marijuana and the tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco says that one day in September he was with his friends in Lamar and was driving in a prey car near the border with Kansas when they were arrested by the police.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco was sentenced to court for the storage of drugs and the possession of the device for the use of drugs - small crimes, for each of which a penalty of $100 is attributed - and the date of the trial is appointed.
“We are treated like criminals,” says Mr. Orosco.
Is he a criminal?
As a result of uncertainty, which lasts a few weeks after Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana in small amounts for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small trials depends not so much on the law, but on the place of judgment.
Accusations of small crimes related to marijuana are already being removed in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which has taken the same measure.
Police departments have already ceased to raise charges against people aged 21 and older for storing small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law enters into force in a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colorado, the prosecutors have decided to consider existing cases related to marijuana, and are still liable for the storage of this drug.
At the same time, in some cities, from the Denver suburbs to the mountainous regions of the West, votes to prevent the appearance of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their places.
“It’s all developing so fast that I don’t even know what to wait,” says Daniel J. Outs, police chief in the town of Aurora east of Denver.
Representatives of the supervisory bodies in the state of Washington also confusedly throw their heads.
They will have to form rules to determine the procedure for licensing for marijuana cultivation, processing, distribution and sale, and all this must be done before 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, either good or bad, is ahead of most other states in settling marijuana use issues, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“Colorado has a more organized market, so they will serve as a good example,” explained Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Board for the regulation of the production and sale of alcohol in Washington.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith, than make some proposals and hope that it will work.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we could focus on,” he says.
The Washington State bill, named I-502, will enter into force on December 6 and for a whole year will put the state into uncertainty when the state licensing system is not yet available and the right to possess marijuana is already legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be resolved during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state order on "adquate access" to the licensed marijuana with a ban to trade it at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be difficult to place licensed marijuana trade enterprises in the line of cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the recently established research group “Center for the Legalization of Marijuana”.
On November 21, the police chief Outs from Aurora sent an email to his subordinate that the city’s prosecutor’s office will no longer attract people who have reached the age of 21 to the responsibility for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police will stop tracking people in these violations “from this moment”.
Police chief Outs said that the police will monitor compliance in the city with the rules regulating the activities of people growing marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue illegal traffickers and drug distributors.
The Prosecutor of the Ulled County in northern Colorado, Ken Bak, presents a more strict approach to this issue.
After voting on the bill, he said that the prosecutor's office will continue to take responsibility for the possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage consumers to go through the course of treatment.
At present, 119 persons are charged with storing two or less unces of marijuana, although many of them are also charged with other violations.
“The obligation of our institution is to pursue actions that are considered criminal at the time they are committed,” Mr. Bak said in a statement.
The reaction was unnecessary even in places such as the Messa rural district, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The Grand Jankshn, the largest city in the county, is no longer attracting adults to the responsibility for possession of a small amount of drugs.
District Prosecutor Pete Huatsinger supported this decision, but also decided not to remove accusations in already open cases related to the storage of marijuana.
“I believe that ensuring compliance with the law until it changes is our direct duty,” he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of the inhabitants of Colorado who participated in the vote supported this decision, incorporating matters of marijuana for entertainment into the state and legal system will not be easy.
And the controversial reaction of the inhabitants in the various places of the state blurred the inequality of the local authorities’ relationship to the state’s marijuana experiment.
“The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this matter,” explains Sean McCallister, a Denver lawyer representing the interests of those convicted of storing marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reformation of the Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve been persecuting people for so long that they can’t truly deal with that it’s no longer a crime,” he says.
Colorado and Washington - the first states in which small amounts of marijuana are treated as much as alcohol - are intended to become an experimental field on the scale of the country to verify the idea of drug legalization itself.
Legalization defenders and state officials are planning to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are waiting for instructions from the federal authorities, which are still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
The advocates of marijuana legalization hope that the Justice Administration will take action on this issue.
Despite a number of wide-resonance arrests of merchants and patients who consumed marijuana for medical evidence, the federal government in most cases gave good to marijuana trade for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The drug agencies are unlikely to get into their homes to confiscate a small pack of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to the state authorities regulated recreational marijuana stores that are permitted by the new law, says Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug counselor in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado have not been waiting for the action of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local governments approved a moratorium to open new marijuana stores, which would not be able to open earlier than a year later.
Last week, Montrouse, a city in the western part of the state, issued a six-month ban on marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in such a situation that we’ll issue a license to someone and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level,” says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
The city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved questions.
Petronella White: I survived from Oxford because I was a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views began not today.
As much as I remember, I always dreamed of getting to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of an ancient symposium, laying down two foundations of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of study at the Historical Faculty of the Wuster College of the Oxford University at the end of the 1980s, I gathered my bags and went away, which flooded into the first real scandal in my life.
My father did not stand and was crying.
The friends were broken out.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I was leaving college because I didn’t like my fellow students having sex in the neighboring room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson laughed that I was leaving because I had to drink from the sherbed cups.
In fact, it wasn’t so fun.
I escaped.
Yes, I escaped because I was systematically treated and intimidated.
Not because of my quite unusual name or what I studied in a private school.
I was treated for only one reason, and in this glorious curvature of enlightenment it looked like a true barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now dead Woodrow White, was a famous adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the conservatives.
You wonder why to remember this now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students, adhering to right-centric views, is exposed to the same grass.
This institutionalized and increasing hatred towards the Conservative Students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that is provided to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the College College’s Corpus Christi’s club in Cambridge say they are “often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and made themselves feel unwanted guests” because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the College's Committee on Equal Rights to ensure freedom of expression of their opinion.
Their situation was only worsened by the recently released on BBC 2 documentary about the politics in the student environment "The Land of Miracles: Young, Smart and Right", in which conservatives were presented by excentrics and neonazists.
The film shows Joe Cook, the former president of the Association of Conservatives at Oxford University, who rides in the Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver costume and a silver shirt.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they’re making them “cats of vacation because of increased fees.”
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Association of Conservatives at the University of Nottingham, in an interview with one Sunday newspaper said that “the university environment increases the gap towards the left views.
People who don’t even know us, in advance, consider us naked and unpunishedly violent children of wealthy parents.”
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, a student of the History Faculty of the College of Corpus Christi, in which a request for strengthening protection was submitted, calls such an atmosphere "uncomfortable" and Stephen Cheryl, 19 years old, the new president of the Association of Conservatives of the Oxford University, says that the attitude of members of the student club to those who have right-centric views has deteriorated significantly.
“This is a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply to the normal life of the club members,” she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford I was not just in a minority, I was alone.
I arrived there in September 1986, a slave and shy 18-year-old girl.
Oxford was a rainbow of hatred to the conservative party.
A year earlier, the university voted with the ex-student Margaret Thatcher's honorary degree due to a reduction in budgetary contributions to higher education.
In such an atmosphere it would be uncomfortable even for the Stalinists.
In the first days of the first-school week, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, I first felt what was waiting for me.
I didn’t know that teachers didn’t just look through their fingers to the trail of conservative students, but they were also pleased to take part in it.
Political issues – the miners’ strike, the privatization and the government’s disagreement to impose sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa – penetrated through the walls of audiences covered with wooden panels.
At my first seminar I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
“Miss White,” said the teacher, now dead Harry Pitt, “please translate the first paragraph.”
The text was hard for me, and I was overwhelmed.
Harry Pitt was a very yellow man with a face like a cake.
“Tatcherists do not learn French in principle or they just lack their brains?” he asked.
The other students defiled.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take a few initial lessons of French in your free time, if you are not very busy turning in society," Pitt said.
I returned to my room completely unhappy.
That evening at college I was sitting for lunch alone; then someone caught me on my shoulder.
It was James, a second-class student from the Faculty of English, who presented himself as a member of the University Conservatives Association.
“I know who you are,” he said friendly.
Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Everyone who is suspected of sympathy to the conservatives will be deceived.
It’s not easy for me, and in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it’s more difficult for you.
The majority of primary-conservative students pretend they are labyrinths.”
Later, in the local pub, I trivially tried to hypocrite.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick failed.
The first student of the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied in Iton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are infected.”
Other students captured his words.
I was broken, dirty.
“How do conservatives do sex? – One of them asked.
They blame each other, isn’t it?”
I felt as if homosexuals had to feel before the abolition of criminal persecution in the 1960s.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or will I have to meet with the one-minded only under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a labyrinth and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years began to look like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher at my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only because he belonged to the conservatives, but also because he was a Tather's foreign policy adviser and one of its speakers.
He almost did not appear at college.
He deceived him for the provinciality, smallness and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he took the post of professor at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said to me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parent’s home in London, trying to find asylum among relatives and unprecedented capital friends.
I told my father I hate Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn’t believe me.
During his studies in the thirty years there were adopted any political views.
“But it’s the best university in the world,” he said complaining.
They are not able to do so, but not in the city of sleeping spiders.
Even my communist friends always behave perfectly.”
His wet eyes shaken.
Do not make quick decisions.
I’m sure it’s just a joke.
You’ll break my heart if you leave the university.”
I was bored with constant trips to London and my emotional defense was weak.
My friend, also a conservative, did not endure the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The next week, during a seminar, when the next teacher of history called me “the enemy of the people” quite seriously, I decided to do the same.
In my soul burned from shame, I admitted that “my parents washed my brains” and called them “old fools.”
The break was not long.
The last hole in the hole of my career in Oxford was judged to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for the publications belonging to Rupert Murdoch.
My door was closed.
I didn’t get out, and five minutes later my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I picked up my bag and sat on the first train to London.
I have never returned.
You can call me a playoff and a playoff.
But in eighteen years no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the school.
More sadly, it was Oxford, which not only released the fourteen Tory Prime Ministers, but is still hiding behind the unworthy reputation of the university, in which equality and freedom of mind are appreciated.
“Valentino prefers elegance to glory”
About the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Shipping", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Fiona Tisen-Bornemica and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I, is the only place in the British capital, worthy of receiving an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of "Valentino: Master Shitting", a triumphal retrospective exhibition that combines more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is a final part of the story, the only character of which is "El Sinoire" Garavan, but it could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino always felt charmed by the rare and distant world of knowledge.
The first hall of the exhibition, open until March 3, is filled with personal letters and photographs of the signature of the most prominent aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-Han to Lord Snowden, including Mary-Shantal, the Princess of Greece, and Margaret, the Princess of Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophy of his social rise: from the modest gateway from the city of Vogera in northern Italy to the summit of the international "elite".
Being in love with the royal court is nothing bad.
“They at least don’t throw their cigarettes out of your magnificent cover, as some beautiful pop stars do,” says Fiona Tyssen-Bornemica’s baroness.
In the 1960s and 1970s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unpleasant host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
“We all really liked to come in his joke in Gstaad,” explains Hayney’s former wife Tyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Anelli or Eugenia Niarhos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of glory.
Despite this, he is a star.
Valeria Matsha, the representative of Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Matsha remembers a charismatic model.
Once we went to dinner with him home, it was after showing fashion on the Spanish Square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, the younger.
Valentine's style appeared in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in her decoration, in food, in music.
“Every one of the guests Valentino gave it to feel important and loved,” – reminds the top-model, whose work with the designer began in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
“He’s never out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art,” she concludes.
Parade of Parade
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, but of love with complete mutuality.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Summerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous podium of sixties meters in length that offers a role change: the visitor occupies the place of models and has to defile on the podium, looking at the "visitors" from the gres that swallow the mastery of Valentine, such as the dress that was chosen by Jacqueline Kennedy for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that was used by Monica Witty in the "Nights", or the shirt of hair and skin that belonged to Emperor Pharaoh Dyb.
In this audience from the models shine such names as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg.
Nati Abaskal and model, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine - as the first love, "can't forget."
I remember him beautifully.
These were pants, shirts, "gillets" and jackets from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
“This was the gift he made to me,” says Nati Abascal, one of the muse designers.
“I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty,” the former Duchess of Feria added.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they “approx” to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion legislator Patricia della Joompaola d'Arenberg can also not forget the first time she dressed in Valentine.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed I would have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
The hour finally arrived at the end of the 90s.
I bought my first dress from Valentine to wear it for a holiday in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lynn.
It was a red dress, with a jacket with clothes, a "corsage" in a shell and a cut without bretels.
“This was a dream that turned out,” says the widow of Rodrigo d’Arenberg.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is untemporary,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday dress from the designer with "maximum caution... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that accompany it."
The King of Fashion
The Great Finale of the Exhibition in Somerset House - Mari-Shantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "children" (as the designer calls his swieves) to make this order from a shell of the elephant's color with an incrustation of a shell, twelve types of different circles and a shell of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzie Menquez, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress represents the high-end fashion of the end of the 20th century, "the return of customers from the higher world."
Overwhelmed for many years by the "life style" of the elite, now Valentino himself is its best representative.
The Cavalier of the Great Cross (mark of the highest ranking in Italy), the Cavalier of Labour, Commander of the Order of Arts and Words, awarded by the Order of the Honorary Legion, Garavani collected as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
“My attention was always attracted by his subtlety, his calmness, his accurate and perfect appearance,” Arenberg reminds.
Last time I saw him a month ago at a festive dinner at the Orse Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
“He was useless, time does not exist for him.”
If the princess says that...
The hardest profession in the world: Miners with Kavaj-Ijena
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by throwing 70 kilograms of silk into the top of the volcano on rough stone trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijiya, one of the 400 miners who earn for life the grape in the Kavah-Ijjen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the serum gas rising from the depths of the Earth is frozen when it is in contact with the air.
Removing huge pieces of grape, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, pulls the baskets on his shoulders and carries them up on a broken stone road.
To the top of the volcano, whose height is 2,386 meters, only 250 meters, however, wealthy carriers take more than 40 minutes to rise by a scalping step, hard to maintain balance and carefully searching the road so that they don’t fall down or fall from the break.
They know that one wrong step can cost them life, as it happened to a tourist from France who collapsed a few years ago from the Cavas-Ijena rocks.
Miners from Kavaj-Ijena earn 5 euro cents for each kilogram of grape they extract
When they get up, they put their way between the tourists who photograph them, as if they were circus monkeys and, tired of weighing heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the weights that the mining company placed a little above, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
It’s about PT Kandy Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has exploited this volcano since 1960 and, better not to say, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of silk.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemical productions, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make spikes, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamites and even to whiten sugar.
"As the norm is to carry 70 pounds, we make about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each walk," Anto explains, who usually performs three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and eventually feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems poor for such an unhuman effort, it is three times more than it would earn in the field.
“The pay for the miners is very high by local measures, where for the collection of coffee they pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly wage is equal to two million rupees (167 euros),” the carrier, who previously worked as a stonework on the tourist island of Bali, explains.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the area wasn’t so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a heavy reason that in Indonesia is as devastating as the gray: “I married a girl with Bali, where some Hinduists, and brought her to Java to accept Islam.”
He has asthma, he breathes hard, he has a constant cough, and his eyes fall down due to toxic gases.
At his 27 years of age, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kavas-Ijena, whose grain has already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes hard, he has a constant cough, and his eyes are swallowed because of the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
“I’m working for another two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a servant or a port in the hotel, but instead he performs the work of a mole.
Sharing the dirty wooden hill with other carriers, it rises every day at two hours of the night because the gray does not cease to flow over the night when its characteristic yellow color turns into blue and glowes in the dark.
Browsing the challenge to the shadows, Anto descends into a crater, illuminating himself the way with a small lamp attached to his casque, which he himself bought for his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers tasting a gray basket on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano.
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not mechanized the grape mining to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own and with such liabilities.
In fact, they don’t even receive a portion of 30,000 rupees (2,5 euros) of the collection for a photo, which, along with the entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros), the guards of this reserve charge from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people-mulls.
“This is a job for the livestock, not for humans,” says Badrusin, a 42-year-old corner who has spent three decades on the Cave of Eden since leaving college.
Capable to raise up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will suffer work "as much as he can", because he needs money to educate his three children aged 18 to 10 years.
I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano is all my life.
While the grape burns the throat and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the density of the smoke that comes out of the volcano, they are so tolerant that no one complains about their severe diseases... more serious, obviously than their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, knee pain, and wounds on the shoulders that have deformed under the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unaynik can now only raise 50 pounds in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades carry 15 tons of silk from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the warehouse in Tamanzari, overcoming a distance of 18 kilometers on a narrow trail among the rains.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here, because the volcano is all my life,” says Unaynik, opening a wide mouth that lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, the older, 30 years old, also works as a serum carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest occupations in the world: what the human mules do with Kavah-Ijena.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans accuse the career, stress and prices of housing and education in the absence of children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am the husband of a patriot, you are my wife of a patriot, we will fulfill our civil duty and create life!
It may seem unbelievable that these lines are part of the advertising of the mite sheets, but despite this – or because of this – this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore in the beginning of this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local proverbs such as "Let's put a bao in a oven" to laugh over the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, is hoping that with the help of advertising they will be able to attract attention to this problem in a entertaining form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music so that people could fulfill their “national duty.”
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world by reproducing ourselves, so we felt that this was the topic we should touch.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, such as launching spirits with feromons or organizing fast dating parties (blitz witnesses).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but have not necessarily worked.
So we thought why we’t do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely to make a rap?
1.2 Children
Whoever does not perceive it so easily, it is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on a policy to encourage citizens to give birth to more children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends pregnancy and birth holidays and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservation of leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population management, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 – known as the replacement percentage – was in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, the Director of the Division of Married Couples and Families Policy of the National Population Administration, says that the reason for this is “a better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“This allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and family building,” she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the increase in the number of colds and the delay of marriages and childbirth, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, the immigration policy, which is aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to counter the decrease of the population, is causing anger among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where a hardly hidden xenophobia is flourishing towards many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for low wages and unwilling to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also considered as one of the reasons that last year the ruling party of Singapore received the worst outcome in the elections since the time of independence.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rate has some impact on the country’s economic growth, tax revenues, medical expenses and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also begins to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, this starts to affect the real estate sector.
The city development guidelines have passed to the control of the number of small apartments known as a shoe box that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments of 46 square meters are very well sold.
However, there is the opinion that they can promote a cool way of life and deprive the stimulation of builders who want to build a large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, the chief executive of the home-building company EL Developers, says that their shoe boxes are sold much faster than more spacious copies.
They are more popular in the sense that such apartments are purchased for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our income is increasing.
Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new standards give clearer guidelines for builders who have previously placed prey if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules can be a step towards increasing national birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems that they won’t have a special effect.
“People are very stressed, housing is expensive, as well as education, and that’s why many people delay it,” the young manager says.
Others may have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” another 20-year-old man says.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and prices for housing and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, in terms of childbirth, the last word remains behind the Singaporeans.
Personal on the offline - Personal on the online
and confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish Language, it is a property of private or “a sphere of personal life that they have the right to protect from any interference.”
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers that he is exposed when discussing on the Internet situations that he’t share outside the Internet?
ElPeriódico took an interview with five children aged 10 to 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine" in a personal level, and "password and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"My greatest secrets I't upload into the post," says the ten-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the importance of a person on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mom may know them, but not the whole world,” he says.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from the games.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
"I't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who behaves stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it’s bad to publish unpleasant photos of naked people, crimes or write offensive or angry comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 of his friends on FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is aware, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I’m just charging them,” he added.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk with distant relatives or with my friends faster,” he says.
Without thinking, he responds that he would never accept the request from a stranger.
I would not be able to count on someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teen has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter acknowledges that he does not know 20 people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, music, for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one trusted him and did not ask him for his home address or phone number.
“If they get pressed or demanded on me, I’ll just remove them from my account,” he acknowledges.
Jose became a followers of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not strange to the experience of what is known today as cybermobbing.
A friend of my friend was chanted on the social network.
He was threatened and kidnapped.
“He never knew who it was,” he confirmed.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
“I just included confidentiality.”
Then it explains the sequence of steps to set your account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confused situations.
Yes, I would do it if someone doesn’t like me or if I want it.
“While I know it’s cybermobbing,” he confirms.
Key Questions
Marylos Poras, a teacher of English and an educational and educational specialist, believes that to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“Internet appeared as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites the rules of the game have changed,” she notes.
Porras points out that the academic Mark Prensky, a master of pedagogics from Yale University and the author of the work Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines are those, children and young people who were born in the era of technology.
“We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we still learn ourselves,” she says.
It explains that this topic is complex, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be spread, published or spoken, at an age when maturity is not enough for it."
"So that they should be electoral, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show what confidentiality is to children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
“To tell them not to do it is useless,” she adds.
Then Poras lists some options: there are things you’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like to be posted a photo of you like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you sign photos from a party, do you ask permission from others to celebrate them?
And another thing, do everyone need to know what you are doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them understand that they should behave online as they do it off-line.
The rules are the same.
“Outside the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, the same should be on social networks,” she says.
vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary education professor and educational consultant, explains the need for family leaders to read social media policies in good faith.
Understanding each of the points, they have good reasons to talk with children about the conditions of opening an online account.
“For example, the age and what is permitted to spread or publish,” he says.
According to Gaudí, the key question is to remind children of the lesson "Do not talk to strangers".
UNASUR summit ends without the announcement of the LIM Declaration
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lim Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to get access to the document signed at the UNASUR’s sixth round meeting of heads of states and governments, but sources from the Office and the President’s Administration indicated on the main page that it will be transferred after closure, but then confirmed that at a certain time it will be published on the Peruvian government’s website.
On questions about the text, they pointed out that the content was exposed by the President of Peru, Ollianta Umala, during short statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information on the Summit was always limited.
During the day only was broadcast, in the press room, a video of the presidential assembly without a sound with the message "Closed session, the sound is prohibited".
Few information that circulated among reporters was transmitted by the press secretaries of some UNASUR governments who were present at the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document spread throughout the day was the list of the presidents involved, which caused the dissatisfaction of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the administration of the President of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it is about the statement of Umala, not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and that time, despite the press’ persistent demands, the so-called Lime Declaration, which was previously announced, was also not spread.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure the transmission system for all journalists, but restricted the receipt of information as much as possible.
The summit also ended with a joint decision of Chile and Peru to adopt a ruling of the Hague Court, which will resolve the territorial dispute between the two countries.
Peru’s presidents, Ollianta Umala, and Chile’s president, Sebastian Pinera, gathered at a regional meeting and ratified that they will comply with the International Court’s decision, which begins on Monday in Hague the hearing of the statements of both sides, as part of the charges that Lima raised against Santiago.
“We will observe and execute a decision that will clarify the disagreements that we are presenting to this international court,” said Umala, along with his Chilean colleague.
“Chili was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, pact and international tribunals,” Piner added, and welcomed the hands of Umala on the background of the flags of these two countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they will be subject to the International Court of Justice came immediately after Colombia contested this week the Bogotá Pact, according to which it recognized that it was subject to the rulings of this International Court after the decision on the sea border with Nicaragua, which it considered incorrect.
The summit took place in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirschner.
Paraguay, whose membership was suspended since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The adoptive president, Oljanta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, just after midday in Limean time.
The head of state read the final document, in which it said that 16 agreements were adopted and actions were approved on 31 projects among South American countries, the amount of expected investments amounted to $17 billion.
Among the agreements he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we extend the settlement agreements."
He said that actions are being taken to improve cooperation in the fight against citizens’ uncertainty and organized transnational crime, actions to increase the availability of drugs, cheap internet access in all corners of South America and taking into account the risks of natural disasters in a comprehensive and effective way.
Since Europe is in crisis, “the economic unity (Latin America) should not have a triumphant foundation, but should serve to expand our production foundation and predict a better future for our cities,” Umala added.
“We decided to give privileges to a group of 31 mark projects that will improve the connections of the areas of South America, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes,” the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among these projects he mentioned that five belong to Peru, and are limited by cross-country axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its re-adhesion to the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united, and to have good relations between its neighbors, was another topic to be emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting to participate in the regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to conduct negotiations in respectful form on the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the international court disputed by Bogotá.
“Later tomorrow (Saturday), I may meet with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We will review all of these routes, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaragua Pact will require discussions with Nicaragua,” he said.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are provided for a presence at the entry into the post of the new president of the country, Enrique Penia Nieto.
Also within the framework of the summit, the bloc’s defense ministers met in advance to approve the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimously on the issue of the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the participation of the latter has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional block.
“South America must learn from Europe about citizenship integration,” Rafael Correa said.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is the goal in which "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told Peru’s state television that the Europeans “morded each other during World War II” and in other confrontations, “but now they are practically one homeland.”
He defended, in this context, the project of establishing South American citizenship, which is approved by the UNASUR member countries.
“It is necessary to the free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as it is already happening with members of the And community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador also showed himself a supporter of the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the prerequisite of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San Jose Pact on Human Rights.
Those who read lectures never take on any obligations, and we, South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is unclear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and is funded by the United States,” he said, calling for a political asylum given by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that at his time "there were certain suspicions that Assange will be extradited to a third country and the process will not be followed."
He also criticized the Swedish justice for the request to arrive on his territory for the investigation of the alleged sexual crime, while “only Swedish legislation believes it is possible to be performed through a video conference that could be made from the Embassy of Ecuador in London.”
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of Assange's physical and mental health.
"I haven't talked to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small pain problem, nothing serious," he said.
What really is, so it is the danger of deteriorating its physical and mental health due to confinement in a small space without the possibility of doing exercises in the air.
“This affects the health of any person,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the issue of asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuador Embassy in London by providing a security guarantee that will allow him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities, and stressed that there were talks in London to find a solution to the issue of the arrest of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, this word we do not use in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this issue is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European courts,” he said.
And he said that "if the UK gives a guarantee of privacy tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as well as its legislation allows it and as it has already done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogates him via Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to demonstrate himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and stressed that he did not tolerate “mediate, unfairness and lies that distort freedom of expression.”
“The main enemies of the freedom of the press are not the corrupt politicians, but the bad journalists who support surrender, harassment and harassment,” he said.
In this regard, he remained pleased that neither these journalists, neither the banks nor the bourgeois hegemonian countries dominate in Ecuador, and added that, being re-elected, he would “extinguish the revolution to continue the development in the right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to retain Paraguay’s veto to UNASUR at least before the next elections, arguing that the organization “must be solid and not tolerate opportunism and supporting coupes under the mask of legality” because in fact “it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay’s democracy.”
The President of Ecuador said, in addition, that the desire of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries was "fullly justified" after the decision of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which was in favour of the Nicaragua maritime sovereignty.
This decision is not being observed at the moment.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
You need to treat them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion of the maritime border dispute, which is conducted at the same court in Peru and Chile, and said that "It is right for Latin America to appeal to international courts if two countries are committed to making a decision, no matter how difficult it is."
In view of the possibility to appear as a candidate in the coming presidential elections in Ecuador to vote for the third consecutive period, he said he is considering this opportunity “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it’s quite difficult.”
Correa assured that if he loses the elections in February 2013, he will leave the public life.
Personally, I’ve never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
“My political movement thought that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I must acknowledge that responsibility,” he said.
In the event of victory, this would be my last term in the presidency, and then we will leave the public life.
If we lose, the same.
“This is a decision,” he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro who told me that he was going to a treatment that was already planned, routine, and that he is expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean an aggravation of President Chávez’s health,” he explained.
The head of the state of Ecuador took part today in Lima in the VI summit of the heads of states and governments of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
Death from AIDS today - the result of late diagnosis
Fabricio was 21 years old when he was announced that his AIDS analysis gave a positive result.
“I’m as if I’d been fooled,” he remembers that difficult, despite all the doctor’s touch, moment.
The boy hid this from his family.
Deciding to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And his efforts were justified - he already noted his 43th birthday.
Fabricio is one of the oldest HIV patients at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he got in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He has been diagnosed with the "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) for 22 years. At the beginning of the 90s it would be difficult to believe - there were too few treatment options, too few knew about the disease, too predicted treated the patients.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection didn’t want to say goodbye to him, “because he had a cut.”
In other words, having AIDS at the time was a sentence.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do so without deteriorating the quality of life.
Nevertheless, without knowing about their disease, many people still come when the virus has already damaged, "exhausted" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first cases, “a great achievement at this point is that the survival of the patient who starts treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same,” said Hime Andrade Vilyanova, head of the HIV department of HCG, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific edition.
Infectionist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have come to the conclusion that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depends on the degree of damage to the immune system in patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with the best expected duration of life in those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 is.
Simply speaking, the above means that the person who is diagnosed with HIV-positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, “supporting control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years,” he explained.
To evaluate this progress, it should be remembered that the length of life of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the annual UNEIDS report), it is also true that since the occurrence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
Only in Khalisco 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have been recorded by May of this year; however, it is claimed that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
Why are there deadly outcomes?
I personally think the problem is not in access to treatment.
I think this is the case in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a deficiency in medications, the problem is that patients come very late because they don’t know about their infected state, i.e. in the late stages of the disease.
He brought devastating data: “Nine out of ten patients come when they already have any opportunistic infection; what should be done to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, so it is to make a diagnosis at a earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for mass detection, for all the people who will ask for it.”
In his proposal, experts and officials of the State AIDS prevention council in Halisco (COESIDA) agree, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabricio, who went to a private laboratory for checking, motivated only by the fact that his friend did it and, despite his young age, he was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from the sarcoma of Caposhi, a cancer tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die and they don’t want to know anything.
“When I’m going to die anyway, it’s better that I’m going to swallow three times a week,” they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, exercise, take medications.
Nowadays, his parents only know that he was suffering from cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of jobs, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and the other person," said Fabricio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to promote his statement to those who now, in the context of the World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This report summarizes the topic of fighting AIDS this year.
Preservatives for the stick
The big gap between health programs and the ordinary citizen, believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who dealt with the HIV-related problem.
The most important is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "it has actually increased the spread of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packs for a hundred, and that's very good, but it turns out that there are those who now still have no access to the condoms," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
“Why are they you?” is a popular question, with evilness and condemnation, by social workers, school consultants, pharmaceutical workers and health workers who don’t want to hear teenagers.
I propose to change this ineffective distribution; that the preservatives are not only behind the stickers and that hundreds of them are in automates in public toilets in places that young people frequently visit.
This is not an incentive to dissolution.
It’s not about paying for beer and motel, Governor Emilio González replied when asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his leadership.
“This is not sexuality, it’s best to make preservatives available to those who are already practicing sexual activity,” he said.
Key data in Halisco
In total, 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV have been registered).
The state is ranked 4th in the national ranking for new and summary cases of AIDS and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections are related to the sexual path, 6% through the blood and 2% to the perinatal path.
According to estimates, 50,000 people can live with HIV, as for one registered case there are from 4 to 5 people who don’t know about it.
Given the U.S. Court of Appeal’s ratification of a decision that cancells the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the scenario sets a deadline precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in a neighboring country that has solvency problems.
Procedures to support the survival of companies, which are permitted by Mexican laws, appear to be not valid in the country of stripes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In the practical sphere, the approval of the judge Harlin Hale's June 15 ruling in the North Texas District Bankruptcy Court leaves Mexican firms unprotected to face the possibility of imposing arrest on their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the doors to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, bringing into evidence three disagreements.
As an entry, while the judge notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings relate to the competition proceedings being discussed in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational profiles.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Typical Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without the inter-corporate vote, recognized in the critical mass of competitive production debts that had before the mother company Vitro affiliates, the majority needed to approve the restructuring would not be achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are thousands of examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-corporate debts are guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Productions.
It is also true that by reading the votes of the subsidiaries, somehow the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the U.S. courts, i.e. the funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37.
This data is submitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States has hit the country.
So far, the family firm Gonzales Sada will appeal the decision to the appeal court itself so that the vote will reach its plenary session, i.e., five judges, given that only three voted.
In the event of failure, a certification application will be submitted, which will require a review of the process by the Supreme Court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The worst is that the court rejected a document sent by the government of Mexico in the role of amicus curiae ("the other court"), which describes the process following by Vitro under the Competition Procedure Act, signaling that it is exempt from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it to Article 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has followed the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Karambol from two boats: they beat in Vitro and beat in the country.
The overall balance
Given the several months delayed complaints placed on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraud management, the Association of Aviation Pilots has already found a bottle throat.
The court, led by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino, has just filed a criminal case against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is accused of hindering justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority systematically refused to provide reports to the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic regarding the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund F/589 of the IXE bank 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The resources would be aimed at the purchase of shares of the Professional hotel management company.
As you know, Ascaraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
Around the Dragon Mart
Meeting in the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of local and foreign ecologists, scientists, businessmen and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front to confront the discovery of Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about a giant centre of sales and distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean countries of products of an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for employees of 150 companies.
Earlier, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the monumental forces that raised some of the protected territories from the ground and pose serious threats to the industry.
Death of ACTA
As the government rejected the request of the Senate to explain, under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Commercial Agreement against counterfeiting, known as an abbreviation in English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, this case has already passed into the archive.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility to consider it as a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector Hetin Reyes: “Basketball was my life”
The busy basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico keep in memory as many basketball stories as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And before a stroke attracted him to a disabled wheel in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, as a small-category player, player of the Higher Basketball League, authorized and head of the BSN with the Cowboys of Bayamon and the President of the Basketball Federation.
“I’ve played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including a few at the same time as when I was BSN President, National Team Director and Federation President in the 1990s,” Reyes reminds during his visit to Primera Hora home in Bayonne, where he lives with his faithful wife Isabelle for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Rayes does not exaggerate by making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorials collected during his long journey, testify to this.
Bayonne in the Heart
With the greatest emotions he keeps those who remember his way through Kovboyev, starting from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when it was the 15th anniversary of his performance as a co-agent or contract agent.
“It’s been my best years that I’ve the most because I’ve had the opportunity to be part of the eight Copenhagen Championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or leader.
There were many years of joy, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Minsy's debut in BSN.
“Since that moment and forward to lead was the “Coco” Ortis, who was a great administrator,” Reyes said.
I remember that Jean Bartov, who went here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a very strong player for you, a growth of 6'7."
“You want?”
And that was the beginning of Minsy, one of the best players who had been in Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended the sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember that he said that if Minsy had brought the championship to Bayamone, Gauss would help win another one.
I the Covboev Championship with Gauss, but I was already on a distance, because in 1988 he was already the head of the federation.
To that time, I prefer to enjoy his achievements and achievements in the national team.
I remember how we won the first time in the U.S. during the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got the fourth place and it should have been a bronze if not the Canadian judge who forced us to overplay the final game, Reyes said.
The team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you’ve ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one she won at Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favourite was that from the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the U.S. team, which was quite similar to that we won bronze at the World Cup.
In that team not only again played Minsy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and Piculina (Ortisa), but also young (Havier) 'Tonyito' Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihote' Morales, who failed to participate in the 90s due to knee injury.
The team, which was not the best in terms of personal composition, but brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualification Tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role-players like 'Canito' Neves, Pablo Alisea and the young Roland Hurruitner in exchange for players temporarily removed for disorders in the Pan-American Championship Mar del Plata, we won gold in spite of all the forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without any doubt, it was Piculin Ortis.
His performances at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Piculin did.
And that without considering his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
This is a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melandes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From young, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you think is your main achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s in the BSN was up to 17 teams in the season.
What have you left to do?
There were things I wanted to realize, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, the boys from Pons play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national play-offs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that’s unnecessary.
At least, I see the fruits of mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
This gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
The most I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Icabel, who has always been with me.
The actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became worldly famous for his role as John Ross Ying, more known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil robber Jay Ar Ying in the Dallas TV series became a symbol of thirst in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday evening from complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided for The Associated Press by Warner Bros., Dallas production studio.
“Larry has returned to his favourite hometown, Dallas, again playing the character role he liked the most,” his family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas at a fair in honor of Thanksgiving Day.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was next to Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, her representative, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, fun, loving and talented, and I’ll miss him very much.
“He was an original person and lived a full life,” Grey said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he admitted that he was drinking for many years.
In 1995, he had a malignant tumor in the liver and he was transplanted.
Long before Dallas, Hagman gained popularity on television thanks to the role of a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In her he played Captain Tony Nelson, a astronaut whose life changes when he meets the attractive girl-gin played by Barbara Eden, and begins to live with her under one roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared in the broadcast, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included roles well-accepted by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterpiece interpretation of the amazingly disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the top of glory.
The CBS drama series about the Yingov clan and other characters around it was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who Shoot in J.R.?", designed to create noise around the episode, full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, has raised international discussions and millions of dollars that were risked in bookmakers' offices.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series.
When the response was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned Dallas into the second most viewed entertainment program in history, after the 1983 MASH final, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R., Christine (in the performance of Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. interfered with her and then threatened her to accuse her of prostitution if she didn’t get away from the city, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Yuing as an unsaturated corruptor with a charismatic smile: an unfair entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his spouse, Sue Ellen (Linda Grey), to be placed for treatment.
“I know what should be on the J.R. grave plate,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should be said, “There will be a fair citizen J.R. Yung quiet.”
This is the only deal he has lost.
Victoria Prinsipal, also the heroine of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as someone "gigant, both on and outside the screen."
It is unforgettable and indispensable for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who have been lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new release of Dallas were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season was already completed and the sixth was in production, the channel.
Warner or TNT have not yet announced what will happen to the series after Hagman’s departure.
In Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who glorified in such classic works as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage with her lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried happiness on the theatrical scenes of New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
When he was there, he met the young Swedish artist May Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Haydi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he named his memoires Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't include anything that I thought could cause pain to someone or affect them in any way," he said at the time at Prensa Asociada.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer at the hospital to help patients who were afraid.
“I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to the operation, and then,” he said in 1996.
I’m trying to offer some comfort, like “Don’t be afraid, it’ll be a little uncomfortable in a short time, but you’ll be okay.”
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course that explores “The End of the World”
Each week students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when Professor of Religion Stuart Sharma decided to read the course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an irreflectable trick: the end of the “long reverse count” of the May calendar, December 21, which many people took as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Sharma had no idea what he was expecting in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call “long-harmageddon,” and the growing conflict to which Israel will be pulled, a place where the Christian theoreticians of the end of time believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharma told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If we analyze what is happening in the world right now, as if we had only 30 days left, it was really a good time.
And remember that bad things are good for those who have an apocalyptic image of thought.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the topic "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, the adjunct professor Barry Walker reads the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We are analyzing why these ideas are spreading over time," he said, and the way suggested by hypothetical scenarios that cause certain human actions.
If nuclear materials fall into the hands of the terrorists, for example, a war may break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to examples from real life.
"I tried to tell students what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," Waker said.
At the main campus of the Pennsylvania State University, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art history and anthropology, gathered together to read a course that is simply called "the end of the world".
"We don't add '2012' to always have the opportunity to read the course again if the end of the world doesn't come," Restall said.
Despite the “unavoidable destruction”, students must learn, prepare projects and pass final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be accepted in the Apocalypse Canyon, which does not leave students another choice but to work "up to the same night in which the end of the world is supposed to come," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"The places ended in two hours," Restall said about his course for students with a high average score, for which 35 students were registered.
We received emails for many weeks before the beginning of the semester from people who asked if there were more places.
Students, in turn, confirm that this course is one of the most interesting.
“I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves,” said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic image of thought, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Weeks, a 25-year-old student at the Department of Psychology and Sister Affairs, said he watched all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard of a course that would teach this,” he noticed.
I like him.
But no one of the surveyed students – not to mention the professor – said he believed in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
“Our first project affected the Maya prophecy, and in some way we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last course at Temple University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key moment in the calendar.
But he noted that there is apocalyptic anxiety in the Western culture, which counts several centuries, where people react to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
“In other places people don’t think about it,” he said.
Especially in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question whether he knows about any course about the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines does not take part at the end of the world,” he wrote, indicating the order of the higher instance.
We have forgiveness from the Pope.
Restall noted that for a long time it was talked about many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "People will immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosophy that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are unhappy with this date.
Some said they’re going to go to the “End of the World” party.
“Maybe I’ll call someone of my friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student at the Faculty of Communications.
