This confirms the already widely held theory that only some dinosaurs had feathers, and provides details on color and three-dimensional structure that are not usually provided by descriptive fossils.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were brownish-brown on the surface and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
The discovery provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur wings lacked the stalks in their developed form, called rachis, but had other features of feathers - barbs and barbels - researchers speculated that rachis could be a later evolutionary development.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight but for thermal control or display. Although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers suggest that the specimen shows a mature wing, not a tail.
Although this is a small dinosaur tail, the results of the sample suggest that it has adult tentacles, and that it is not on the back of a chicken's skull.

He was later transferred to Aytonbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in the custody of the Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then for the murder of her son.
He is pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be tainted by the widespread exposure of his image.
This is common practice in England, but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts consider the publication of the photographs as likely to be biased.
"Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Tandy, said that 'journalists are taking a dangerous path by publishing photos of suspects.' "
The High Authority, which administers the overall responsibility for the cases, indicated to journalists that no further comment would be made, at least until the charges were in place.
According to the leaked confidential message, the document will be about the border dispute over the claim of Palestine to the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered include the future province of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, but the PA agrees to leave only five years of military presence.
Since the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated, the firefighters should closely monitor the shooters in the sub-parasitic control test.
The event was jointly organised by the WWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) and was attended by qualified volunteers from the Sporting Shooters Association's Hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the NWS's alternate director of park conservation and heritage, the four selected shooters have been given full security and training details.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday on the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential panel suggested the resignation of the previous CEB as part of the country's move towards new elections.
The commission is Martelli's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Some sectarian-violent protests were fuelled by the failure to hold elections since 2011.
There were 60 reported complaints of iPods overheating and not working, which in total caused six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has reported 27 accidents involving equipment.
"Last week METI reported that Apple had reported 34 additional heat events, which the company said were 'not serious.'
In response, the ministry said that Apple's postponement of the report was 'really regrettable'.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management of the Northern Marianas said there were no casualties in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former police officer from the Philippines is holding Hong Kong tourists hostage in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, after they were kidnapped from a bus.
Rolando Mendoza used his M16 rifle to shoot tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
The six hostages, children and the elderly, were released first, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of the grandmother who needed a toilet. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical field.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital, Auckland in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital, Liggins began to inquire about premature birth in her spare time.
His research suggests that administering one's hormone can accelerate the development of the fetal lung.
Jinhewa said government officials had found two 'black boxes' from the plane.
Luna was also honoured by his fellow wrestlers.
"Tommy Dreamer said that 'Luna was the first king of the terrorists. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. She was as different as she was. She was a determined woman.'"
"Luna is as bad as I am...maybe even worse"..."I love her and I'm sorry for her loss...I hope she's in a better place than this", Dustin "Goldie" Rennells said.
Of the 1,400 who voted before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Cabinet Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she hoped Australia would become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of voters said that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the peak of the poll, 29 per cent of people believed Australia should soon become a republic, while 31 per cent believed Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in swimming was scheduled to compete in the 100m, 200m and three relay at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her condition, the participation is in question.
He was unable to take the medication needed to relieve his pain because it was banned in the game.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of mathematical sciences at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known until January 25.
The invention was verified by several people using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been Earth's source of water, as well as the organic material to make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope that by studying the long-term collisions of Earth's galaxies, they can understand how planets form, and in particular, Earth.
Cuomo, 53, was sworn in as governor earlier this year and signed a same-sex marriage bill into law last month.
He called the rumours 'meaningless political talk and nonsense.'
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The FAA says that nextGen will enable aircraft to fly on narrow routes and save billions of gallons of fuel and carbon emissions annually.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology to give air traffic controllers more accurate targeting of aircraft and more accurate information to pilots.
No additional traffic is being generated, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the grounds.
Fear of a lack of transportation could force the team to play behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the creation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species have evolved in two generations, although the process was believed to take longer, due to a cross between the species of Tartus pinch, Geospiza fortis, and the species of Emigrates cadus pinch, Geospiza conspecifics.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, even small balls.
It can be pulled into a thin tube, twisted and knitted, and then beaten or rolled into sheets with a hammer.
"It can be made very thin and then laid on top of another metal. Sometimes it can be made thin enough to be used in books with hand-painted pictures, and it's called a 'luminous manuscript.'"
This is called chemical pH. You can use red cabbage extract to make an indicator.
The coconut changes the color of its juice depending on how acidic or alkaline it is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H) ions in the test chemical (pH).
The hydrogen ions are the protons that have lost their electrons (because the hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze it with clean wet hands to catch the roll.
The moisture in your hands reacts with the outer skin layers, giving it a funny feel and creating a kind of top hole.
Almost every house in Harappa and Moganjatharo has a flush toilet connected to a state-of-the-art sewage system.
In Greece, the remains of sewage systems have been found in homes in the cities of Crete and Santorini in Minoan.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes used by men and women together as part of public baths.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call from the Earth and then reflects it back down immediately after the call is received.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope into space, it takes a huge rocket to go 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing that the wheel has given us is that we have much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us the train, the car and many other modes of transport.
Below them, rabbits eat medium-sized food, from horned manes and geese to medium-sized cats.
Finally, many small cats (including domesticated cats) eat many small insects, mice, deer, and birds.
The secret to their success is their sense of self, that each cat has its own special job, not in competition with others.
In lions, social cats live in large groups called Prides.
A lion herd is a group of one to three adult male lions and thirty female lions and their cubs.
Sisters and daughters within a large family are usually closely related to each other as women.
Wolves and dogs, like lions, are incredibly agile animals (but not other cat species) and are adept at even the most dangerous of tasks.
A skilled athlete, the tiger can leap, swim, and cover great distances with a certain amount of speed and can pull an object with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger (genus Panthera) is in the same group as lions, leopards and jaguars. Only these four cats can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's great roar, but like a roar of words with a loud voice.
The azilotes prefer small animals and will try to catch monkeys, snakes, reptiles and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that the azilotes prey on are much smaller than that.
Scientists think that the oscillators mimic animals in the earth by sniffing and catching them and eating them.
The acylotes have excellent night vision and stealthy locomotion, allowing them to blend in with their surroundings and to hunt for prey.
When a small group of people (a small population) are separated from a large group of people (if they move through a mountain or a river or they migrate to a new island where they cannot easily return) they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new crowd will need different features or variations to be stronger competitors than before.
The real population is not going to change, and it needs to be adapted today as it was in the past.
Over time, new populations adapt to different environments, and therefore they appear different from other people.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process we call speciation, the creation of a new species, and speciation is an inevitable result of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat comes from plants, and animals cannot live without plants.
The Mosasaurus was the prime predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
With over 70 razor-sharp teeth in its long jaws, it has an extra set of teeth on the top of its mouth, meaning that if anyone gets in its way, it cannot escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had very sharp teeth, and it may have eaten turtles, large fish, and mosasaurs, and it may have been a carnivore.
It attacked anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex.
The Romans had a share of the most bizarre or unusual dishes, including wild boar, deer, slugs and tormouses.
Another big difference is that the poor people eat their dinner sitting in the chair with the women, but the rich people like to eat the dinner together as if it were a lounge on its side.
The ancient Romans' diet could not have included foods that came to Europe from Asia or the Americas centuries later.
For example, they never ate corn, tomatoes, or coconuts, and no ancient Roman could have ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to all their gods, and they considered it their home.
People bring offerings for the gods. Pandits seek to satisfy the needs of the gods through festivals and ceremonies.
In each temple, there is an outdoor temple madam and an indoor Kavitakram, which is open only to Pandits.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped ziggurats were built as part of temples.
At the top of the tower, there was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home is not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent in the open.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were open to the street.
The wood was very expensive, as there were no large forests in the land of Canaan.
Greenland has had very little settlement. In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder. They say that when he went further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
His discovery showed that the Eskimos already lived there.
Although all countries are 'Scandinavian', Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland have many differences in people, kings, customs and history.
If you've seen the National Treasure film, you might think that there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true, because even though there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
"The back of the Declaration of Independence reads, 'The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.' The text appears in reverse at the bottom of the document".
The first is that the large parchment document (measuring 29 3/4 by 24 1/2 inches) was bound in a shroud to protect it, although no one knows who wrote it.
So, this markup could have been simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the wars that followed liberated the north of France, but the east has not yet been liberated.
"It was ruled by the 'Vichy' French, who made peace with the Germans in the 1940s and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them".
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragon.
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned back toward Germany.
A single culture is a large group of people working and living together as a community.
The word civilization, from the Latin civilis meaning civil and civis meaning citizen and civitas meaning country or province of a country, is sometimes used to define the size of a community.
City-states are the precursors of states. A civilized culture is one that is characterized by the sharing of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and a fair distribution.
Smaller cultures, often disappearing from the relevant historical sources, are missed and not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states - with only Congress - formed a weak central government under the federalist framework.
The Congress party had no power to impose taxes, and, lacking a national administration or judiciary, it was largely dependent on uncooperative government officials to enforce all its laws.
It did not even have the power to control the inter-state tax and customs duty.
The state government took the central government very casually as the amendment of the rules required unanimous approval of all the states before it could be enacted and often their representatives were not there.
The German national football team, along with Italy's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, handball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing.
The Winter Games are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and the Olympics.
Japan has over 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the grouping of Japan's islands, from a geographical point of view, Japan is called an archipelago.
The origins of Taiwan began in the 15th century, where European sailors recorded the name of the island they passed as Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a shift in indigenous grain production methods and using Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which, Japan was given full rights over Taiwan, which Japan ruled until 1945.
The three main structures are the Tituhuwatana, the Sun Temple, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
The edges of the campus have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how most of the buildings were originally.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most commonly used still photograph format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film format during the parallel film era.
It is still produced today, but most importantly its aspect ratio was derived by digital camera image sensor formats.
Actually the 35 mm shape, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high is a bit confusing.
So the aspect ratio of this pattern (the simple integer ratio divided by twelve) is said to be 3:2.
Many common systems (for example ABS-type systems) are equal to or close to this normal ratio.
The rule of thirds, often derided, is a simple guideline for generating energy when a certain amount of order is maintained in a photograph.
The efficient space for the main lesson is the point where the lines that divide a shape into three vertical and three horizontal lines meet (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become both money-rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has built European nations beyond their differences in language and customs.
The power that was involved in all of this affected everyone from the government to the common people.
The idea that money should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty is one of the Christian doctrines, and the financial wealth of the churches is there primarily for this reason.
The central authority of the churches has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of this power and wealth in one place leads many to question whether the basic principles are being fulfilled.
As these protests erupted, Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified in many international treaties of the past two centuries, the strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies.
The British also planted net bombs in international waters to prevent any British vessel from entering certain areas of the sea, endangering neutral shipping.
The tactic was so ineffective that Germany expected the same result for unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing mood of most citizens and nations was one of peace and solitude.
Countries that had witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to give to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own system of government at different times; each family in China at every level or in power was a distinct dynasty.
There was a period of instability between each dynasty, with provinces being divided. The Three Kingdoms period of 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties is best known for this period.
During this period, there was a fierce battle between several nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody period in ancient Chinese history, when thousands of people fought and died to occupy the highest office in the great palace of Xi'an.
The adoption of the metric system, the transition from dictatorship to republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation is not about individuals but about the people have had many social and political consequences.
After the revolution, all professions made it possible for all male applicants to advance, the most ambitious and successful.
This is also true of the military, as it is based on capability rather than rank.
The French Revolution also inspired revolutions among the oppressed working class in other countries.
"Muhammad was deeply involved in matters beyond the world. He frequently went to the cave later called 'Hira' on the 'Nur' (light) to perform penance".
He painted a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations in a cave that has remained timeless.
The cave, located on a (1) hilltop north of Mecca, was completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if one knows it exists, it is not easy to find it. Once inside the cave, it is total isolation.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and surrounded by many mountains. Very little of the world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor the late Pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau or ""Giza Necropolis"" in the Egyptian Valley contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was created to honour Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour Khufu's wives and family members.
"The 'upper arch' was a V and the 'lower arch' was a steeple or a square without a lower part".
If it's up you have to press the arrow starting from the tip, and if it's down you have to pull the arrow starting from the frog (where your hand is holding the arrow).
A lower bow is more powerful and emphatic, while an upper bow is usually less loud.
Feel free to write your own scores, but remember that a worship is for a musical reason, so they are generally to be respected.
The exiled King Louis XVI, the Empress Marie Antoinette, their two younger children, 11-year-old Marie-Th√©r√®se and four-year-old Louis-Charles, and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were driven from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a gang of robbers.
As they returned to Paris in a carriage, a mob surrounded the carriage, shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
(1) At one point a mob member held up the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles to the awe-inspired queen.
The cost of the American imperialist invasion of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime for the bulk of the expenses and the interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street bank.
Of course, the basic benefits of U.S. imperialism may be the profits of the exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand the templars, one must understand the context that inspired the creation of the organization.
The period of events commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages is the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries of the period of European history (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages and Late Post-Medieval periods, which are traditionally considered to have ended around 1500, preceded the High Middle Ages.
Techno-determinism is a term with a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological motivation or technological imperativeness to a rigorous sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their expression in technology.
"The interpretations of the principles of technology follow a path that goes beyond cultural or political impact and expresses the two (2) ideas of the 'effects' of technology on society as natural rather than as caused by social impact".
For example, one might say that motor cars are the necessary means of developing roads.
However, nationwide road connectivity for only a few cars is not economically feasible, so new manufacturing methods are being developed in an attempt to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The fact that the public owns cars also causes a lot of accidents on the road, which makes it easier for the health sector to find new techniques to repair injured bodies.
The greatest element of cultural determination, derived from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schleiche, was in romanticism.
As for romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time those geography-related customs and culture arose, and these were better suited to society than arbitrary laws.
While Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was the middle of the Renaissance, from about 400 A.D. to 1100 A.D.
Its status began to decline in the 12th century, largely because the crusaders returned with more valuable potatoes and spices than the Byzantine markets could provide.
It was at this time that the title of the capital of civilization was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was prevalent between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Early on, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may be lagging behind by 25 to 30 years.
It was not until the late Middle Ages that Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great developments of that period was the use of buttons to sew clothes.
Subsistence farming is the farmer's ability to produce only the amount of food required for himself and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, mostly organic system that uses stored seeds that are native to the environment and can increase yields by combining crop rotation or other simple methods.
Historically most farmers were engaged in agriculture for a living, and this is still the practice in many developing countries.
Subcultures help to bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by society's standards and help them develop an identity of their own.
Sub-cultures may be distinct because of the age, race, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture are those that are distinguished by language, appearance, religion, politics, gender, geography or a mixture of other factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through the use of their distinctive and iconic style of dress, behaviour and speech.
The best way to emphasize the importance of socialization is to rescue children who are exposed to misfortune and humiliation by children or adults, and children who are not exposed to public life.
"Such children are called 'feral' or 'bully'. Some bully children are shunned by people (usually their own parents); in some circumstances, abandonment occurs because of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability or because of parental rejection".
The children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the forest themselves.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the feral child has the full range of behaviour of the domesticated animal, such as fear or indifference to humans (to the extent that physiology allows).
Process learning can make learning easier and more fun. Scaffolding goes one step further.
Scopfold is not a learning method but rather provides support to individuals who are using a new computer to gain new learning experience or start a new project.
Scaffolds can be real and virtual, meaning the editor is a scaffold as well as the little paperclip man in the micro-software office.
Visual scaffolds are designed internally in the software, and should be able to question, trigger, and explain procedures that might be challenging for students to handle on their own.
Children are also left in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, hurtful speech, and extortion.
No child has to grow up in a careless, unproductive, uneducated environment, but they do.
We think that the foster care system is a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system is committed to providing a safe home, loving caregivers, sustainable education and reliable health care.
The foster home is expected to provide all the needs that were lacking in the previous home.
The Internet integrates elements of public and private communication.
Some of the notable features of the Internet are its use and its use of contentment-based approaches to allow for additional dimensions of the Internet.
For example, learning and socialization are the main motivators of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"When Imee and Mykord examined the audience's reactions to the websites, they found both 'individual engagement' and 'continuous relationships' as new activating factors".
The use of video recording led to important discoveries in subtle emotional expression and facial movements that lasted only a few seconds.
In particular, it is said that by correctly interpreting the content of a person's micro-emotions, one can detect whether he is lying.
In The Presidential Speech, Oliver Sacks points out that the sincerity of people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can be accurately measured.
He even suggests that such abilities to mimic human behaviour could be shared by domestic animals like dogs.
Twentieth-century research shows that there are two kinds of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Defects add new mutations and selection removes it from the mutation type.
The distinction between the two generations is blended back and forth by division and rearrangement.
Outside the savannah grasslands, it is difficult for an animal with a digestive system like humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Further, failure can have serious consequences such as developmental depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources are proteins from leaves and grains, but they are difficult for mammals like us to digest without cooking.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, caterpillar, eggs) are easily digestible but contain high-quality protein with all the amino acids they need.
All things considered, it is not surprising that our ancestors would have solved the protein problem, as the chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep disturbance is when you wake up from your normal sleep time for some purpose and go back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done quite easily using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you are going to stop your clock while you sleep, put it on the other side of the room and force yourself to stop it when you wake up.
Other biorhythm-based choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water, tea, and the well-known urine-separation) before bedtime, which prompts us to wake up and urinate.
The degree of inner peace that a person has is related to the degree of tension in one's body and soul.
Every human being who has less autism, more positive life has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
We can all reach enlightenment. The obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negative thoughts.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was extended by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple, and they are based on Kundalini yoga, meditation and love that goes beyond all.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (radiant energy) is activated through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The centre of Tibetan meditation is Deva Yoga. By showing the various deities, energy paths are cleansed, chakras are activated and a sense of enlightenment is created.
The USA and the USSR had a mutual alliance, as Germany was a common enemy in World War II. After the war ended, organizational, operational and cultural differences kept the two nations apart.
Two years after the war ended, former allies now became enemies and the Cold War began.
It continued for the next 40 years, with real, fake forces, on the battlefields of Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already broken down, and the hope was to reconstruct the crossing of the Roman bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight after the Soviet Union entered the Red Army with over 800,000 troops. The Soviet Union created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after it occupied the eastern part of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships is the most efficient way to transport large amounts of people and goods across the sea.
It is the traditional job of the Navy to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while it is their job to impede your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of WWII, in which the Americans attempted to transport men and goods across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boat types, attempted to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies been defeated, Germany might have taken Britain as it had taken the rest of Europe.
The first domesticated sheep appeared in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes had access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
The domesticated sheep were raised in herds that roamed the mountains or grazed the pastures, often led by children or young adults, especially the so-called shepherd, widely known as the shepherd. This form of herding is still practiced today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the carriage tracks had only wooden parallel planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to pull at great speed and to carry more weight than the slightly rougher roads.
In the early days, cross-bars were introduced to hold the tracks, but it was felt that if an iron bar was gradually placed on top of it, the tracks would still have potential.
Although this became the usual practice, it caused a lot of wear on the wooden wheels of the iron carriages.
In time, wooden wheels evolved into iron wheels. In 1767 the first full iron railway was introduced.
The earliest known form of transportation is walking, which humans began doing two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the astralopetics, were not used to walking upright.
Although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago, bipedal specialization is found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago.
We can start to live more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, we can act as activists to reduce some of the future impacts.
It is like symptomatic therapy in many cases, however, if we don't want a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problem and we have to deactivate it.
It is obvious that the world has changed so much because of the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and the problems have increased because of the increasing population and the very extravagant lifestyle of the human race.
After being accepted by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft was signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson and sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
"Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, and they are now called the 'Dunlop Broadsides.'"
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
A man was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read to the troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The extant 25 tonne-foot-wide pages are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs escaped and survived, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of themselves as dinosaurs because they have wings and they can fly.
But there are still many things that look like dinosaurs in birds.
They have legs with fins and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
All computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of the two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal swelling may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of indoor poisoning may be an open container of medication or household chemicals.
Look for the specific label in the first aid recommendation for the specified poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in the formal sense of this group of insects.
The term is related to the older term for caseworms, which have adapted to become parasites on humans.
Both insects and roundworms are cluster dwellers, living in the cluster or in the habitat of their host.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the child's best interests.
These couples are choosing adoption plans for their child.
In adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can be the parent of the child.
The main goal of science is to scientifically discover how the world works, and this system is actually the basis for a great deal of scientific research.
It's not just testing, and testing is a test that is used to dismiss one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make references and guide further scientific testing.
The naturalists and philosophers also focused on the classics, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views are accepted in all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declines, the West feels cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Rhythms in physiology and behavior are largely determined by biological clocks, mainly the presence of endogenous cycles and their production.
Non-normal responses to external stimuli have been documented in a variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to move smoothly in a cyclical pattern even in the absence of external cues.
One of the key suggestions that DNA is genetic material is the Hershey and Chase experiment.
Hershey and Chase used either insects or viruses to insert their DNA into the bacterium.
They identified the DNA in the soil with radioactive phosphate or the protein in the soil with radioactive sulfur and conducted two (2) tests.
The effects of mutations can vary depending on the mutation, the importance of the mutated genetic material, and whether the atoms have been altered by the sequence of the genes.
Only mutations in germ-lineage cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism is a major attraction for people who visit natural places to enjoy the scenery, including flora and fauna.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and reading information about the environment are examples of on-site activities.
For example, the Arkantuang in Borneo, to photograph, learn and explore.
Every morning, people drive from small towns to their workplace, and they pass by other people who work at the place they leave to go to their workplace.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected and served by a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this giant carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
Have you ever heard similar complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges in developed countries?
The report also states that the "high-speed" traffic is "the most common form of traffic congestion in the world". The report also states that "the majority of traffic accidents are caused by the failure of the transport system".
Traffic congestion is the study of the movement and interaction of vehicles and individual drivers between two points.
Unfortunately, it is a little difficult to study traffic flow because it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with a 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to operate vehicles within a reasonable range; thus, traffic has a reasonable consistency and is mathematically represented.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between three key attributes: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly allows them to easily evade predators and to find food and mates efficiently.
Most insect species have developed the ability to fold their wings back onto their bodies.
This provides them with a wide range of small shelters to escape from the fierce animals.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the thumb and tail butterflies.
A thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right and some people thought he was wrong, that the solar system, including the sun, revolves around the earth (and other stars).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It has 8 times more water than the second largest river.
At six miles wide, the Amazon River is the widest river on earth.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the sea comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller streams.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were unmatched in size and construction techniques.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed to find monuments built by their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its law and official communications.
Although Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, Italian is also the language of daily life for working people in the country.
The Vatican City is a city of Roman Catholics.
People know about the basic chemical elements that were extracted in ancient times, like gold, silver and copper, because they were all found in nature's primitive form, and mining with primitive tools was easy.
The philosopher Aristotle said that everything is made by the combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
He also thought that the four states of matter were the same (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but that they would become new matter, forming what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two (2) or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
The elements calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals such as gold and silver.
You can get alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly small, but you could have a trillion of them at the end of this line.
Thus, pencils were a good friend to many people when they were first made.
It is a pity that, with the advent of new writing systems, the pencil has been reserved for less status and uses.
People are now typing messages on the computer screen, and they don't have to go near a pencil sharpener to do it.
When it comes to something new, one can wonder what magic the keyboard can do.
Fusion pumps work on the principle of using energy to link a nucleus together with multiple protons and neutrons.
Releasing some of that energy by splitting the embryo is like rolling a heavy cart up a hill.
Some have non-nuclear nuclei, which means they can split if they're only slightly or not at all broken.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
Its crust is about 70 km thick on the inside and 100 km thick on the outside.
It is thin under the dark portion of the Moon's surface and thick under the highlands.
Since the top layer is thin, there may be more maria on the near side. The volcano was easy to climb to the surface.
Content theory is about what people want or what people choose.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that are internalized as they reach maturity.
These theories look at people and make them do what they want to do, and then examine what their environment makes them do and what it doesn't.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
"In general, two (2) types of behavior may emerge when managers lead those who were previously in their equilibrium. One (1) edge of the spectrum is 'being one of the others.'"
Such managers may have difficulty in making difficult decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities and holding them accountable for their actions.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unidentified individual, who thinks he or she has to change everything the group has done and create as they wish.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behaviour often causes a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are just as good as regular teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Virtual group members often act as contact and helpers for the group of people next to them.
They often have more autonomy than regular teams, because their teams may be in different time zones, which may not be understood by the local administration.
The existence of an invisible matrix (Larson and La Pasteau, 1989, p. 109) is a characteristic component of virtual matrices.
The "invisible team" is the management team, and all the members report to them about their status. The invisible team grades each member.
Why does the company want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning institution? The only goal of putting institutional learning concepts into practice is to use innovation.
When all the resources and all the departments in an organization are put to good use, creativity and intelligence can be used by everyone.
As a result, a company's process of working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer demand.
Before a company can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organizational learning with co-workers.
Angel (2006) explains that the use of continuous methodology can lead to large scale performance gains.
Neurological data provide the most compelling evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, so it makes the research area more concise and accurate.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is helping scientists research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, ulcers, and tumors, affect activities and cause some changes in mood.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
It provides more information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand our minds.
Although AI is a major concern in science fiction, AI is also an important branch of computer science dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent transformation.
Research on AI involves building machines that automate sophisticated tasks.
Examples include control, planning and organization, the ability to detect customer demand and answer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Things like this have become separate fields, which focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
AI systems are now mostly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it has been installed in many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. A teacher would often like to take her students to places where the bus cannot travel.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can visit museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in their class.
Sharing the field trip in a visual way is a way to better represent the journey and share the experience with prospective classes.
For example, each year the Pennant School of North Carolina students design a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is redesigned, but older versions are made available for scraping online.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. It is often with poor grammar and spelling errors that students begin the blogging experience, and the presence of the audience usually changes them.
Since students are the most important people, bloggers work hard to avoid controversy.
"Blogs also 'make readers curious about the world around them. The idea of feeding readers' curiosity makes them intelligent and interesting' (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that can help students to motivate and collaborate in learning well beyond the actual school day.
"The proper use of blogs can make students more critical and analytical; they can help respond to the opinions of their peers and take a stand of their own when answering online questions" (O'Reac, 2002). "
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital and home to an array of art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's heritage and innovation.
The Niagara Falls in the southern corner, and Muskogee and its backsides in the north, are of unspoiled natural beauty.
All of these things, and more, highlight how Ontario is considered by many to be the best Canadian.
Larger areas further north are very densely populated, and some are almost uninhabited desert.
A demographic comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans in the United States than citizens of Canada.
The East African Archipelago is the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is huge, and when it comes to wildlife, it's considered a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands were either separate nations or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.

European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
It is surrounded by the Sahel region on the north and the Atlantic Ocean on the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveller declare herself married irrespective of her original marital status.
It is not very expensive, but it is useful for wearing a ring.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can be considered harassment and that following us and holding our hands is not unusual.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to take your stand (even if there are cultural differences, that's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Barbary fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Darro l-Badya, and it was given the name Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to buy things in all of Morocco.
Around the Old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as daegins, pottery, leather goods, hooks and spectrum of geeks, but this is only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist resort in the eastern corner of the Democratic Republic of Congo near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Cooma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which destroyed all the city's streets and especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, research needs to be done to understand the state of the ongoing fighting outside Goma, in northern Goma province.
The town is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla viewing in Africa.
You can use the Bode-Bode (motorcycle taxi) to get around the coma. Usually a short (local) ride costs ~500 Congolese Francs.
"Despite its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has been used as a metaphor for the ideal, distant lands.
Today, Timbuct is a declining town, although the town attracts tourists with its reputation and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of the world's oldest sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It is one of the main stops of the PBS special Wonders of the African World, by Henry Louis Gates.
It is completely different from the rest of the country because it has an Arabic flavor rather than an African flavor.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Mulla River to the east.

It is one of the major attractions in South Africa and is considered the premier of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily security and entry fees.
It is more useful to purchase a (1) Wildcard which grants access to all national parks in South Africa or to specific parks in South Africa.
The Hong Kong Islands are the namesake of the Hong Kong territory and are the focal point for all travellers.
The parade of Hong Kong's skyscrapers has been compared to a bar chart in the waters of Victoria Harbour, which appears to be glittering.
To see the best sights of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kaohsiung Reservoir.
Most of Hong Kong's suburban development is concentrated on the northern shore, on reclaimed land.
This is the place where the British colonists considered it their home, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is the best place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest marshland in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the Bangladeshi and Indian coasts.
Sundarvan forests have been declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of Sundarvan within the Indian border is known as Sundarvan National Park.
These forests are not just wetland forests, but also a last remaining part of the dense forest that once covered the Ganges plain.
The reserve forest covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is in water/sandlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is home to an estimated 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and some 30,000 Potala deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially buses heading east, and Jagar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance as the buses between districts are often crowded.
Many districts are served by small, comfortable and powerful Japanese coaches.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Baro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiaboque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oiaboque River, connecting the city of Oiaboque, Brazil, with the city of Saint Georges d'Oiaboque, French Guiana.

The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017 when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are ready.
The most notable indigenous group is the Quarani, a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, who also subsist on agriculture.
The Chaco area is home to other indigenous tribes, the Guaicuru and the Baihua, who hunt, gather, and fish.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born out of the struggle between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups in what was then known as the Great Province of India.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of the city in 1537, Paraguay has retained its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and athletes in the world.

For information on polo games and where to buy tickets, see Association Argentine de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is set at a value equal to one British Pound (GBP).
The FIC West store is the only bank in the islands located in Stanley that can be used for money transfers.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere within the Islands and Stanley area and credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
In the outer islands, credit cards are not accepted for purchases with American or British money, so ask the owners in advance which payment method is correct.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change the currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is winter in the northern hemisphere, but summer in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; summer temperatures are normally around +30 degrees C.
Winters can be deceptively cold; temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the combination of air and humidity can make it feel cooler than the thermometer indicates.
There is no such thing as a monsoon or a dry season. The amount of rainfall is approximately the same throughout the year.
Even though most of the animals in the park have seen humans, wild animals are wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, the recommended distance from bears and wolves is 100 yards, and from other wildlife 25 yards!
Although they may seem tame, elk, moose, bear, and almost all other large animals are aggressive.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain proper distancing. These animals are large, unrestrained and dangerous, and they must be given their own space.
Additionally, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.

The Belgian standard is hot chocolate, the fruit juices are expensive, but they are good.
Many expeditions are made to the rocks throughout the year, and injuries from these causes on the rocks are rare.
However, seek advice from the authorities and follow the instructions and pay attention to safety warnings.
From October to April 1770, box jellies are found near beaches and river basins. During these times they are rarely seen outdoors.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
The saltwater crocodiles are not abundant in the sea, and their primary habitat is along the riverside north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can provide a great deal of relief to the traveler, since there is room for sleeping anywhere as soon as he arrives.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is possible to book other accommodation facilities such as camping grounds through travel agents.
Generally, travel agents will provide a combination of breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or sometimes flight and hotel packages.
They may also hold your appointment if you need time to think about the offer or to buy other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
During some festivals, the majority of festival goers decide to stay at the campsite and the majority of visitors consider it the most important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to hurry to get a campsite closer to the music.
Even if the concert on the main stages is over, some sections of the festival will continue to play at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.

Travellers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount of money on mainly alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which passes through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to travelling on country roads, be aware that steep paths, narrow alleys and small curves are likely to appear.
The speed limits specified are significantly lower than those of the preceding and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and adhering to them correctly is more important than anything else.
However, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other routes on these routes, for example the Pennsylvania Wild West.
German pastry/cake and other flour products are very good, and in Bavaria they are as luxurious and varied as in its southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastry is common, apples are cooked in pastry all year round, and cherries and plums appear in summer.
Many German baked goods contain dried nuts of almonds, hazelnuts and other trees. The well-known cake varieties are often the perfect match for a thick coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try a pastry called berliner, fancocon or graphene, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with meat or vegetables.
"A broth can be either ""dry"" or ""wet"" depending on the amount of liquid".

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catchall term for a wide range of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, without the use of further qualification criteria, the term refers to food from central and eastern Java.
Now, widely available across many of the islands' collection, Javanese cuisine includes a range of processed foods and the main flavors Javanese like are stuffed carrots, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The riders are supported by a saddle ring hanging down the sides of the saddle.
They provide great stability for the rider, although safety concerns are raised due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck.
When a rider is thrown, if the foot gets caught in the bridle, the horse is likely to be dragged while running. Several safety precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
First, most riders wear soft, heeled, short boots.
Next, some harnesses, especially English harnesses, have safety bars that help a horse fall off the harness if it is pulled backwards by a fallen rider.
The Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing area, known as the Yosemite of South America, has large walls of various granite and steep cliffs.

Skiing is a popular sport, with skis or a snowboard on your feet, and is played on snow-covered terrain. Skiing and snowboarding are also popular.
"Skiing is a major activity for many travel enthusiasts, who occasionally plan ski 'ski bum' at a specific location throughout the holiday".
Skiing is very old - cave paintings show skiers as far back as 5000 BC.
Skiing down hills has been a sport since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Recreational Skiing Association was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski tourism or snowboarding.
It is related to, but not the same as, alpine style ski touring or mountaineering. The latter is usually done on steep terrain and requires very difficult skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
In the best case, the distance can be increased by crossing the slopes - but cross-country skiing can often be speeded up on tracks for overweight men.
Although Europe is a relatively small continent, it is composed of many separate countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries requires multiple visa applications and passport controls.
However, the Schengen area acts as one country in this regard.
As long as you live in the area, you can cross the border without passport control and checks.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal chart for which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items as antiques that are over 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age range may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
