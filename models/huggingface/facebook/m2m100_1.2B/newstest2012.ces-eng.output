Parliament rejects proposal to liberate Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament has rejected a proposal to repeal the paragraph on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted in the framework of the amendment of the Criminal Code.
The amendment, which would open the way for the release of the imprisoned ex-prime minister, the MPs rejected in the second reading of the proposal to ease the penalties for economic crimes.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for signing a allegedly unfavorable gas contract with Russia.
The verdict is not final, the appeal of the convicted is due to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko describes the verdict as a political revenge of the regime, suspicion of the court’s bias has triggered the trial in the West.
The proposal to remove paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the former prime minister was convicted, was supported by 147 deputies.
226 votes were needed to pass it.
Libyan victory
The story of Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and is without him after the war.
The winner remains to be defined.
As is customary in the region, in the elections Islamists win, but the question is whether moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to the customary law of Sharia, and we already have a certain idea about it.
Libya will become a country without crime, because theft is a hand cut off.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostates from the faith await execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, a society of rival tribes will unite the Qur’an.
There will be an order in Libya which we cannot imagine and which we would not want.
But our way of life is neither the only one, nor objectively the best, and probably would not fit the Libyans for change.
In fact, it is strange that Islamic fighters have taken the help of unbelieving dogs.
The only excuse is that, from their point of view, NATO’s airstrikes were not directed by a general from America, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated in every successful intervention.
So when winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We took part in the shooting, served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of a dictator, got rid of a political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
This leads to the eviction of the “crucifiers”.
But will oil companies have Libya’s black gold as a hubi?
It may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of the self-sufficient protection of human rights.
Unless the law of Sharia is enforced.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are looking for investors.
Statistical shrinkage overtook Europe on Tuesday.
The United States has released GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy has stagnated inter-quarterly, Germany and France are growing.
The bond market is breaking records.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistical authorities in the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have released preliminary estimates of the economic development for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by 0.5% and France by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany was next to better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), while France said it appeared in a mild decline of 0.1% (original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year.
However, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated in the quarter and confirmed the trend of gradual slowing growth in the performance of the economy.
The results are worse than analyst estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated in the quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonal data.
The eurozone and the European Union’s economies grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analyst expectations.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2 percent.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish bonds are rising to critical limits.
The problems are also beginning to be felt by Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The yields on Czech 10-year bonds remain below 4%, even though the situation in the region is deteriorating.
The European Central Bank (ECB) should be the ultimate creditor.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
In Montenegro, they won 1:0 and celebrate the progress for 200 million
The football team managed the toughest task of the season.
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech and beautiful goalkeeper Petra Jiráčka won 1:0.
Czech football, even with a great portion of luck in the second half, has captured the luxury advance from domestic retaliation and will again not be missing in the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the progressive match in a detailed report.
Hardly any excitement in the first half and a lot of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, thanks to the domestic breakdown in the finish, the great Czech and hero Jiráček won in Montenegro happily 1:0 and celebrates the progress to the European Championship.
In the second half, the Czechs were under pressure because of the precise defense.
The winners of the match were Damjanovich and Vučinič, who burned two great chances.
Thanks to the great Peter Čech, the Czech national team will not be missing the European Championship next year, and a reward of approximately 200 million crowns will be added to the national football box office.
A lot of football has been played since the start.
Both teams had difficulty joining in a combination and played mostly around the half line.
The pressure of the domestic footballers therefore did not come in the first half, long purchases for defense because the Czech defense was precisely deterred.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
Creating a Living Shield
Several hundred college students have formed a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed in front of the facility at noon on Tuesday and then proclaimed death to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students from the universities in Iran’s Isfahan have formed a living shield around the Isfahan nuclear technology center, where uranium is being processed.
They are ready to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a recent report that Iran appears to have continued to pursue nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is being talked about in Israel.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then proclaimed the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at paralyzing the Iranian nuclear program as much as possible, the Israeli press said that in addition to the Isfahani center, the target would also be a facility in Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: does not eat breakfast and dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with overweight 9 percent of schoolchildren and obese 5 percent of children.
Obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, according to a recent survey.
Again, it shows how important the environment in which he grows and the patterns with which he is surrounded are for the healthy development of a person.
For example, on tables in obese children, smoking occurs up to half as often as in families of children with a normal weight.
Strawberries had to dinner the day before a research-related awareness event called Obesity is not a coincidence for more than 19 percent of obese.
In families with obesity, it is also unusual to play sports, but this applies to most families of today’s schoolchildren – only 15 percent of children responded that their parents would find time for active exercise at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and involved almost 900 children from elementary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of the Obesity is not a coincidence event, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 students from 4th to 8th grade have participated in the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient movement in the family is one of the determining factors that causes the dramatically rising number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of those surveyed said they ate five times a day in the breakfast-sweat-lunch-sweat-dinner mode, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition," the study said.
No Breakfast and Evening
Experts point out that for healthy development are important and relative details, including the regular time of family breakfast.
Only 23% of schoolchildren eat breakfast at the same time.
Most families eat breakfast on their own.
And the worst was the finding that one in ten households did not eat at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The survey showed that in families with obese children, unhealthy chips are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
Regularly, more than 40 percent of the children surveyed do sports, but their parents had less than half the result - 15 percent.
Set up your dining table
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build their own diets from the offered options according to their own taste and opinion.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite dishes are lots of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
"Alarming is especially the high popularity of sweet lemonades," the final report of the survey states.
For lunch, the main meal was pasta over poultry.
Children, however, practically didn’t want legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and lunch vegetable dishes is low.
Tender to Health
The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they are given the right information.
“In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the awareness lecture Obesity is not a coincidence, there was in a number of cases a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition,” the project results state.
This is especially true in the case of sweet lemonade, where more children would prefer regular water.
Children were also much more likely to check out poultry and fish in the questionnaire as the main meal of the day and would restrict sweet foods and knobs.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the introductory article about how stylists are taught, I complained so little that there was a lot of it already in the opening hours.
I did not know what would follow.
Lectures by three professionals from the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes to the square.
It will be worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it’s really “stricken”.
This time we discussed with the director Alenka (there is no single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who has no perfectly proportional figure.
Such is the overwhelming majority.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boy's figure without proper curves, and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically smooth the wide shoulders, extend the neck or provide the necessary curves.
We received such tips as for women like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. larger breasts and hips and narrow waist, to emphasize the figure pretty well and at the same time not to dress a woman too challengingly.
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is such that the dress or trousers really don’t fit, then it is worth letting you seat at least one such piece on a custom.
You will not regret it, because perfectly fit clothes are not worth paying.
In a suit you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves, wraps, stays in the waist, and so on.
The boy figure, in turn, can afford to wear clothes with scissors, applications, browsing or picking up.
There are, of course, a lot of such information and types of characters, so I’m glad that I have a whole week to sort out all the information in my head.
I am also afraid that, given the homework, it will be enough.
Each of the courses was assigned a celebrity to whom two outfits should be invented: day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, fashion style of a given personality and the type of character.
I’m going to “dress” Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria’s Secret campaigns.
In the spirit of joy, for me personally definitely better than such Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained a hundred kilos (take, please, consider the overload), or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut out clothes from magazines or search on the Internet and print them and then graphically process them.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, then expresses our personal style and relationship to graphic appearance.
Thinking about the graphic side of styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates so-called product pages in magazines (for specific entries, such as trendy bags, coats, etc.).
This is what stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us.
But only on Sunday.
The designer must have a general view.
The Saturday lecture, loaded with information about the types of characters, was spotted by three guests from the industry.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should be able to use it.
And a clever stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is crucial in this case.
Thus, such a trenchcoat (or if you want to originally trenchcoat) can be worn classic over jeans and t-shirt as a coat, but you can also wear it on the bare body, put on boots and photograph it as a dress.
Or just wrap your sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different.
“Play with it,” he stressed.
But most of all I appreciated the following advice: "To work, you need to know the rules perfectly."
“Then you can start breaking them,” said Jacob.
Finally, it is clear to me why we crush all those lessons, what to combine with, what to do, why, when in fashion magazines sometimes we see something different.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more variants of clothes than they can be photographed.
So for a fashion story that will have ten pages (i.e., ten outfits), I have to be prepared to “set up” at least fifteen.
And also that on the photo of the clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces sometimes completely different than in reality.
This is what we need to take into account when creating outfits.
That image and style sometimes make up to half the success, Honza Humble confirmed.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miraculous singer, but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to stylist services is rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes consider it unnecessary (it is enough that I know something, the way I look at it is secondary).
And if someone lets us create a styling, then we have to count on the fact that it is likely to dictate a completely different (lesser) size than it really has.
Then it remains only to google and find out if the boulevard did not write about the fact that a given celebrity has grown/lost and the like.
Honza and Mario on Sunday put us on the heart that the stylist is not enough to be oriented in fashion and know how to put together the outfit.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he clothes, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Be able to judge people, not deceive yourself, stand by your own opinions.
“When a manager orders you to change your closet and add nice pieces to it, you can’t throw the whole closet out and say, ‘God, it’s a horror.’”
"Find at least a few things there that you can praise and recommend what they can wear for," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what everything must contain the so-called "plate" or bag.
It is the one that you turn on around the waist and have all the necessary properties with you.
In addition to bright things, such as scissors, hair rollers or shutters, there is also a silicone thread (with which the stylist helps to photograph products, such as bags or hats), special clips that we put on the back of the clothes if they are larger (the shutters or other clamps are not permitted, they would spoil the clothes), or a sewing.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly glue the shoes.
Even when photographing in a studio where there is a flat surface, the shoulder could be damaged, let alone outside.
So we grabbed and grabbed.
The knives should not be touched in order not to be accidentally damaged.
It really requires skill.
Mario pleased me when he praised my creation unreservedly.
This skill is not really my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
It is becoming increasingly clear to me that engaging in styling at a professional level is really not a walk in a pink set, no matter who wants what he wants.
Need for Speed: The Run races across America.
Recensions
Originally, the careless ride turns into a routine morning trip to the shift due to a series of completely unnecessary laidback mistakes.
The ambition has largely been fulfilled, but it is not valid when nobody obviously wanted to do anything extra.
The new episode, titled The Run, had high expectations before it was released.
He promised that the long-standing racing series of Need for Speed would once again move in a new direction, and from the playable shows he appeared as a game that would not have to be counted in the genre of action racing.
We were also curious how the inserted passages, in which the main character will get out of the car and go on his way.
As with the NFS series, it is customary, many results are a little different than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole pulls down a few unnecessary mistakes that have appeared in the series more or less for several years.
So this is actually not even a mistake, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are brought into a story whose protagonist Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea brings with it a few interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race runs on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don’t have the feeling that the game is always the same.
Some of the environments are also very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
This is nothing worldly.
But riding across the desert, the autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains is visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are spotted from time to time with some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you will get into a sandstorm, which greatly reduces visibility.
In the mountains, you have to be careful not to get caught by a lava.
In addition, the individual races are well arranged.
There are only a few types, but that is enough.
For a while, you try to outperform the desired number of opponents (in essence, a classic race), then you catch up with the time (a classic match with a stopper) and then you are waiting for a duel with a single opponent.
From time to time, the police are also involved in this, which makes your efforts even more frustrating.
There are passages outside the car.
It’s more about such interactive animations, where Jack mostly runs away from someone and you have to help him in this by pressing the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, there are far fewer passages in the game than you would expect (per only three).
As a result, this is to the benefit of the thing, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and in the context of the aforementioned it is so ranked among the elements that spread the game.
The driving model follows the tracks of the previous parts.
That is, it is definitely not known nowadays, but it cannot be said that it would be a negative.
If you’re looking for a realistic simulation, you’ll have to look elsewhere.
But the more action-conscious racing model still suits quite well, even though we could find better at the competition.
Until then, everything is in perfect order.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the model, the collision model is no longer very good.
From the game of this type, we do not expect to count complex deformations and collisions, but if you have no idea how your car will behave before any impact on any object, then probably not everything is fine.
Typically, when you close ahead or bypass cars in regular traffic, you sometimes only slightly lick each other, but other times in a identical situation your car ends up in wild piruets.
Or even directly.
Thanks to the restart system, it does not bother, but it will break you reliably.
Restarts are resolved in such a way that if you break up or get out of the track, the game throws you back to the last point on the track.
Only five restarts are available in each race.
Once you have exhausted them, you have to start the race from the beginning.
It is therefore more such a help in the event that something does not work, than that you could rely on them explicitly.
Sometimes even restarts do not help, solving them up to the need to learn a given section of the race to remember.
The big drawback of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some turns, for example, need to be done in a specific way, otherwise you will not get into them.
Other times you will encounter “civil” cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying when you see the opponent easily pass between two opposing cars before you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to circumvent or brake them.
It doesn’t matter when you get to them, because it’s “calculated” so that the situation is always right before your nose.
Competitors have another advantage.
Thro the game, you will encounter several locations where, regardless of time, the same opponent will always outperform you in the same place.
This is most important at the end of the game on the long bridge, where you drive in the opposite direction.
The enemy must get there before you obviously at any cost.
When it runs in front of you, it makes the overview of opposite cars worse, so you start off there a few times.
You can understand the intention of making the game more thrilling and adrenaline-like, but the execution is so obvious that it reliably quickly discourages you.
And it’s a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and in places even so actionful that sometimes you literally don’t get to watch where it’s flying.
And it doesn’t really matter if the concept with fifty unique tracks is worth it, whether it is to sort races so that boredom doesn’t have a chance, or anything else.
It’s an unusual idea to change cars during races.
You have to be careful about gas pumps on the roads, because you can change the car there, although in the vast majority of cases you will get enough of what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American railroads for straight highways and exotic supersports for technical riding, for example, on cliffy mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand and the challenge mode, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you gain not only medals, but also experience points into your profile, which is common for challenges and story.
To gain a higher level of driver, various objects are unlocked: starting with cars and ending with the backgrounds for the profile.
It is also connected with the online Autolog feature, which, among other things, compares your achievements with other players and provides additional community features.
One of the other hard-to-understand tricks is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the metro tunnel (budiž), where you will drive it in the dark on the rails (budiž).
On the tachometer, the numbers blink between 150 and 200 km/h (by the way), and in this, the subway set will be attached from the back and will uncompromisingly scratch you.
In the editorial, we will probably have a discussion for a few days about whether when creating the game nobody really did not think a little, or whether the authors think of us as really such a big fool.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It is so frightening that in some more intense moments the shooting decreases, and in some cases quite tragically.
This applies, however, primarily to the bullshit with a greater number of participants, when a smooth shooting would no longer be valid.
The sound side is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to please the widest possible range of rather younger audiences, a soundtrack from the category "every dog is different", but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, the game will probably not be bought.
Need for Speed: The Run is a big deal.
If the game avoided completely unnecessary mistakes, then we’t be afraid to say that The Run is the best NFS game of the last few years.
This is how the game works outright.
Fun is definitely fine, but be prepared for the fact that mistakes will shake you in the eye with the power of airport reflectors.
UK singers sing at Student Samet concert
The combination of the celebrations of the International Day of Students and the anniversary of the Samet Revolution with a musical experience is being offered by Festa Academica for the third time.
During the course, 20 high school and university singing choirs will be presented.
The main focus of the festival are two concerts held on November 17.
“The University of Karlovy Vary has a big share of the festival.”
"Among the participating bodies is the Choral Choir of the Faculty of Pedagogy and the Faculty of Humanities, in the festival committee will meet the rector Václav Hampl," said the head of the organizational team Jakub Čaloun.
The highlight of the whole festival is the public open concert of high school choirs, which will take place on November 17 from 14 a.m. in the area in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvic.
On the show is the song of the renowned Czech jazzman Karla Růžičky Celebration Jazz Mass.

Detailed information can be found on the festival website www.festaacademica.cz
Ambassador to the EU Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation of negativists and eurosceptics
“The Lisbon Treaty has significantly disrupted the balance between the various institutions.”
“I didn’t expect it to be such a tough war.”
"It will take five, six years before the situation settles a little, calms down and before all players get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicen said.
How seriously she takes her motto "Understandably and openly about Europe", she showed in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and comprehensible way that she could be envious by a number of lecturers from the UK Law School.
Vicen also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
“First of all, there was criticism that he was insignificant, that he was a grey official, that he couldn’t play any role, and I have to say that everyone was breathtaking, that he performed well in that role.”
He is a person who can listen to the 27 member states, communicate well with them, and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go.”
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as a response to the question: "Who is the European Union? to which phone number should I call?", thus as a significant step towards unification and greater readability of the EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our cakes.
Vicen also addressed the agenda that the European Council lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency was a success.
The Czechs addressed the emerging financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis, or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of the government at this time as a great negativum, which severely damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech delegation in the EU is currently very busy.
Speaking in the words of the ambassador, "fakt frmol" was not only the presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is addressed to this day.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union has yet to be approved, which is complicated by the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and economical, which sectors will be preferred, which countries will be supported more and which less, all of this is on the agenda of the upcoming negotiations.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "About Europe understandably."
“I really don’t like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, handicaps that no one understands.
How should the citizen understand that there are really no curved or round cucumbers in Brussels, bananas of varying sizes, or that we really have to be banned from cheeses.”
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of eurosceptics and people who pay attention to the negative side rather than the positive side of the matter.
This is due to the low representation of Czechs in the European Union.
There are many factors to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, but also the low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
“Believe me, when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, the Frenchman next to me will say, ‘Hey, what do you meet there, what about your Visegrad four?’ and he doesn’t look enthusiastic about it at all.”
In the future, the EU, according to Vicen, mainly awaits new tough rules for budgetary policies of member countries.
He then sees the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, rather than a new “European federation” as very real.
“There are countries in the euro area and countries outside the euro area.”
“We have the Schengen area, we have the institute of enhanced cooperation.”
“For the first time, it was said that only countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t want to stay away.”
“These institutions will be more and it will be a strong two-speed Europe,” Vicen expects.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role played by the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all issues affecting the Union as a whole should be discussed between all Member States, not just between the euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to look for the word that most accurately describes IBM’s strategy, the closest one would probably be “long-term”.
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, and yet it has been a hundred years since its founding.
The foundation of this long term was laid by the company’s first CEO, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He said that many of the world’s problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan “Think!” became the imprint around which the life of the future giant will unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine that began to appear at IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson’s carefully built corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained faithful to its core values and was not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope we can even more in the second hundred,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current CEO of the company.
SOFTWARE SYSTEM
In the 1930s, Watson approached caring for his employees in the same way as entrepreneur Baťa did in the Czech Republic – IBM employees were among the first Americans to have paid leave, employer insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system to reward the best inventors and merchants.
IBM has a long-standing relationship with its customers.
The company has been brilliant in talent harvesting from the outset – being one of the world’s first companies to eliminate any discrimination so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana will be replaced next year by a woman, Virginia Rometty.
She has been working at IBM for 30 years and still holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called jams, online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
It’s no surprise that there are plenty of ideas – almost half a million people work in the company.
Institutions with a good name
A firm position in the business is ensured by the firm’s strong internal and external image.
“From the very beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a technology company,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard Business School professor and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and thus creating the market.
IBM – or “Great Blue,” as it is familiarly referred to in the United States because of its logo – has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a hundred years.
It is probably the most versatile technology company – it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of all U.S. technology companies, and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include a ATM, a payment card, a financial swap, a barcode or a disk.
With approximately $220 billion, IBM became the second largest technology company in terms of market capitalization this year (first is Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look forward
Not all products and innovations hit the taste of customers and the time - for example, IBM failed to bet on its own operating system OS/2, online service Prodigy or IBM PCjr.
“If your business is built on moving forward, you can’t be emotionally attached to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms – and when they don’t work, leaving them.
In contrast to the competitor Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective Technology
The largest share of IBM’s sales are services, with software and hardware accounting for about a fifth.
At the same time, in 1990, it was the strongest representative of hardware with more than half of the share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-profit assets, and invested $58 billion in future technologies over the same period.
It has continued to invest since 2008, when the global financial crisis struck the world for the first time.
IBM is acting according to the message of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during the great economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis untouched.
IBM’s stock price has risen by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, while the company’s net profit continues to grow.
IBM’s motto is to change everything but not your values.
We can therefore expect that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will handle it.
IBM History: From a Cheese Cutter to Space Flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a century ago, originally under the complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was first adopted in 1924 as a brand used by the company’s branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later IBM was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They owned technologies such as the famous “pistols,” which are clocks that record the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, a businessman who also chaired the company’s supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a competitive firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The leader then overshadowed IBM’s founder – Watson’s ideas have built an unbeatable corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name implies, began with the manufacture and sale of all kinds of machines for business - from meat and cheese cutting machines to cash machines.
During the first four years of Watson’s leadership, the company’s turnover doubled to $9 million and the company expanded to all continents.
Watson was so important to the company that he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior, after almost forty years in the chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, humans and computers from IBM helped NASA steer flights into space - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight of man to the Moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360.
The IBM 5150 was introduced to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to Lenovo, bought the consultancy division of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began dedicating itself fully to consultancy and value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, a "smarter planet".
Its aim is to use technology intelligently in areas not yet planned and to improve the situation, for example, in transportation or city management.
For the area of commerce, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps marketers manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
She established her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a world-class voice recognition research team.
About an unfaithful husband:
I don’t want it, I don’t want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) has said the end!
After her husband, Joseph Rychtari (53), became not only the protector of Ivety Bartoš (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now she no longer intends to wait and has set clear rules for her next life.
"Pepa can go home, but not as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová granted asylum to Bartoš in her home in the summer, she probably didn’t even dream of how her marriage would eventually end.
Despite Iveta's urge to move from Greece after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, reconciled with her husband's relationship and now even said goodbye to him forever.
He doesn’t care who his wife is sleeping with.
If Rychtář and Bartoš had just split up once, his wife’s open arms would not wait for him at home.
“He’s the biological father of my sons and if he wants to live his life in our common home, no one will drive him out.”
"But he will not live as my beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Rychtářová said, adding that she has already left her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
For Joseph, Darina closed the back door to him.
“I respect my wife’s decision.
“I’m going to be with Ivan and I’m not going to change it.”
“My wife set up a paper marriage and I respect it.”
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, property, buy."
"We have a very normal conversation with Darina, just not sharing beds," Rychtář told Blesku.
If she finds a new love, she won’t stop her.
“We don’t sleep together and I don’t care where he’s going, with whom he’s going, or if he has any friends.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Ivetta and I take all responsibility,” Josef concluded.
Women’s Worst Habits: Do They Relate to You?
When you ask men if they could list some typical female bad habits, they’ll usually get out of their sleeves very quickly.
Dear women, will you recognize yourself in the following lines, where there are a few female bad habits that can perfectly pump the blood in the veins of men?
Shopping
Does your partner blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you need to wear at least one cloth a week?
Do you like to shop in bulk and in discounts?
In this case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should cut their shopping passion a bit.
But tell me, who would resist just walking around clothing stores, looking for well-fitting slides, and then try them all (ideally in different colors) in the cabin?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, it can become literally a hell for men.
Just remember how many times you have told your friend to wait for you in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
“Do I like you at all?”
Do these words remind you of anything?
So yes?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of this complaint increases, the more annoying the women are.
Order and cleanliness first
It is like an endless wheel.
Washing the windows, vacuuming, cleaning the tiles, cleaning the dust, rubbing the bath - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping your dirty legs on a clean tiles, your children for dirty washing rooms, and the glass wall of the living room that you have put so much work into polishing?
In the event that you suffer from this "challenge", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not be the first place within the family.
This harmless desire for purity can endanger your relationships and family well-being.
Rhythm
Throw the worn clothes into the basket.
“Will you wear those socks tomorrow?”
A wet towel does not belong to the ground.
If you do this several times a day, know that you can call your partner reliably.
Of course, you don’t mean it badly, you want to make sure everything goes well.
Maybe if men knew it, women’t have to grasp them so much.
blasphemy, blasphemy
For some women, blasphemy, gossip, but also insults and conspiracy against someone are also characteristic.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us will get a little bit of blasphemy or blasphemy here.
Hand on heart, it’s for all women.
But the opposite are the crumbs of the thickest grain, which love and often crumbs, disregard everyone and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the female work collective.
Jagger and Voráček assisted to win Philadelphia
Hockey striker Jaromír Jágr participated in Monday's NHL match with two assists on the victory of Philadelphia 5:3 on the ice of Carolina and is again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
From the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old star benefited in both cases Claude Giroux, who added another record and was proclaimed the best player of the match.
Two assists in the match was also recorded by Jagger's fellow player Jakub Voráček.
Jagger told overseas journalists after the match that he predicted a big evening for Giroux.
“I told him before the match that he would have a hattrick.”
“I felt it.”
“Sometimes you get that feeling,” explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored the first shot of the Flyers.
A few minutes later, the team’s second strike had a Czech footprint.
Voráček defeated the Hurricanes scroll behind the goal and presented it between the circles to the scoring Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer dropped in the weakening, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Especially the Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagger, he scored a third goal, then his shot turned into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he definitely belongs to the top three," Jagger said.
"I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him."
“I am happy about that.”
“I want to play for him.”
“All those years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play on me, and now it turns,” Jagger said.
Carolina made a drama from the match, the goal of Tuom Ruutua and again Dwyer, who went out of the penalty shooting, got the difference of one goal.
But another complication was not allowed by Matt Read, who ended the numbering two to one.
"He hit great in our Pronger belt."
"He pushed out the scroll, I picked up the speed and (Read) went to a more distant bar."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad that it went out," Voráček described the last goal of the match from his perspective.
Philadelphia won the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not play the match against Buffal, in the second third he resigned due to an injury in the upper part of the body.
Candiens, along with the experienced beak, also lost the two-goal leadership and lost after a penalty shot 2:3.
One of them did not change Tomáš Plekanec.
Instead of losing points, the home coach was scared by an extensive back row, with only five defenders playing the match.
“It is bad.”
“We only played with one experienced player, the rest were young players.
“But we can’t do anything about it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"The shift after the shift came upon us and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, pushing the puk out of our band."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty strikes Winnipeg to the win 5:2 over Tampou Bay.
The goals of the Jets, which interrupted the five-match series of losses, were shared by five different shooters.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At the time, the majority of travel agencies sold only tours to the countries of the Socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both on the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned to the West and Czech tourists' journeys to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely individually, even within the socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation from that country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered tours to the West, but it was necessary to stand the front overnight with a sleeping bag or to have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
However, it was not won either.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for trips to the West, was not given to “politically unreliable people” who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign exchange promise it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for the trip to the West.
Most often, however, the Czechs spent their holidays in the country, which resulted in a large number of houses and chalets that the Czechs purchased and this custom still exists today.
Czech travel has experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 vacation in the NDR or Bulgaria was our maximum, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
The huge paradox, which we do not realize today, is that it was not possible to travel freely to Croatia, which is currently the most popular for us, until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
At the end of the 1990s, the abolition of the visa requirement for neighboring Western European countries started a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria’s Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks were not able to take a trip to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
In Paris, for example, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents because our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
A typical feature of the travel of the Czechs at this time was driving their own food, canned food, salads, etc., to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally, after many decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living, and with it, average wages, however, rose, resulting in another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have begun to regularly prepare tours with charter airlines since 1997, thus air travel thanks to the possibility to obtain quantitative discounts compared to the past have grown incredibly low.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had visa-free access to virtually all developed countries of the world, except for the United States, which continued to make our travel easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when the first historically direct charter flight to exotic Thailand was delivered from the Czech Republic due to considerable demand.
From this year on, every year they fly with Czech tourists direct charters to warm distant countries, this winter it will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit these exotic countries annually.
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished visas for Czech tourists and thus our country definitively ranked among the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in history, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15 thousand CZK per person for one overseas vacation including costs at the place of residence.
The general assembly has to find the president, but again threatens pat
Czech football has been without a chairman for almost five months and there is a danger that the successor of Ivan Haška at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is no agreement on what electoral procedure will be implemented.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Interest in leading Czech football have Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June and when he left, he called on colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
However, in the era after Hashkov, football slipped back to the pitch between the two union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was announced on September 16 when a new president was elected.
The delegates of the general assembly gathered in the National House in Prague on Smíchov unnecessarily, because the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just about the method of election.
There was no agreement as to who actually has the right to vote in the assembly – whether only the statutory representatives, or even the functionaries entrusted with full power.
In this single point there has since been partial agreement, which has also been helped by the recommendation of the Constitution for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
There is still controversy over the electoral system.
The executive committee has not brought too clearly into the situation, which does not solve essentially anything else in its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary.
The view on the option of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to eliminate the possibility of heels?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or to find a different model," said one of the three FAČR vice presidents Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
According to the statutes of the proposed model, in the third round wins the candidate who will have a higher percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running.
It is said that Morava is willing to make concessions in order to win the candidate who gets the higher percentage of votes from both houses.
And the Czech side promotes the condition that the winner must obtain at least two-thirds superiority in this percentage.
"But it would then lose the meaning of the two previous rounds, it would completely deny the two-chamber concept," understands the objections of the Moravian party Svoboda, according to which it would be the best order not to bend and vote according to the current statutes.
This is somewhat surprisingly agreed with Tomáš Paclík, although it is estimated that the electoral order determined by the statutes most suits Pelt from all the candidates.
“I want to vote as much as possible.”
"In order not to invent any representative nonsense like in the previous general assembly," said owner Viktorie Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his remarks was primarily opposed to Pelt.
Pepe remains an optimist.
In Nymburk, according to him, the new president will be known and he believes that the candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"All the passions will be calmed by the possible progress of the national team to the European Championship today."
"Football, in turn, will be on a happy wave, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate," says the Jablonecki official, who has the greatest experience in managing football both at a professional and regional level.
Rachel is more restrained.
“I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very divided.”
“It’s not between people from the Czech Republic and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt regulations.”
“That can cause the blocking of the crowd to happen again.”
“I hope that common sense will prevail,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for agreement between the parties.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the match.
The air special, in which the vice-president Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorica, among others, did not fly from Prague in the morning due to a technical failure and was looking for a replacement option to transport part of the executive committee to the scene of barrage retaliation.
Finally, it may be a decisive meeting at the ministerial level, which mayly take place on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education Josef Dobeš would like to force the split parties within the strongest sports association in the country to a deal.
There is a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the planned general meeting of the ČSTV, which will solve the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
He goes on to fight for president because he doesn’t see a suitable candidate.
If the head of the football players of Plzno Tomáš Paclík before the extraordinary general assembly saw a strong candidate, which would meet all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not even be in the struggle for the top position.
“If a good adept exists, I will fight for him and I will not go to the election.”
“But under the current situation, no one has been able to find such,” said ČTK Paclík.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelt and Jindřich Rajchl, Paclík is motivated to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favourite of the elections, on his way to the head of the FAČR.
Paclík also stressed that in the event of his victory, he would only last in the role of president until 2013, when there is an ordinary general assembly on the agenda.
In the role, he would look forward to seeing an experienced and top-notch manager who is not too connected with football.
"With some people who would come into consideration, I spoke."
"It was crazy for me when some people said that at the moment they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
“I would like to change that view,” he said.
Paclíkov is now most bothered by Pelt’s connection with the chairman of the Plzeňský krajský fotbalový svaz Roman Berber, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates at the general assembly.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík to have Pelta stand in the presidency position.
“If he wins, it will keep the current state and nothing in football will move forward.”
"Combined with the support of Berbra, who is a good businessman, it would not benefit football even more," Paclík said.
It also appears that Pelt's name was heard years ago in the interrogation during the investigation of the corruption affair, from which Pelta came out without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And how would we also look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," Paclík said, who, however, has also taken his former statement that he would "sell the Plzeň club if Pelta became president."
If Paclík triumphed in Thursday’s election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Peltou.
The same is considered by another candidate Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
“He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go for.”
“He has great abilities.”
“I could imagine him as the head of the team.”
“But managing the association would not be able.”
"I also don't strike my nose where I can't," said Paclík, who in September attracted much attention by standing behind the appeal of the arbitration committee headed by Luďko Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
He claims he would be in charge of the association.
He refers to his skills from the management of private companies, since last summer he has also chaired Plzni, who with his support in May celebrated the Premier League triumph.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment, to contribute to its certain cultivation."
"To limit the influence of some interest groups, which may have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeal committee, which goes up to disgusting situations," Paclík said, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the Spartan boss Daniel Křetínský.
He would also consider one of the priorities to tighten the relations of the FAČR with the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby for political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"This is one of the key issues that the new president should address."
“If gambling is taxed, as declared by political parties, I understand their arguments, but they have to say where the money goes,” he said.
As a burden now Paclík does not take his connection with the Plzeň club, although he himself claims that the chairman of the FAČR should be "extraordinary".
Pelta is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague Dukla.
“It is not ideal.”
"I don't see any sense in the fact that I would hypocritically transfer my shares in the Plzeň club to someone and return there in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new FAČR statutes that would exclude electoral pat
Two days before the general assembly of the football association, one of the candidates for president Miroslav Pelta promised that in case of election, he would set up to make the FAČR have new statutes that would in the future definitively exclude disputes over the electoral order.
Jablonecký functionary is optimistic before Thursday's meeting in Nymburka and believes that the pre-election struggle will significantly suppress the possible success of today's football team.
Pelta has already promised before the September election that he intends to focus on representation and funding in the event of election.
He decided to go to the election before the last general assembly at the last moment, so a two-month delay could be useful for him to defend and present his ideas about football management in a broader context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday.”
“They feel that it is time for someone to lead the association,” says a man who is primarily associated with the Jablonec Club, but who has worked for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
He also believes that he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with elections is the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hasko.
“Unfortunately, the June General Assembly approved statutes that were not as perfect as everybody thought.”
"If different interpretations were not allowed, we had a president since September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the reworking of the most important document of the civil association that he understood as a veil to delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
“It’s a principled thing we can’t be without,” Pelta says.
He says he is not trying to compete with his opponents.
He previously said he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes because of his legal education, and he knows well that his counter-candidate would be his first vice president.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who, on the contrary, did not leave the thread dry on Pelt.
“He’s been playing football for over a year and has achieved a lot of success.”
"His attacks, however, were unworthy and a lot of people were struck by the way of the election campaign."
"Therefore, many of them are now questioning his true character," Pelt told the opponent's address, who is said to remain faithful to the proclamations he announced in September.
His most powerful weapon, according to him, is knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
This should be a game of soccer.
“And I would also try to end all the affairs, starting with the cause of the Bohemians or the echoes of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"I would immediately go on to negotiate with the private and state sectors to secure enough money for the whole football," the 46-year-old candidate said two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his arrival at the head of football would not mean any staff cleansing.
"I should first get acquainted with the individual staff," he referred to Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness from the long downturn.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk on Thursday in vain.
"If the only question is how we will vote in the third round, then we can pass through that."
“Football needs credibility, and it will only gain it by finally having its leader again,” Pelta remains an optimist two days before the decisive day of his functionary career.
Rajchl promises that under him the FAČR would begin to work hard
If Jindřich Rajchl was elected as the new chairman of the Czech Football Association at Thursday’s general assembly, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that he will work hard if he is elected.
He wants to push for systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work initiated by previous President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national team, professional football, performance football to youth."
"But I'm not saying that I would do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview with ČTK.
"I'm a team player and I want to distribute competencies in the executive committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
“And I’m going to give up hard tasks to move football a mile forward in each of these segments.”
“Many people’t be happy because they’d start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he would not be able to run again.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know that it’s going to make sense and that I won’t have people behind me constantly throwing my heels under my feet and questioning every step I take,” he explained.
“A lot of people told me I shouldn’t give up because others would give up.”
“That’s a confidence that I can’t just throw away,” he said.
He is also motivated by the continuation of the work he has begun with Haskell.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years and I don't want to throw it away now."
"Processes have been launched, which will take effect in a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with concerns that in the event of the election of another candidate Miroslav Pelty, the situation in the union could return to the time before the Hague.
“I believe in systematicity, and that’s something that I don’t think Mirek Pelta can do.”
“First of all, there are people behind him who would do football so that it would only be for those chosen.”
“You can blame me for a lot of things, but you can’t blame somebody.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just the chosen,” Rajchl said.
He also said he would be a Czech president.
“Al some people are trying to argue the opposite, I plan to do my best for Moravia.”
"For example, it is time to consider the division of the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would go to the first league."
"It would not be the current situation, when there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since the boss of the Plzeň club, Tomáš Paclík, also participated in the fight for president, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
“I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-president and sees that clear achievements are behind me,” said Rajchl, who considers the savings of tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, negotiation of television contracts and negotiations on the lottery law as his achievements.
In other words, the union does not pull for one rope.
While he claims that Pelt is "disqualified from returning confidence to Czech football", the second of his opponents, Paclík, is considered a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzni in that year."
"If he were elected, he would continue with the things that Ivan Hašek started here and would not fundamentally change the staff in the commissions."
"He't want to turn it in his favour," said Rajchl.

Upon the view of Ufona, the luxurious swimming pool in Budapest: Anyone travelling through Europe can experience its blue wonder - and after sightseeing or traveling let their tired feet rest in the thermal baths.
The book will show you where wellness is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on exploratory trips in the past year and a half, there was nothing missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Laying a sign on the water, she looked up to the artistically shaped domes, swam in front of the marble putti (figures of a little naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her on the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored secesion swimming pools.
If she liked some floating plant, she took it into her notebook, including remarkable details about how it was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by architectural historian Meder and are now presented in her recently published book "Badefreuden: People's swimming pools in Munich, historical swimming pools in Schwarzwald,"The Hard core of concrete structures" in Taunus.
Thirteen countries led by her “Travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe”: besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland – and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
With sports, it’s not too much, says Meder – just in water it’s something else.
The only thing to be angry about is that fan swimming has to be satisfied with the blue pebbles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can breathe the ominous smell of shrimp forests or listen to the cheering of birds in the park.
“One day I asked why the swimming pools must always be so ugly,” says Ms. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
“So I started collecting beautiful floats.”
Water level doubles architecture
Spotting in the jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - the factor of well-being is therefore so great that it affects all senses, so much Ms. Meder.
And when the founders tried, swimming pools can be a real pasture for the eyes: "Instead of the floor, a man has a water level in the baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: a high boiler, colorful stoves, jump boards.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden" provides, on 190 pages, everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical wellnes oases - but above all, it arouses the desire to jump into the blue.
The remarkable specimens were discovered by the collector of floats Ms. Meder during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful therapeutic baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Baths in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing water in the original kras cave (cave baths in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
In contrast, many open-air heated swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer a beautiful view. While you can see the whole city from the Zurich rooftop swimming pool, you can see the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton - and: In the steam baths there is a window from which you can watch the skiing traffic.
Per the most remarkable design of the pool awaits the spa guests in Längenfeld: Ötztal Aquapark looks like an UFO that just landed in the Alps.
From the three upper-open ponds in the winter, the steam rises, while in the background of the Ötztal mountain it rises to the sky.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool, Mrs. Meder’s swimming pool collector smelled chlorine.
Many thermal baths are felt after sulfur, in the Árpád Baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells of heating oil to such an extent that one can hardly believe that he got into therapeutic baths.
The smell comes from the alkaline-carbonated medicinal water, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool – a somewhat special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for nice baths: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic baths of Luhačovice, she stumbled on a closed terrain.
In 1902 the baths designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovič were closed.
When Ms. Meder looked through the falling windows of the red-white-yellow sectarian building, she saw how the weeds between the tiles grew greatly.
They opposed the disappearance at the magical swimming pool in Schwarzwald: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths have three stages of construction; one can discover not only the Neo-Roman elements, which date back to the time of their creation in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, which was annexed around 1900.
Since a careful modernization in 1995, Palais Thermal has been a favorite spa spot by swimming pool expert Iris Meder, not only because she comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's already some performance to combine such a variety of building structures into such a wonderful complex," says Ms. Meder.
In such a palace, immersion in a thermal pool is apparently a marginal matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank to check commodity trade
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank leaving its agricultural commodity trade?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the company will make a decision on the issue.
Hamburg -
For federal citizens, it is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn, according to one study.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from the deal as it deepens the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report released by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges is pushing prices up and banks are therefore complicit in the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, although big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also acting similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to insure traders against price fluctuations.
Meanwhile, most experts agree that capital market participants interested in high-risk trades have diverted themselves from supply and demand – and made profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism: He promised to review the complaints and said that no deal "is worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at stake".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the International Working Group is reviewing complaints from the Foodwatch-Report.
By the end of the year, the audit is to be closed, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors - along with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank will announce the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann works on his own image.
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but also intensified his criticism of the financial sector: “Stating on rising food prices shows drastically how carelessly banks are hurting the general well-being today.”
Let Ackermann as the top banking lobbyist perform his duties.
“Deutsche Bank must cut off all items from its portfolio that use money to bet on food prices,” Bode said.
"It is not clear whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with hungry people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s outlook appears to be surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before leaving the office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chief executive would not enter the supervisory board otherwise than planned.
By preventing controversial agricultural speculation, it could improve its image.
And he doesn’t have to worry about possible losses – he should eventually consult with his successor.
Investing in raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Approximately 11 percent of respondents believe it is legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments that involve betting on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw out personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: As a result of the survey, one in two would cancel all investments in which money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would warn their acquaintances against such a bank, 49 percent said they are considering closing their account and moving to another institution.
21st Century House in Vienna
Moving Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with highs, falls and happy ends: The Austrian pavilion from the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, left empty and deserted.
It is now being reopened as an exhibition house.
When heading for modern post-war architecture, bright shapes, glass halls, bold boom and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is a famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and high performance steel and glass construction.
The building is considered to be a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He celebrated the architect by also building an Austrian pavilion for the next world exhibitions.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW Palace plus as a key made by a side building in Munich, it eventually became internationally renowned in 1973.
The pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building after the World Exhibition, was placed in the Schweizer Garten near the Vienna Südbahnhof (Southern Station), renovated and in 1962 opened the Museum of the 20th century - it was named "House of the 20th century".
But the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging artistic exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art had a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has grown more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has renovated the pavilion, now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening there, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, opens its first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a prominent art historian with a prominent career, including in her youth as a cartoonist, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and as the founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modernity, pushed for strong reconstruction among politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsorship and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruby were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a cafe and bookstore were to be established, and an office building had to be built for this.
Strict control and low budget.
Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation.
Not only did he sensitively rebuild and expand Joseph Olbrich's sectarian buildings in Vienna and won the competition, but also because he studied at Schwanzer's Technical University Vienna and the pavilion was a "extremely important place" for him to visit exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which already lost its generosity and ease when it was moved to Vienna and changed its use.
During the current reconstruction, there were far greater problems: the building was "a catapult for energy," says Krischanitz.
The windows profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulation glass was used and the glass roof replaced with a special safety glass.
The cold bridges-steel beams were reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled ceilings repaired.
Two underground floors provided space for new uses, an enclosed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the elevated Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion red brown color.
The movie is exactly the same as it was before.
And all this under the strict supervision of the Monument Office and a low budget.
“Often, a material that was good and inexpensive had to be found and also liked by the Monument Office,” Krischanitz says, pointing to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
Difficult it was said to be with the pavilion, “which came here from Brussels,” Krischanitz said recently, a typical “drop-in-the-City-history.”
Such an architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place" and yet it wants to "build proper self-confidence".
In this case, however, the House of the 21st Century is not in the wrong place, as an urbanistic lucky coincidence has occurred: In the circle around Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed "City Quarter at the Main Station" with office and residential houses is created.
And maybe there will be another lucky coincidence: the 21st-century house could get support from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, is already negotiating with the city on neighborhood at a standing in Schweizer Garten.
Railway plans a million-dollar package for winter crisis
The railway has drawn up a crisis plan to prevent train shutdowns during the winter period.
The number of employees is doubled.
It will cost millions.
In the fight against winter-caused train shutdowns and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper "Bild" brought a preliminary report with reference to the internal corporate plan that it is said to count to 2015 with investments of around 300 million euros.
It is intended to improve the use of trains and railway networks even in extreme weather conditions.
It is planned, among other things, to double the number of internal and external staff to 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The goal is to get rid of the perimeter before the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary windshields over four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, railway chief Rüdiger Grube, after meeting at the highest level with government and industry officials, warned of train shutdowns and delays also during this winter.
In the past winter, the track had significant problems in passenger transport, because, among other things, it had a lack of reserves in difficult weather conditions.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Authority for years.
In addition, there is a delay in ICE trains.
The railway has also failed for years, and ICE trains must more often be checked when one of the ICE trains at the Cologne Main Station destroyed the axis.
Deutsche Bank to pay a million dollar fine in the U.S.
After the riots around chief Joseph Ackermann, there are new trampots in the United States: Deutsche Bank must pay millions of dollars in damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, the giant in the industry has yet to catch up with its past in the US: the Frankfurt institution pays in one settlement procedure $145 million (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgages.
The financial market regulator NCUA blames a number of large banks for seducing co-operative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they may have reduced the risks.
Such securities lost considerable value during the crisis and drove banks into the abyss.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the need to drag the parties to court," a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has pledged to pay out $20.5 million.
NCUA Chair Debbie Matz welcomed the welfare of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the U.S. and helps in bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
NCUA is seeking compensation for billions of dollars of damages.
Now completed settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also clung to other big banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
These are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble crashed in 2007, it became fatal to a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investment Bank Lehman Brothers changed its mindset.
Even though the events occurred a few years ago, a sharp wind is now blowing the banks in the face.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to remedy or punish the misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
He accuses 18 international big banks that two U.S. state-owned real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have disadvantaged $200 billion in mortgage deals.
Also, Deutsche Bank has to face the FHFA lawsuit, here it is more transactions worth a total of about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurt Institute be held accountable for "significant losses", without, however, specifying any precise amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Buffett is investing heavily in IBM.
Since March, it has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
American investor Warren Buffett has always said he will not invest in IT and computers because it is difficult to predict the long-term development of companies.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s business reports and has changed his mind on investing in the industry.
Much earlier he had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and purchases computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett’s investment is regarded in the financial world as passing on a knight.
As a result, it is now allowed to be called IBM's mother rock of IT "Sir IBM".
Buffett told CNBC that he had bought $10.7 billion of IBM shares since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a stake of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM did not know anything about his engagement.
He praised the management, which sought even proper returns during the economic crisis.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long been betting on lucrative IT services such as operating computing centers.
The 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consultancy as well as powerful computers for.
Buffett has avoided technological companies so far.
He claims to invest only in companies whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached the freight railway, the lubricant manufacturer, or the machinery manufacturer.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, formerly Municher Rück.
The 81-year-old took over Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it one of the most valuable in the world.
His way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money gave him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha" (Miracle of Omaha).
When Buffett’s investment became known, IBM shares rose by one percent before the opening of the stock exchange.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, has a total stock market value of more than $220 billion and is considered, along with Apple and Microsoft, the most valuable technology enterprises in the world.
At Microsoft, so many Buffett would not want to appear.
Bill Gates is said to be his close friend.
The threat is tangible.
Following the disclosure of the "Cell in Zwickau", Turkish media is questioning the German rule of law.
The newspaper even talks about a “bloody ideology” that is now reviving.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report was reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For for many German Turks, this brings back a ghost that has long been considered dead: since the burning attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany has never been a doubt.
The discovery of the right-wing extremist network, however, reveals a scale whose dimensions can no longer be seen.
“Is the bloody ideology reviving?” the headlines of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was a secret police agent of the constitutional protection department and fears that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical meltdown.
The Turkish municipality in Germany reacted boldly: It commemorated the weekend with a silence demonstration in front of the Brandenburg Gate of victims of racist violence.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In joyful colours, the joint life was staged - as a success story.
As a box here acts the news of several Turkish media: "Giving Germany to the Fifty" is the headline of the article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Even the publication of the newspaper "Hürriyet" for Germany cannot be taken in order not to carry out this thought-connection.
“It’s starting to smell,” is the title of the column by Ahmeta Külahci.
He emphasizes that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the rebuilding of Germany were murdered.
The most critically discussed in German-Turkish internet forums is the police’s procedure and its late success in the search.
Why did the German authorities not think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
So many are at least rhetorically prepared to use drastic means: “If the activity here continues to be carried out so superficially, the immigrants will have nothing but their own defense and arms.”
“This is the best self-defense.”
"On the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the punishment of the entire network very strongly depends on the internal peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means if internal peace in Germany is threatened, they clarify the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the Solingen burn-up is deeply imprinted in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
For no other event has made it clearer to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
However, the attacks made the Turks feel more reciprocal.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press criticised the failure of German politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the fire in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish state president, but let himself be represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel at a mourning ceremony in Cologne - Kinkel then in his speech calculated what fees the Turkish people were paying.
It is as if the value of a man is measured by the amount of his taxes.
Current Turkish media reports show once again how deeply many German Turks lack confidence in the country’s state legal system.
Alongside efforts to clarify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandal at the Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not headquartered in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered almost bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has been sliding from one crisis to the next ever since.
A German has to compare it.
Axel Weber did not think so.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that he would enter a equally spectacular new job in 2013: chairman of the board of directors of the Swiss big bank UBS – an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber rejoiced in public, praising Switzerland either for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and saying friendly remarks to future colleagues.
“Die UBS has made a turn.”
“I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.”
But in September, it was clear that everything was going to be different.
A dealer at UBS in London bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and wasted approximately €1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, not only a Swiss-recognised banker, was forced to resign.
The UBS board chairman has since been like a slump — and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And the chairmanship of the board of directors will take over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It will be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and an emission banker and would need time to work.
He will then take over the responsibility for the strategy of the bank, which just once again proved to deserve the title of "Banque des plus grands scandales en Europe".
Because UBS is enormous – until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager – and has been moving from one scandal to the next for years.
There is nothing, so it seems, that the proud Swiss bank will not be saved.
It started with the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS an excellent reputation.
The image of a silent and solid, but also clever asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, it has progressed as an investment bank into the league of the world’s largest banks.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a long-time professor of banking in Zurich, says: “I always presented UBS as a good banking model to my students at the time.”
From today’s perspective, one asks, “How could I have been so wrong?”
He was greatly mistaken.
In 2007, it was clear for the first time that something was going wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, the chairman of the board of directors, Peter Wuffli, surprisingly resigned, who was so far considered a highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker.
A few months later, he understood why he left.
The bank’s investment division wasted subprime securities and had to write down billions.
UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
In fact, she has found investors, but those over whom she would have recently held her nose: the opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one could not even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
It was worse in 2008.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, 2006 still the second highest-paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, a catastrophe followed: UBS stood behind the financial crisis before collapse due to its faulty investments and had to be saved by the state.
The Nationalbank purchased tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, while the Swiss Confederation paid six billion francs for obligatory bonds for which she could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - for it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet sum of UBS 2007 was more than five times greater than the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
“Once again, we couldn’t save UBS,” says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and showed a willingness to release data of wealthy customers who, if possible, with the help of banks, cut taxes.
In addition, it agreed to pay $780 million – as a return of unjustified profits from these deals, including a fine surcharge.
Thus, UBS more or less openly acknowledged that it helped reduce taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for wealthy clients: the sacrament of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what it used to be.
It was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board and the chairman of the board.
Exodus of customer money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility over the course of several months in both core business areas: in investment banking due to bad speculation and in asset management to help reduce taxes.
And just as it got slightly quiet, just as it was thought that UBS had recovered, this unfortunate business base comes up: A single dealer wasted €1.7 billion before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it’s clear: with risk management in investment banking, it’s still unlikely.
“In the case of Adoboli, we’ve probably found that risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
Also the chief financial officer of a large German bank is sure: “The problem with UBS is that it fails to control risks.”
But it was precisely the idea of precaution with which Swiss bankers walked out a long time ago to become the guardians of the world’s great wealth: no too great risks, but security for money – also from this side of the Alpine Republic the world collapsed.
Swiss bank treasures have become a symbol of unshakable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for especially high-quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits into the cliché of a good Swiss private bank – it’s just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry stores like Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional stores such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries, Swiss banks have been located here: from the Nationalbank through the Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is entered by a heavy rotating door.
Inside are walls paved with marble, in front of them stands a huge leather chair, next to the logo of the bank a large guide to the "safe".
UBS knows what customers are looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank was sometimes suppressed or betrayed by both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of one small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspapers, and eventually, like all Swiss bankers, he also concludes deals with both big banks.
UBS has probably grown too much, it finds – especially in investment banking, where Anglosas have also spread.
The Swedes have nothing to say about it.
“And if they did, they’d adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways.”
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, bringing it first high profits and then disaster: No European financial institution has lost in the jungle around Subprime as much money as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was evident.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven-million-dollar country decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euros, were approved by politicians to save the bankrupt big bank.
How could this have happened?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you see the problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss banks merged into a massive corporation.
A bank was created that was already too big for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger – and continued to grow.
In doing so, it helped to complement the two different banking predecessors of UBS: One wealthy but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on asset management and a poorer but more internationally involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came advantageously to a lot of money with which they could spin a big roulette.
With this rise of UBS are connected two names: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS Group from 2001 to 2007 and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I’ve always thought Wuffli and Ospel are the team of the future,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the man who controls the feelings around his stomach, who has developed himself from banking science to the top."
But Ospel said he relied on Wuffli to the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: “He probably thought his models were reality,” says Geiger.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic maybe.
Pride precedes fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive rallies at which CEO Wuffli repeated the same slogan over and over again: Destroy Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The Bank of America was the world’s most powerful investment bank.
She listed the "League Tables", a ranking that documented the success of banks of that time.
UBS is in the top position.
A few steps have already been taken.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade, the game was participating completely on top.
Business advisors who have been commissioned, however, emphasize one weakness: In international interest trading, in the “Fixed Income” banker’s speech, there’s probably a big gap behind the biggest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and its venture capital fund have invested in U.S. subprime investments.
It developed into a powerful machine that packaged securities into American mortgage loans and handed them over – but also retained the risks.
Other banks have long been looking for a solution.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, there UBS bought," says banking expert Geiger.
How great is the euphoria, so deep is the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were harder than thought.
Positions at UBS have become a catapult seat and are humping up to this day.
Whoever runs a big bank now has almost an unmanageable job.
They have to find a strategy for the bank that all close business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger has an idea: End investment banking, concentrate on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
So far the bank does not want to go.
But the investment banking sector is going to decline strongly, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was actually understood only as a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with its predecessor, Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has pushed forward: He has long-term operations with UBS, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state in the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats are cut.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is her?
What does he want to earn money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
He says he will find his first apartment with his wife in Zurich.
next year.

Europe is not likely to recover from the recession so quickly, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
Investment legend Warren Buffett just confirmed this outlook: He said in one CNBC-interview that it will probably not yet be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.

Smart vapors are spreading in cities
In many places, field squirrels are considered "problematic birds": however, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from cities, experts say.
Some love them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Vranes have been part of the image of the city for centuries, yet in some villages there are complaints of residents about dirt and noise caused by animals.
So far, there is no “problem birds” in the field.
The crabs of the field may not be removed from the cities anymore, experts said at the first symposium on crabs in Leer, East Africa.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible outputs.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Nature defenders also derived the problems of cities from the exodus of protected field havens: the use of chemicals in agriculture is probably increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
Pursuit, growing plantation and cutting typical trees to nest birds make life difficult.
Vans are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are among others in Westphalia’s Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
There, a 2005 controversial project of mass killing vapors in a rural district provoked negative headlines.
Critics have described catching animals in bird traps and slaughtering birds as brutal.
"Normal expulsion, frightening, does not bring anything," so much discovered urbanist and landscape designer Werner Klöver of Leer.
Removing the nest by spraying water or cutting trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals retreat, large colonies split and divided into other places.”
Scare can only be thought of as an exception for hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we will not get them away.”
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
It is possible to think of a combination of expelling animals from sensitive areas and attracting them to settle in other places.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens promoted "information boards instead of chain piles" because of a completely different treatment of animals: "One cucumbers in the face can best end up with self-confidence."
Ms. Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascherberg Scientific Wrecking Trail, on which information boards provide lessons about the life of a highly intelligent field shrimp.
It is said that the project is already accepted by tourists.
Also on criticism of the noise caused by birds, Ms. Jürgens had her own opinion: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Field Hawks do not only use a tool to reach a puppet, but even make their instrument as a tool.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior of four field shrimp to see how far the birds reached their intelligence.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones had to bring about the collapse of the structure in order to reach the larvae of the mole.
Without much training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the smarter vultures had to solve a more complicated problem.
In the vertically built cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with a larva mola.
The birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers placed pieces of wire there.
Of these, all four animals formed a hook, with which they caught from the tube a container for a hold.
Three out of the four fields of havrans even managed to do so with a stake.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for the cup did not come out.
Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the last tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by the twice-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8,53), Portugal defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made its fifth consecutive participation in the European Championship perfect after the score of 0:0 in the first match.
The Czechs had enough in retaliation Play-off with outsider Montenegro score 1:0 (0:0), when the first match was a clear thing.
Croatia did not score the goal with 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland achieved a relaxed 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) scored other goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional from the Bundesliga Zvjezdan Misimovic converted a penalty (41) and captain Emir Spahic (65) reduced twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia disappointed Portugal in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made a peaceful start.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 meters into the net.
A good quarter-hour later, Nani demonstrated his qualities in shooting on a long distance and adjusted the goal from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not act in the first half-hour, had their first clear chance in goalkeeper Edina Dzekova.
The former player Wolfsburg of the English head of the table club Manchester City placed the ball on the bottom edge of the ribbon with the head, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
In the end, he stood in the center of the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
After the intervention against Helder Postig in the Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card.
On the counterpart, Stark performed a controversial penalty kick after the action of Fabio Coentraa, which Misimovic confidently transformed.
But after the break, the European vice champion of 2004 clarified everything with four goals.
Petr Jiracek also ended the final doubts for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth consecutive European championship in 1976.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilk with Bundesliga legionaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second already in the initial phase.
The goalkeeper Petr Čech prevented reflexively in the last moment possible own goalkeeper Tomás Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from a turn from the border of the criminal territory just around Čechova’s goal.
After the break, the cross barrel had to save the place of the already slaughtered goalkeeper of the world class Czechs, again reduced the attacker FC Soul (50).
Shortly before the end, everything was clear.
Turkey missed the football miracle from Zagreb at that moment.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not exceed 0:0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost confidently has to relieve his place on the bench of third at the 2002 World Cup, the Croats can rejoice in their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir’s Stadium, the Turks should experience almost a fairy-tale start.
Selcuk Inan hit in the seventh minute with a distance shot only a bar, the attacker Kazim also could not hang the defeated ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, Croatia, however, continued to take control.
The Croatians also did not get a goal after the break.
Besides Mario Mandzukice of VfL Wolfsburg, who released Dortmund Ivan Perisice from the 62nd minute, were in action legionaries from the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
It was Ireland’s first participation in the European Championship since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who took care of the success of 4:0 in the first match already about the preliminary decision, in the 32nd minute to lead.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) was the final player for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only in the last minute the Estonian defense prevented a possible leading goal.
In the 32nd minute, it was a long way away.
After the unsuccessful defense of goalkeeper Paul Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball across the line to the status of 1:0.

Massacre on a Personal Level
Peter Englund’s emotional new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with such a long list of outstanding characters as to turn your head out of it.
One advice to keep up at the moment: Carefully remove this page and make it a bookmark.
With all the people you will be very well acquainted in Mr. Englund’s novel narrative and this list will serve as a navigation – like a kind of beacon – in the moments when, like the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a member of the Swedish Academy, which is awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual – the author himself describes it, quite accurately, as “anti-historical work.”
It contains several very well-known names, important contracts and famous battles, but it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and tactics and equipment discussions.
It’s not a book about what happened, the author explains, but rather “a book about what it was.”
"Beauty and Sorrow" combines the war experiences of 20 more and fewer men and women on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, emergency drivers and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others will become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives are flaming like the flames of candles lit in the church – new ones are added to the plot of fate, while others are extinguished.
The book of Mr. Englund differs from classical historical novels.
It modifies the notion that the First World War was only about horrendous canyon battles on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve the problems of falling bee nests on them, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids, or struggling with the presence of tse-tse flies.
It was a very exciting reading from the beginning.
War will sweep people’s lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smells like gun dust.
When the shooting starts in the distance and you are the woman who is at home with her children, will you run away or stay?
Who is actually approaching?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why the whole war was unleashed.
“The vacuum created by the lack of facts,” noted Mr. Englund, “was filled with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are taken from biographies, letters and other materials already published.
The descriptions of their lives may sound frightening and engaging, but thanks to the incorporation of tiny moments and details they are absolutely vivid and credible.
Many of them talk about suffering and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "The victims, the substitutes everywhere."
"Coffee imitation, aluminum imitation, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "meat made from pressed rice cooked in sheep fat (and supplemented with fake bone from wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes with wooden pants".
It mentions that there were “837 registered meat substitutes in the production of strawberries and 511 registered coffee substitutes.”
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American finds in himself an inner urge to be wild and brutal, and declares about war, “You will finally understand that this is human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whisky, evening newspapers or a good book and pretend that this mask represents civilization and that there is no barbaric behind that scratched self.”
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely soon die, and no one will notice it, let alone to mourn.
“When one finally accepts to sacrifice, he would at least expect it to happen in front of the eyes of a grateful audience,” he writes.
Instead, he feels like a “condemned man who is secretly hanged.”
Other notes relate to the departure of the old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
“The conflict became increasingly economic competition and competitive struggle,” writes Mr. Englund, “war between factories.”
He captured what he calls “a new kind of beast of the coming century: a pronounced and ideologically sworn mass murderer in custom-cut clothes, who performs his bloodshed without rising from the table.”
People behave completely unexpectedly, madness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a sexual illness from prostitutes in order to avoid service on the front.
“The most grotesque example of this behavior was the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers bought and sprayed on their genitals in the hope that it would end up in the hospital,” he writes.
“The most desperate people wiped it in their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives.”
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s prose is quick, but not spectacular, which fits greatly to his human theme.
In dozens of small outputs, he captures the way in which the war “disrupted absolutely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about the First World War mostly worked with hints rather than complex storytelling, such as "The First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels such as "On the Western Front Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers unconventional concepts.
His book has the most overwhelming endings that has no precedent in popular science literature.
I will not reveal it to you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, pulled a page from your list of heroes from your hand and set it on fire.
After the previous mistake, this time for a minute exactly scheduled.
Hundreds of police officers participated, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because at that time the Zuccotti Park would be almost empty.
No one knew about the action except a few senior officers.The others were first told that it was an exercise.
The action was led by police commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
Cases of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against demonstrators, which violated the rules of the department, were not allowed to repeat, and a wave of public sympathy was spread to the side of the squatters.
Therefore, the police operation, aimed at clearing the Zuccotti Park from the demonstrators, was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and exercises.
Leaders were inspired by operations in other cities.
A massive exercise for case-of-crisis behavior took place in a part of Randalls Island that was preparing for an event in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have intensified the so-called riot suppression training – counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid move of a large number of police officers – with a focus on the Lower Manhattan area.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally “at the last moment” stated by someone to whom the action was originally explained only as “exercise”.
“I know a few police officers who were also called to this action, and definitely no one told them that they were going to the Zuccotti Park,” said the person who spoke only on the condition that he remained anonymous.
"Only the highest-ranking members of the department knew about going to the Zuccotti Park."
One of the reasons for secrecy was a lesson the city had already received.
On October 14, officials in the city planned to clean the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, hundreds of them entered the park before the operation began.
Tuesday’s action was attended by police from various units, including intervention groups from around the area – dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that a large number of people come and leave the park during the day, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when there would be as few people in the park as possible," he said.
Before the units departed, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplifiers ran to the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and recorded news bursting from the amplitudes scared many demonstrators.
When law enforcement troops entered the park in their blue windshields, many demonstrators packed up their things and left.
Police say they didn’t touch a tent until 1:45 in the morning, giving protesters time to pack their bags.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering on the edge of the park in order to break into it if any arrests were needed.
Journalists were forced to leave the park.
Police chief spokesman Paul J. Browne said it was for their safety.
Many journalists, however, have argued that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing their units in action, and that some police officers were rude toward them.
Mr. Browne argued that the TV cars on Church Street leading along the western border of the park could shoot without problems.
Police proceeded westward and wrapped up with a thick confusion of the protesters’ personal belongings, including luggage and igelit bags full of clothes.
Some of the protesters who refused to move were pulled out of the park. Documentary footage appeared on the Internet a moment later.
The most agitated group of protesters took refuge near the kitchen in their camp, which was located near the center of the park.
Some of them set up barricades and the police started their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the camp attached to each other.
And two people were tied to the tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to remove the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 in the morning, Mr. Kelly said.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were due to "organizing riots and resistance during arrests," he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, commander of the police department, the highest-ranked uniformed officer on the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the detective commander at the department, was also personally involved in the operation.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "was not involved in managing the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they needed to be called.
Barriers were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park.
From these places, the police then expanded the seat belt even further from the Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers, many of whom were equipped with shields, were seen pushing people further beyond that border.
There were 28 people on the border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around five o’clock in the morning, one demonstrator south of Pine Street was seen jumping out on the hood of a police car, and several others dropping air from the tyres of a police truck.
In a moment, a piece of the crowd flew out.
At the end of the operation, one policeman and one demonstrator were hospitalized.
Trade Union Assistant Workers will sued the city for dismissal
Trade unions representing hundreds of school aid workers who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the dismissal was not necessary and was discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on the schools attended by poor students.
A court ruling is probably the last option left to unions in the District Council 37 area in their quest to reverse the dismissal decision.
On October 7th, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s worst-paid employees lost their jobs.Their dismissal was described by trade union leaders as retaliation for the city’s refusal to access the workforce-managed health care fund last spring, which the city wanted to use to clog a budget hole.
The city officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At a city council meeting last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissal was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the council immediately countered by not speaking specifically about the dismissal of aid workers in the budget.
District Council 37 officials announced that they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him.On Wednesday, they will hold a press conference to formally announce the lawsuit to the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the plaintiff will be eight dismissed workers, all of whom are African Americans or Hispanics, as well as most other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit and would therefore not comment on the individual charges.
According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the trade unions targeted the number of dismissed in the poor parts of the city, thereby supporting their claims of unfair conduct.
They point out that while schools in Staten Island were not allowed at all and in Upper East Side only a minimum, 17 school assistants were dismissed in Brooklyn, District 23 in Brownsville, and 46 assistants were dismissed in District 8 and 9 in the Southern Bronx.
He recalls that at Harlem’s Public School 36 five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, despite being a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: “This is not a neighborhood full of mobile parents who can raise funds to offset the budget deficit.”
The Public School 36 budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated bonus funding for each enrolled poor student.
The unions, among other things, argue that high school directors may have been confused by the way a document approving the dismissal of parental coordinators was written.
The document used the word “excess” to describe the action, i.e. to cancel a position, although this word is more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school payroll to a database of available staff whose salary is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators were fired," the draft complaint reads, "and not just moved to the database for the position of available workers."
Congress ready to agree on the situation in Libya
At last, Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
Before that, however, the revolution had to succeed, the long-running dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of U.S. troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate’s Committee on International Relations will decide on a statement backed by President John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which he should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and thank the American troops for their “courage.”
“With this statement, we want to recognize the courage of the people of Libya who have begun the reconstruction of their country,” Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic efforts."
These sentences may seem innocent, but no debate about Libya has so far been easy.
Over the course of the summer, lawmakers from both sides have been constantly arguing with each other and the White House about the wording of a series of statements to approve or reject the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution allowing a limited use of U.S. forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House due to differences in views between the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, the same day that the proposal was rejected in the House, the House also rejected measures that would halt the funding of U.S. operations in Libya.
This put the U.S. mission in Libya literally in a legislative purge – Congress has criticized the way President Obama manages the mission, but its members were obviously not so irritated to stop supporting him in his actions.
The congress’s hesitation was eventually preceded by other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and killed Gaddafi on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to negotiate.
The Commission on International Relations, in its statement, “blessed the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable perseverance in their efforts to liberate their people” and “blessed the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their allies who participated in the operation to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The statement also “reaffirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new proposal get the full support of the Commission on International Relations, or will the legislators again be split into two halves, as was the case when the June proposal was approved?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (India), the main representative of the Republican Party in the commission.
Lugar’s spokesman said on Monday he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution relating to the budget or any other topic that will be voted on by the entire House or Senate.
Other lawmakers, despite considerable efforts, have not yet managed to push their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt’s proposal is just one of the 68 amendments to the constitution that were introduced at Congress and touched a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same – the same proposal submitted to both the House and the Senate – and others are only minor changes to others.
Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of the amendment on the balanced budget and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters—especially novice Republicans who want to improve their reputation—can boast of their “authorship.”
The decree on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on the amendment concerning the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration in support of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss limits on the number of terms in which members of Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (NY) wants to increase the number of terms that members of Congress can serve as president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a range of additions that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage and the amendment prohibiting the burning of the national flag remain permanent proposals.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although members of Congress appear to be very active in proposing various amendments, they are not significantly out of average compared to previous years.
They offered 77 amendments in the 111th Congress, while in the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even fades compared to the early 1990s, when, according to statistics from the Senate Library, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than the current politicians.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th amendment - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
“Bite but not defeated,” says Gifford in her first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after she was injured by a gunshot in a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, singing alongside a song from the broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and declaring that more than returning to Congress was about recovering.
Giffords appeared in the "20/20" show on ABC News with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that making sentences still made her trouble and she needed help while walking.
The whole show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary because of the injury caused by a bullet that broke her skull in the front, penetrated her left half of the brain and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate in a triumphant vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since a January shooting that killed six people and wounded 13 others, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — describing her recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Giffords, 41, replied, “Too well.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hourly special episode of the show "20/20", which was broadcast on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, entitled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special monitored Gifford’s entire recovery since the January 8 shooting.
On videos that Kelly filmed during the first few weeks, Giffords is seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scarring across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can’t do more at that time than just raise one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and therapists teach her how to perform simple activities.
Pulling the head.
Exfoliating the lips.
And then, her first word: “What.”
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast" when she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a key role in Giffords' recovery: Congressman singing alongside a therapist to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During an interview, Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, told Sawyer that she couldn’t remember anything from the day the shooting occurred.
Her husband said Gifford had read the newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six were who were killed in the incident.
The suspect is Jared Lee Loughner, who is detained in a prison in Missouri, where he awaits trial under the influence of forcibly administered drugs.
“A lot of people have died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
“Terrible, Terrible and Terrible.”
He told Kelly Sawyer that at one point during his recovery, his wife said, “I lost.”
"So I told her right away, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
“You just got a cover.
But you’ll do it, you’ll get together and you’ll come back stronger than ever before.”
Military units meet with compassion rather than respect
That event was a gala evening on Wall Street that brought millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who have no roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
There were hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him.
The crowd dressed up and applauded enthusiastically.
“Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the Spring Benefit.
The ceremony was attended by the then chairman of the chief of staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, who, however, saw the role of military units somewhat differently.
“They were all presented as orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I think the organizers thought well.
I know yes.
But what I saw was no respect, it was regret.
Thus, the opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the often-measured, sometimes glorifying American public.
The army is unquestionably covered with praise for its victims.
But it costs a lot, the soldiers say.
The public is acting more and more as if they regret the individual in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive for military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or ruin relationships with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by troops once returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are pronounced in silence and in privacy among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Canciano returned from combat activities where they served as marines, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at their service from two angles.
From the point of view of some will feel respect and amazement, as they defeated enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
Others will be pushing their heads if “an evil, violent veteran does not hide under the surface,” said Cancian, who participated in the fighting in Iraq and after returning to Washington took a seat in the government.
He argued that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him were discreetly suggesting whether he could withstand the stress associated with working in Washington so soon after returning from fighting.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
The army’s concern is partly due to American indifference to wars.
Successes on the battlefield rarely get recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army and finds little self-benefit in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it used to be during World War II,” said Lieutenant-General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are honored for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to struggle against rape
This week, it will decide whether a trial of 28 women and men against the military will be opened for alleged inaction in a rape case.
If not, hundreds of other applicants are ready to file a lawsuit.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old on the night she was allegedly raped by her military colleague and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she stumbled upon her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her in order to have a drink at her room.
“There was a warning light in my head,” Lyman described.
But the Texas native completely ignored her objections.
I thought, “No, he’s 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
“I wish I listened to my instincts.”
She claims that just a few minutes after they entered her room, a man went over to her, threw her to bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the army will wait for the verdict of a hearing that could have a historic impact.This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will get before the court.
The charges state that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to fight the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charges were filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke and the plaintiff had 17 members at the time, but in the following months their number grew to 28-25 women and three men, all claiming that they had been raped or sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and that the army failed to investigate, punish and pursue justice after reporting these attacks.
Burke argues that she goes to the neck of the top army commanders, because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a directive system,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position that can prevent attempts to take action against such acts?
Burke also says she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of further lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the accusations into this case — putting all the eggs in one basket, as she says — she will file lawsuits in multiple different cases if needed to keep the pressure out.
The defence team is headed by U.S. Attorney General Neil MacBride, who together with his colleagues filed an initiative to reject the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy — basically, it’s that current or former soldiers can’t sue the army for injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court order called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the plaintiffs," the document said.
The Defense Ministry refused to comment on the matter.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially prohibited from serving in battle, it’s just a word-of-word: in modern wars, it’s hard to find a clear frontline.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, female troops played an increasingly significant role, in communicating with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers died between these wars - two-thirds of them directly in battle.
It is time for modernization in the army, Burke explains.
She is not alone in her battle.In addition to her, three other lawyers are dealing with the case.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a veteran legal service seminar are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly developing an atmosphere promoting hatred for women.
Independently, the non-profit organization of American Vietnamese veterans is gathering evidence for its lawsuit against the army. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of a "personality disorder" allegedly detected in rape victims so that the army has a pretext to release them - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, who belongs to the Human Rights Fighters Group Service Women's Action Network, this is a completely common practice.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the state organization for negotiating with veterans, which it accuses of discriminatory practices that should have occurred in the processing of requests for assistance from individuals who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in Congress by a group of senators and deputies from both political parties and proposed a range of corrective measures.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Control of Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defense, 3,158 sexual assaults were in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to Pentagon’s own estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in a given year.
A report released in March also deals with the rate of prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases in the military were brought to court — half the civil justice system.
Prosecutors in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks only as the first of a series of traumas.
First-class soldier Lyman, for example, the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to occur.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape eleven times to various police members, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape and in her bed was found the blood of the assailant - from the wound she had done to his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing during which she was asked whether she had sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify in favour of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted of guilt.
“I remember the day the verdict was issued,” Lyman says.
“I felt like I was going to give birth right there – I ran out of the courtroom with a scream.”
"They placed me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, 'That wasn't his judgment.
Lyman were ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, thus declaring her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and therefore without entitlement to service.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other prosecutors moves into the next phase or not, it’s a long run, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington Law University.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to move on to further stages of negotiation."
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the doctrine mentioned, which has been criticized since the first moment it saw the light of the world.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is several decades behind, because their duties do not allow them to observe the same level of motivational stimuli and deterrent.
He adds: “The odds are hard against them... but it’s important for them to try.”
Change will only happen if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not decide in their favor, Burkevoá, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will gather hundreds of other persons ready to file a lawsuit and start working on other cases related to the subject.
"We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue, from where there will be no reform," he said.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Examine You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murderous rage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was definitely not alone in the cyber space: he spent a lot of time at the computer while preparing for the attack, chatting with some of the millions of right-wing nationalists on social media pages.
After the tragedy this summer, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
It’s easy – just go to Facebook.
“We realized that getting them isn’t really that hard at all,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by the British research team on European digital populism.
The stockpile of personal information on Facebook is so vast, Bartlett says, that it was enough for researchers to simply take advantage of advertising on sites to determine the demographic group they were looking for with absolute accuracy – something marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team across Europe found half a million right-wing fans, and then focused their attention on them and sent them ads. But instead of inviting them to a newly formed group or offering them some dietary products, they asked them to fill out a questionnaire with questions about their level of education, their attitude to violence and their optimism about their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans from 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries – without having to leave the office at all.
“It’s an entirely new way of conducting research,” notes Bartlett.
Some of the findings are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are all young men, who are upset by the growing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen.”
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of researchers.
Research teams, health scientists and policy researchers use this site to study everything from health issues to social trends hidden by status updates, posts on the walls, and “Like” buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them daily on average provides three different data, making this social network literally a "information supernova", which is worth the development of many new research. The number of academic papers in whose name the word Facebook appears has increased from the state five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook lies in giving them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"In the past it was true that when you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You’d have to get into a party where you’d never be allowed,” says Bartlett.
“This is all Facebook breaks down – you just go straight to them.”
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a social-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who dismantled their drunk-outs on Facebook were much more at risk of a problem of alcoholism than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moren suggests that peers of students monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunk status.
“The problem cannot be solved unless you can diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children that we would otherwise have no chance of discovering."
Facebook is constantly scanning the data of its users.
The site’s information team compiled statistics on the relationship status and Valentine’s Day, 2010 election participation, and the nation’s satisfaction rate (mainly using the information they had access to – supporters of internet freedom have long argued that the site should make its information treasure available for research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is being tracked, whether they like it or not – in exchange for playing Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, they need to provide the site with their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don’t even know about?
Researchers have clearly defined rules on how to collect data offline, but online data is accessible to everyone.
“I think most users didn’t even think that researchers could look into their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using public Facebook walls of his students.
"When it came to them, they took it as if there was only information between them and their friends."
The question of methodology should also be considered.
Even with offline research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is not possible to verify how much of the information on the profile and posts on the wall are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn explains.
That’s why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, thinks that a pencil and a notebook are still the best possible tools to use in research.
“When you go into the real world and talk to real people, it’s something that can’t be replaced,” he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and damn a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line."
"Cold and Inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being responsible for the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter of “resistance” during his first public hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among the Norwegian Templar Knights," he said before a court meeting of 500 people.
“I object to the Court because you are mandated by organizations that promote the ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism.”
“I acknowledge my actions, but I do not acknowledge any guilt.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik an opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could speak his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a prepared speech with him, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from any contact with the media for four months, and announced that the authorities would have full control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of the victims and survivors attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to look Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure he is held firmly under the lock.
Everyone was involved to move the case to an immediate closure.
“I thought he looked cold and inhumane,” one of the survivors told NRK.
"It wasn't pleasant, but for myself I can say that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I mentally moved a little further."
Breivik, wearing a dark costume and a blue tie, remained quiet and professional throughout the hearing.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre idea of being part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge admitted he wasn’t crazy, noting that there was no evidence he had any complicit.
For some it may be a consolation that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically diminish the sorrow and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
“I wish she had fallen out like a monster, but that’s not the case,” one of the victims’ relatives said.
If it were, everything would be much easier.”
7 Lessons From Lost Interview With Steve Jobs in Movie Going To Theaters This Week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5, people began to compare him to Henry Ford - and elected him for his genius as the greatest modern inventor.
On Jobs’s recently rediscovered interview, which was dusted for a special film coming to theaters this week, it will be for all Apple fans the fact that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedant organizer and a man who fits every little thing into the smallest details - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work ... [but] there is still a long way between a great idea and a great resulting product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumph of Computer Fools, which discussed the dawn of personal computers.
At that time, it was ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had full hands of work with his new computer company NeXT, and was eager to see how the general public adopted the internet.
In the TV show, only a short portion of Cringely’s entire interview was eventually used, and the original copies of the interview were said to have been lost during the transportation.
Shortly after Jobs’s death, however, VHS copies were found in the director’s garage.
It is this material, slightly cut down, that forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: Lost Interview, which goes to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who has become famous for his reluctance to provide longer conversations, Jobs is surprisingly excited to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
He is also a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the conversation, there is a longer pause between the question and the answer – 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, when you can see how Jobs perfectly thinks about the answer to be as accurate and accurate as possible.
There are moments when Jobs’ perfectionism flows to the surface, when he is impatient with Cringely’s questions and prompts him to get to more important issues and topics faster.
The interview was shot before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and fearsome prophetic thoughts appear in it as Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing well and badly, while offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It’s one thing to read post-mortem reviews of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about Jobs, who we see here as an eager dreamer in the blossom of his genius.
It has its own vision of how things could and should look.
It didn’t take long, and after he had expressed his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from Lost Interview that are definitely worth noting:
Learn how to run a business:
“Over the years I’ve been doing business, I’ve always asked myself, ‘Why are you doing this?’ and the answer was always the same: ‘Well, this is how it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, he never thinks about business-related things in depth.
I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his effort to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused about the way the costs were recorded – they often started with the inscription “standard costs”, about their amount he could only guess. At that moment he decided to go his own way – he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the trading costs within a moment.
How he made a roast to the Pope:
Jobs recalls the “Blue Box” he built with Steve Wozniak – a device that enabled people to effectively break into a telephone company and make free calls anywhere in the world.
A lot has been written about the device in the past, but Jobs’s enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as a tool of power is literally contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested their devices using a paid phone and let them switch from one AT&T network to another during a call while using as many satellites as possible.
“At least half a dozen times we’ve been around the world like this, so when we shouted something on a paid phone, it came a minute later from the other phone at the door,” Jobs laughs.
“We were young and we found that we can build something that is capable of controlling billions of dollars’ infrastructure around the world.”
We both made a small thing that could control a much bigger giant – it was an incredible experience and I think Apple would never have been created without it.
Jobs continues to describe the joke that they and Wozniak had almost completed.Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, making up Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Gradually, higher-ranking members of the Catholic Church were called to talk to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they woke up the Pope, the couple cried out and laid their headphones.
How he fell in love with technology (and called Bill Hewlett):
When he was twelve and sought spare parts to build a kilometer, he found Bill Hewett’s number on his phone list and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had already secured a summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what such a company is and how it should behave to its employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the company’s research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, had a CRT monitor and I instantly fell in love with it.
As a teenager, I progressed higher and higher at HP, popping around that computer and starting to write programs for it.
How to Innovate:
In several places during the interview, Jobs talks about how he is inventing new products on the run.
At the beginning of his career, when he went to sell a couple of desks, one customer asked him to assemble a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems faced when developing computer mice:
"I remember how we were quite wildly arguing... they screamed at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] before it stopped fun for me, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How large companies breathe:
Long before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs prophesied that many industry leaders in their vision would collapse and lose their market share.
“Let’s say you’re working for IBM or Xerox, so you’re making better copying machines or printers, well, what next?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be a more successful company.
At that point, sales and marketing are ruling, so companies are headed by people who are in charge of this, while people in charge of their own products are removed from the decision-making process.
The technological genius that brought the company to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
This is what happened to Xerox.
Xerox could have owned literally the entire computer industry.
It could be ten times bigger than it is, it could be Microsoft of the 1990s...
Instead of winning, they lost.
Innovation as a form of art.
“Between a great idea and a great product there is still a long way to go and a lot of work ... and as that great idea develops, it changes and grows.”
During that time you will learn a lot about it.
You have to go on to a range of compromises – certain things just electrons, glass, robots, or factories do you don’t force.
You have to keep 5000 things in mind – different concepts – and put them together.
Ultimately, it depends on taste – you try to think of the best things humanity has ever created, and in a way you try to project them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I’ve never been ashamed to steal the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were outstanding musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and coincidentally also the best computer professionals in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they would have done amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the Health Care Act while their case was being dealt with in court
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to accept an objection to President Obama’s Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a ceremonial dinner sponsored by a law firm to attend the hearing before the court.
The incident occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the submitted proposals.
One of the cases discussed was a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging the radical revision of health care passed by Congress last year – a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the lawsuit, but a 5.5 hour hearing is expected to take place in March, and the results of which will further expand the presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who will face the court and try to get the bill rejected will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Attorney General under George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society group, which has been engaged in defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations challenging the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel a few hours after a court discussion on the case.
It was attended, among others, by Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Republicans in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: These two judges have been participating in the events of the Federalist Society for years.
There is nothing that is contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to abide by the principles of conduct to which lower federal judges are subject.
If it were not, however, their behavior would fall under the C4 principle, which states that "the judge may participate in events that are organized by related and other organizations in order to raise funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honorary guest, nor be listed on the agenda of the event."
Nevertheless, Scalia’s and Thomas’s relationship with the two law firms involved in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in the case, was sufficient to alarm activists calling for ethics in the government.
“This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct contradicts several judges’ claims that the Supreme Court behaves according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and ate dinner for a social benefit together with lawyers waiting for their case to be heard in court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines the feet with any claims of impartiality, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding to their critics, telling them that they also easily combined their judicial duties with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas’s wife Ginni is a high-ranking conservative activist.
Conservatives also argue that the ethical problem is mainly with Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the Attorney General under President Obama’s administration when the first objections to the law appeared in court.
Criticians press Kagan on her to refuse to participate in the case, claiming that she fought so much for the law then that she could now be indifferent.
Kagan did not indicate that she was about to resign.
Boeing receives record $18 billion aircraft contract
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 aircraft with the possibility of purchasing 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Aman Air for more than $1 billion.
When a company receives an order for 50 pieces of its products, most of it is no reason to celebrate.
But if that company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the cost of these 50 aircraft is a record $18 billion, it’s something else.
Equally important news is where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago airline estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest order in its history in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-way jet Boeing 777.
The airline’s headquarters is Emirates based in Dubai.
Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airlines have the option to purchase another 20 aircraft, thanks to which the total value of the contract would rise to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8, sometimes called the Dreamliner, which boasts significantly improved fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
“This is excellent news for the entire Boeing company,” said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
“The quality of these specific customers is very high.”
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil-producing nations.
That means they not only have money to pay for aircraft, but the rise in fuel prices – mostly damaging airlines because they are some of its biggest costs – is not so decisive as the country itself earns on higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to rising fuel prices, Dihora says.
“They have such natural protection,” he says.
The Emirates contract strengthens Boeing’s leadership position in the wide-body aircraft market and narrows Airbus SAS, which sought to undermine Boeing’s dominance with its transport model A350.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus officials announced the first flight of their largest A350, a direct competitor to the 777-300ER.
The shift occurred because customers demanded greater utility load and range, so the manufacturer took the time to provide the machine with more engine power.
The share price of Boeing Co rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister defeated in Michoacán election
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of the PRI, was helped by drug dealers in the hunt for the governor’s seat.
His sister, Felipe Calderona, appears to have lost the election for Governor of Michoacan on Monday afterwards, stating that one of her opponents was helped by drug traffickers to win.
The preliminary results were attributed to the leadership in the governor elections of the western state to Faust Valley by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The interference of members of organized crime in the entire electoral process and especially in the course of yesterday’s elections is alarming not only for Michoacan, but for our entire country,” said Luisa Maria Calderon in an interview with the radio after Sunday’s elections.
“They threatened our candidates, members of the opinion polls... they seized the polling stations, they built road barricades... and they let people vote on order for the PRI.
PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost the presidency.
However, he plans to return to power soon, and winning the election in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who led a day before the election, only very tightly.
Calderon, a conservative candidate for her brother’s National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as the winner.
Third was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which has so far controlled the governor’s office.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state's capital Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and urges other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacan has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the native state of President Calderon and it was in Michoacan in December 2006 that he launched a military struggle against the merchants.
However, the violence continued.
The PAN mayor, a supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was murdered just a week before the election and many candidates from the election resigned out of fear.
However, no matter what the results of the Michoacan elections look like for the PRI party, a victory will help the party to gain a new momentum.
The anticipated PRI representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington congratulated Valley, saying: "I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be prepared to help save the Eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be a global downturn that would have a negative impact on the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, chief executive of Manila-based ADB, said the two fastest-growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help the monetary bloc recover quickly through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries [Brazil, Russia, India, China] are watching all European difficulties "too uninterestedly" and said that Asian financial assistance combined with European leadership and resources will help fire the long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all in this together.”
"So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is fit," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
“So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it.”
The European Monetary Union has been tested by a severe debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the heads of government of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could drag the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to unite for emerging leading economies to help the Eurozone find solutions.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian aid would be directed through the IMF, but noted that mutual assistance – such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union’s Financial Assistance Fund, the institution for European financial stability – would give the Asian partners of European countries greater negotiation opportunities.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said "India will do what it can" to help the Eurozone as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drought in the influx of foreign capital.
“Nobody wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and we need to maintain a high growth rate."
"It's not an alternative, it's a blatant fact, because how else could we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies such as India have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid for Europe to India’s 1.2 billion people, when 800 million of them live on $2 or less a day.
“One day they might find out that the Greeks retire at fifty and enjoy their holidays on the beach, which would be hard to explain,” he said.
Lee Howell, CEO of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well-paid jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and losing sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis is threatening with a “dangerous domino effect.”
The bank’s forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011 and 2012 is now facing a “risk of decline” due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets had to develop "unpredictable spending plans" to protect them from decline and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon warns of defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned Congress on Monday that automatic budget cuts could jeopardize national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefields in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend $450 billion in budget cuts over the next ten years, but now fears another $600 billion if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and the resulting so-called blockade would result in a 23% flat-rate decline and the halt of many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, applied in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or shipyard projects - you can't buy just three-quarters of a building or ship.
“We will also be forced to disperse many of our civilian personnel, and since the cuts are expected to take place so quickly, we will also almost have to send civilians on forced leave in order to be able to meet the target requirements.”
“These changes can shake the faith of those who care about our army and seriously damage its readiness.”
Eventually, the cuts will also affect combat units, Panetta said.
"Al the accounts for financing possible overseas warfare operations will not be directly affected by this procurement, the operations there will be negatively affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta said.
There will also be cuts in contract personnel, which will result in delays in agreed contracts supporting our people’s war efforts.”
“The status of paid employees will be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers and subsequent disruption of legal and political support.”
Both senators signed a letter to Panett ten days ago, asking him for details about the possible impact on the automatic cuts in the defense ministry.
“The consequences of the U.S. defense embargo could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power.”
"We are strictly against this tough measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they published Panett's letter.
"This is not a conclusion that we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign under it."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It's only to see if Panett's letter and recent warnings will increase pressure on Congress approving the budget and increase the voices calling for the removal of the Pentagon from the list of cut-off areas.
Panetta has been more and more open in talks about possible cuts lately, even though he himself has moved to his high position in the Pentagon with years of experience in budgeting in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was putting himself into a tough battle.
At a press conference held a minute a week, the defense minister suggested a brief picture of what his resort could expect - a shell of the army, inside which, however, will be missing a core.
“It will be like a ship without sailors.”
“It will be like a brigade without ammunition.”
“It will be like an air force without trained pilots.”
“It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission,” Panetta said at the beginning of a speech at the Pentagon.
"It will be like a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
“As a result, it will welcome aggression.”
In an appendix accompanied by a letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in “significant operational risks: late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant restrictions on landings and deployments around the world; anticipated unacceptable risks in future combat operations.”
Panetta added that some of the biggest defense projects could be waiting for completion, including those that are already being tested and those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included the F-35 project, a planned new bomber, a new-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal combat ship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the army and naval infantry wanted to replace humvees.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next decade, but its advocates say it is a necessary next step in military upgrading, which is needed to deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A blatant look at recent newspaper headlines shows how serious and ubiquitous lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has full hands of work with accusations of sexually harassing several women - both sides claim the other is lying.
Penn State University administrators were accused of false testimony when they tried to hide records that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling U.S. President Barack Obama with the microphone turned on that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has destroyed entire careers and damaged the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made himself a fool by publishing information that was immediately disproved by undeniable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of abusing funds from his campaign to try to hide his non-marital relationship.
And nobody will ever forget the media circus that ran around Bill Clinton while lying during his second term in office about his sexual attraction to Monica Lewinsky.
Everywhere there are stories of fraud in school and at university.
There are instances when teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make themselves look good in their reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many fraud we encounter?
Studies have shown that in a single day you can find somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let’s assume that many of them are mercy lies.
Another study revealed that strangers cracked three times during the first ten minutes of their first meeting in life.
Determining lies, or “recognizing lies”, is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or professional reasons.
However, it is not a social game that is similar, say, to Sharadah, when one cries out, "I have you."Recognition of deception is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been disproved.
The liars are looking you in the eyes.
It’s not like they’re shaking, cocktailing, rubbing or shaving.
But don’t think it’s hard to detect and detect a liar.
A trained lies identifier can reveal the truth from the structure of sentences, small expressions in the face, the way questions are formed and their timing.
I’ve spent several years gathering scientific insights from the vast and growing industry of lying recognition and it’s clear that lying detection is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be of great help in today’s complex world – especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, conducting interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them be polished in vigilance, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men say more “self-centered” lies, while women say more lies “focused on others” – mostly to protect someone’s feelings – that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (although the lies they say most often tend to be “disgraceful”).
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others will feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called “initial observation.”
He will find out what to compare with later on.
Note the posture of the subject, his laughter, work with the voice.
You should know if someone is constantly tapping their feet so that you don’t wrongly accuse them of lying just because they start tapping their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to identify the clusters of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
Take this as a warning sign, not as evidence of a lie.
People telling lies can stop moving their upper half of the body when trying to recall their fictional story, they can turn the tips of their shoes toward the door, lean toward the exit, significantly change their posture, or show "relief after the end of the conversation" - exaggerated relief breathing and changing positions when there is a difficult confession behind them.
People conducting interviews often give a false signal that the interview is over just to see what relief will look like after it is over.
Consider the language of the subject.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once rebuked and used past time to claim that his murdered woman was alive, which started a nationwide search for her body.
People who are lying may also say, “I didn’t have any sexual relationships with that lady... Mrs. Lewinsky,” or they will repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal signs are only very minor.
Someone can use a lot of “diminishing language” when answering a difficult question: “Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... to my best knowledge.”
In such a response, too many facts are not learned, and often it is another warning signal.
There is no magic by which every lie can be revealed, but it is possible to learn the skills by which the lie can be investigated.
Through these skills, a person will have a greater chance of not hitting a liar or deceiver in his personal and professional life.
The controversial oil pipeline construction plan will be redirected after the threat of delaying approval by the U.S. government appeared
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf – thus pushing unions against each other, but reassuring environmentalists – the pipe-building company announced it was willing to redirect the project to put things back in motion.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it will move its planned pipeline route from the eco-sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraska government.
TransCanada chief executive Alex Pourbax says the company is confident that the pipeline construction will eventually be approved, although it will take a different route.
The announcement came after the State Department said last week it was postponing the decision on the federal authorization of the project from where it would not conduct studies of possible alternative routes by which it would be possible not to interfere with the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the water supply layer of Ogallala, the vast underground water reservoir.
“This is really a move forward,” Republican representative Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably postpone any decision until 2013, a year after the next year’s elections, but the authorities reject that politics would play a role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
Every day, 700,000 barrels of oil flow from Alberta to refineries in Texas.
There will be six countries on this path.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but is loved by working groups who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear while working on the pipeline.
But lawmakers in Nebraska opposed the plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to interfere with the Sand Hills region and the water-bearing layer of Ogallala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The existing Environmental Impact Study ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would only have a minor negative environmental impact, but a source from the energy industry said the Ministry’s Inspector General ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two questions.
Once upon a time, it was whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s adviser in 2008, did not represent a conflict of interest in the program.
Another is whether the company that was hired for the original study was not selected inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of being scared by her baby
The New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle furiously invaded the vestibule of their Manhattan house and scared their daughter so much that she reversed her fears.
The singer’s performance of “Lady Marmalade” scared eighteen-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered “personality changes, sleep disorders” and “increased fear of strangers,” her family said in a lawsuit filed at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10, last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a school teacher, and Genevieve were on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk parked the car, Roseanna Monk drove her luggage down to the hallway of their house on the Riverside Boulevard and took Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby away for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind my back and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and left to pick her up'
LaBelle irritated the pregnant woman.
"In an aggressive tone, she said to me, 'You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
I said, “I don’t care about your opinion.”
She became angry and began to speak silly — screaming loudly the simplest words...
She had a bottle of water with her and began to pull water out of it.
She claims that Genevieve has had a hysterical attack.
“I said to the woman, ‘Look what you’ve done to my daughter,’” said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself on her mother — who still had Genevieve in her arms — and had to stop her until her escort pulled her back into the waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The girl cried so loudly that she wept, she added.
The family later sent a letter asking for an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and spokesman do not respond to our phone calls to comment on the entire case.
The lawsuit demands compensation, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case free of charge and the family plans to give all the money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
“The aim is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions,” Davis said.
"Such behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate change has hampered the economy
During the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdez, unemployment and unreliability increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment declined and with it the economy.
The year 2011 will enter the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the reign of Maria Lopez Valdez, who calls himself the Government of Change. This government brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth was recorded and there was even a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
The low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, reduced the possibilities of growth of the state economy, reduced economic activity by 3.6% in the first half of this year. In agriculture there was a historic decline of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to a report on damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78,03% was completely destroyed and on the remaining 21,07% partial damage was detected.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a constant rise in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state recorded an increased rise during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55 053 inhabitants of the state of Sinaloa were unemployed, representing a unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August, the average unemployment continued to grow and reached 6.19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed. Compared to the first quarter, therefore, the number of unemployed increased by 18 969 people.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard Lopez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on steps taken at the level of public policy.
“We are witnessing rising unemployment related to various factors. These include, among other things, losing liquidity in the market due to resource constraints due to legislation passed by Congress in connection with anti-money laundering. For people who illegally seize dollars, it is not easy to earn, invest, or use them for something,” he stressed.
Stop migration
López Cervantes said that the demographic factor also contributes to the rise in unemployment.
“The number of people who leave for work abroad, to the United States, has decreased, both because of the difficult entry and then also because even if these people get beyond the border, it is difficult for them to find work.
Unreliability
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state works without paying benefits to the Social Security Administration.
Additional features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and unreliability.In this administrative territory, the lowest wages are from across the country, as by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pessets as of September, well below the national average of 7,375 pessets.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, 2011 also saw the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance, in the period from January to June, foreign direct investment reached the amount of $630 697 which represents a decrease of 87.74% from the amount of $5,143 312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government reports investments in the amount of 17,280 million pessets per year.
debt
In connection with the economic downturn scenario, the state’s government asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million pesos. Until November, no debt gains were recorded in any sector of the state’s economy.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Maria Lopez Valdés pointed out the lack of managerial capabilities of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, stated that in 2011 there was a lack of alignment of the will of individual sectors, including the state government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really small during this year. We must work intensively to recover the land we lost this year. In 2012 we must double our efforts, there was a lack of harmonization of the efforts of all of us and especially the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let us hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Slow economy
Loredo López said events such as the frost at the beginning of the year stopped the state’s economy and restricted its development and growth.
“The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including freezing. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to re-establish dynamics that would allow us to an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services.
Redefining the Mission
According to Theodore Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employers Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed toward more dynamic productive activities.
"Overall, we observe that it is working.We believe it is necessary to prepare a long-term plan in which the goals and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The work ahead of us
Chairman Coparmex stressed the importance of setting a vision of the future that would better guide the government’s efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to good results in various areas, there has been some progress in economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in terms of public policy leadership.
“There are elements that allow us to argue that the government is trying to be friendly.I can say that there is work done here and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us,” he said.
Arrested for 8 kg of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted for a crime of threatening health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican army on 7 June 2010 during a march on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite station 80 in the El Castillo district of Navolato.
The dealer was in a white pick-up truck. In the car he had a black bag in the shelf and a small backpack on the passenger seat. Soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the detained man remained available to the Judges of the Second Division and the proceedings remained internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Contributions to projects
Social projects that are part of programs such as Habitat, Saving Public Places and 3x1 for Migrants face the risk of not being questioned to the end or having great delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Urban Social Development said that if the construction work has so far gone forward, now there is the risk that the state government will not be able to provide the relevant supplies, which require funding of more than 11 million pesos for three programs.
He stated that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. By this time, the funds for the work were provided only by the Federation and the city, so it is possible that there will be delays in the implementation of the projects.
“They have to provide almost 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we have not received anything at all, even though we should have received a portion in July,” he said.
He stated that last year, under the administration of Jesus Aguilara Padilla, the state failed to meet the relevant supplies, and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan in order to repay more than 7 million, which the state administration did not give them.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on.
Despite the promise made by state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he said that a request was sent to Armando Villarreal, Secretary of Administration and Finance, to speed up the procedure and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
“They were supposed to give us 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we haven’t received a single peso yet.”
Court Approves "End of Analog Broadcasting" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) has rejected a constitutional lawsuit filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against a presidential decree that wants to speed up the so-called "analog signal shutdown" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juana Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing a decree outlining the individual steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the Senate’s appeal was rejected because the qualified majority of eight votes needed for the Court to comment on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the aforementioned decree, which thus remains in force, was not reached.
The draft judgment drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, since the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter reserved by law to the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Representatives supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to fight the decree.Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the application of the decree and all actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitization.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the appeal filed by the House of Representatives, without entering into the discussion of the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not identify with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general standards measures to prepare the public administration.
"I don't think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he said, adding that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of analog signals with digital is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years.It is related to better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that delaying change would mean delaying the benefits of digitalization, which requires decisions in the public interest, because digitalization is not only a technical dimension, but “it also affects economic, social, political and national security issues.”
As he stressed, these issues “require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state.
He recalled that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and have done so through their governments, despite having highly specialized technical bodies at their disposal.
He stated that it is not possible for the government, by issuing a dissenting decree, which to a certain extent interferes with the scope of Congress’s powers, to introduce in the sphere of administration the observance of laws prepared by the legislative power.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to data released by PREP, the difference between the first and second seats in the Governor's election is less than 27 percent.
The possibility of counting "vote by voice" appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, according to data released by the Programme of Preliminary Election Results (PREP), the difference between the first and second seats in the governor's elections is less than 27 percent, and 879 votes out of a total of 6,074 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
In this context, the Chair of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacan (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral authority approved a series of measures that should harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not officially approve of its political constitution or its State Election Code or the Act on Electoral Justice, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral period had expired, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel neglected to publish them within the specified deadline in the Official State Gazette Act, having any objections to them.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislature and declared the head of state's vote on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because it has no right to "neither approve nor veto".
Asked about the possibility of counting "vote by voice", María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council, it would be possible for the partial and total counting to be carried out by the local electoral authority.
In this way, the partial counting of the votes, of one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of the votes and the calculation in the appropriate box or it is not available to the President; or if there have been errors and obvious violations of the election results.
In addition, a total recalculation of votes in all polling stations will be possible if there is indication that the difference between the potential winner of the elections and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever at the beginning of the session there is an explicit request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition that has proposed the candidate in second place.
A total recalculation of the votes will also be possible if, after a proper recalculation, the difference between the likely winner and the second-place candidate is found to be equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate ended in the second place.
It should be mentioned that in such a situation are the elections in Morelia, where, according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second places is less than 0.16%, even though 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported to his hometown of Saltillo on Sunday night.
According to the family, Lieutenant Colonel’s last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountains.
After receiving the highest honors together with the other people who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortese family returned to the capital Coahuila on board a Mexican Air Force aircraft.
At noon, the colonel’s ashes reached the chapel on the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell ceremony was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, which was organized by his former high school classmates and members of the American football team, which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of preparation for his graduation.
“He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes would be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains. This is how he always told his family and friends,” said Sandra Bacio Cortés, pilot’s sister.
According to her, the Lieutenant Colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the height of life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and enrolled in the Colegio del Aire air school in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always went after his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he barely came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even recalls that when he was seven he went to Zapopán for his uncle's graduation, so he is convinced that he died at what he loved most in life: flying.
He gave him the last goodbye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that came to him from Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and the government of the state, the Mexican Army through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Saltillo Technical High School, where he studied in 1985 and where he stood out in both study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the past days after a helicopter that he was driving crashed. On board was also the secretary of government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other persons, all officials of this state.
At 18:05 the remains of Bacio Cortese, a native of Saltilla, arrived to be handed over through a funeral service to the Mexican Air Force under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez to the area where the family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers were gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies found on Cadereyta NL farm
A few hours before the discovery, military officials introduced to the media 11 people who had been detained in the area for crimes related to organized crime.
The bodies of three men murdered by shooting into different parts of the body and head were found on an abandoned farm in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find occurred on a 1.5 kilometre road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the hut with a beige-coffee fence had open doors from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One person was wearing a yellow sports shirt and dark cotton pants and was not wearing shoes. Next to him, a man was also lying in a sports shirt with white strips.
A few meters further there was the body of another person dressed in a red sports t-shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three lay faced to the ground.
According to data obtained on the spot, all three people were probably killed elsewhere because no bullets were found.
Messages addressed by one group of organised crime to another were found on the fence of the cottage, as well as a number of bullet tracks, both on the building and on the doors.
11 suspects arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defense presented 11 people, including minors, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and is associated with kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burial.
According to published information, during the first attempt on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, eight people were arrested and one detained man was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were seized and they confirmed they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Military personnel were in the ranch in the area of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta when they noticed cars without SPZ and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they conducted a search and discovered one rifle, ammunition and 18 bullets.
Then, on the basis of these testimony, one of the accomplices in the area of La Frauda was arrested on November 13, around 4 p.m. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were accused of illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
The appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that is keeping the country above the pit of an economic disaster.
The appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face a crisis that is keeping the country above the pit of an economic catastrophe and that has put the entire eurozone at risk.
The Presidential Palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgi Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to represent a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were overcome.
“The framework is now well marked,” he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a much shorter time than usual.In the meantime, Italy is struggling to fight the political and financial crisis, which has caused the level of debt to rise to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve the tough package of austerity measures demanded by European leaders.
Due to market instability, interest rates on Italian 10-year bonds BTP have exceeded the 7 percent threshold, the level when Greece and Ireland had to apply for bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, chairwoman of Italian employers’ organization Confindustria, told reporters after a meeting with Monti: “We said we will very much support this government.”
We believe this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this fierce situation.
Monti’s hopes for success were greatly increased thanks to the support of PDL’s Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are predestined to good results,” Angelina Alfano, the secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant, as up to this point a number of its members opposed the government with a technocratic majority made up by Monti.
Support of Parliament
Monti’s new government needs strong parliamentary support to push for unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in this effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could mean a catastrophe.
Monti began talks on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women organisations.
The round of talks will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, which enabled a very quick move in response to the crisis.
After a short drop from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, interest rates on Italian bonds have returned to a critical threshold, responding to uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will reap success.
Saving Italy, whose public debt amounts to 1.8 trillion euros, would be beyond the current euro zone financial reserves.
Monti said his government should remain in power until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that politicians will only give him time to carry out reforms and then call early elections.
Monti said he would like to incorporate politicians into his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this government must only be made up of experts to get Italy out of the hardships the country has come into due to financial pressure.
Political sources said mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicated the attempt to integrate political figures into the government.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish players, 10 have crossed the limit of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 called players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the part of Costa Rica, if we compare 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 on the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, the number one in the monthly FIFA rating, have a wide range of A-class internships, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Umano, who has played 50 international matches.
He reached this number last Friday in a match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers who play in the Champions League and in powerful clubs in the English Premier League haveined intensive activity in league championships and domestic cups and high-level European cup matches such as the Champions League over the past year.
We must also add to the previous experience of the Spanish national team in complicated elimination matches for the European and World Championship.
Costa Rica players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, the Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team has on his account goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (defeat 0-1 in London) hit former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches.
Casillas will face Costa Rica today and set a new record for Spain – 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 matches on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced by UEFA last week along with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their account. Among them was already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke midfielder Raúl González with 102.
Carles Puyol played 97 matches.
Followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rican side and close to Michael Umano, the left wing is Junior Díaz with 48 matches and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Furthermore, only five overcame the 30 game line: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Minimum number of matches.
With fewer than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain’s best goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour on the occasion of celebrating 20 years of existence
"Travel to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band itself assures them that playing in Costa Rica is a dream fulfilled.
This is what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, speaking exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is on tour in South America to celebrate their 20th anniversary and will be on a unique stop in Central America on Sunday.
He will perform at the National Stadium from 7:30 p.m. together with the angel band The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample from the interview, the full transcript of which can be found on the La Nación website on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican fans, this is a fulfilled dream. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
Traveling to Costa Rica is also our dream that becomes a reality.
We’ve been to South and Central America hardly a second time and the experience so far has been great.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation.It’s a wonderful country and I believe we’ll be able to stay here for a few days.
We are delighted to bring you our music.
I ask, because they literally love the group here, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your biggest supporters?
Thank you for standing with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica.Thank you for waiting so long and we’re sorry it took us so long.
Some people talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it put more pressure on you?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve shown in the last 21 years have taken place within a few weeks.
We had a few great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope to get in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We really look forward to this concert.
We love this country, we love surfing, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing to Costa Rica or Nicaragua, or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. So we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
Looking at your tour, you’ve prepared a great show with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played here, we don’t have any limitations on what we couldn’t do.
We will try to show the best show possible with a variety of songs.We will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a good and diverse repertoire.
Never repeat the repertoire.
Why ?
I think it’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 tracks and everyone likes different tracks, so it’s hard to choose what songs we’re going to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we have not played for a long time, we focus on them and are also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and so I think it is more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of artistic career.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve done?
Yes, it is.
First, I think no one of us could have imagined that we would be in one big rock band and that we would stay in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much we have been given, and it impresses us that we can continue to play together.
We love and love to make music.
We are lucky to be able to see the places we have always wanted.
We could not have done better.
What meant for you that you were an important part of the formation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which the great ones are represented.
The people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
Surprisingly, when a movement arises from a group of friends, it doesn’t happen too often.
From time to time a group is formed in a city, but it is far less common for five to ten groups to arise from one city at once.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play with others.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We're lucky to be all our friends and it's an honor to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and have the same members even after those years.
Yes, we four have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think we are all lucky to be still in this world, and secondly we are always interested in each other.
We’re all close friends and thanks to this we’ve managed to open up musical paths that leave everyone enough freedom to experiment on their own.
We trust each other, we value each other’s music and I think it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship to the word fame was not easy, however, thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it was increasingly easier to find balance.
We try not to ride too much on tour because it’s very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you remind yourself that you must respect music and what you gave it. You must not be taken away by being famous rock stars.
What do you remember from Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote great songs and in the beginning it was something spectacular.
We existed as a band for three years and never released an album until Andy (Andrew Woods) passed away.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that today we are still friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in a band with us. When I listen to a song or look at the photos, I remember Andy how incredible he was, how I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh, have fun with him about music or football and much more.
He was an incredible person and we miss him very much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you chose them as pre-scooters?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several suggestions and this group liked us the most. Therefore, we are curious what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very fun.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That’s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He sings it and I think he adds the first thing he thinks of.
Who influences you as a bassist?
A lot of people.
The first to attack me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all night about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge, even though it is no longer in fashion?
I think we’ve all always felt easily separated from the word grunge.
When it comes to grunge, I think of the bands I’ve mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that were created at the same time.And if music is still valid today, it’s great because it’s music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever before.
At first your music had a slightly cloudy character and now it is more positive.
What is behind this change?
That’s interesting because I feel like there are a few tracks in the new album that are lighter, but also there are songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very cloudy, although they may sound positive.
In both, when Ed played them to me, I cried, and the songs are deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs are exactly what they mean to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
The Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday to be tested for muscle loss in the lower limbs, his doctor said.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who serves a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated four times and is currently under medical control.
Deputy Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Canal N television that Fujimori would undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases within three days, where they should find out why he hurts and why he loses strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said he believes Fujimori could be granted grace for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want grace because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times because of the cancer of the tongue, dropped 18 kilograms and added other problems such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has served in prison since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by a murder squadron of soldiers acting illegally in the first years of his reign.
Mujica to visit Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of a large-scale visit full of meetings with leaders of politics, business and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting between the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political affairs between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to force Calderón to support Uruguay in the dispute with France that arose after French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 summit in Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be removed from the international community.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November.The G20 is a group of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world.It has signed an information exchange agreement with the Latin American country since January this year to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government in recent years has sought to concrete fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the "black list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which there are countries that have not introduced all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
Mexico and Uruguay have signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in 2004 to strengthen trade between the two countries.
Frizzy Installer Running in 3D Thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the scars of the villain Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to all stores around the world this month, has been created from the outset to take advantage of all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
“Mario is a character who has to tell you how a stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Omar Álvarez, a spokesman for Nintendo in Spain, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier" because until now successful footage like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to being a 3D shot, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth batch.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have overcome this level, you can go into the "second round" on the levels of the game, which are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real-time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of action, but it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome various challenges and "not suffer from optical deception".
This new advent of Super Maria in 3D also presupposes with the return of the character to a portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays a note to those who watch the saga and repeats the successful formula from previous episodes. It consists in a bearded man's waterproofer having to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find new things in the movements, in the surroundings, in the outfits and also among the enemies, the "playful" Luigi will also appear.
Colom approves extradition of Portilla to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has taken steps to extradite former U.S. President Alfonso Portillo, who is to be held accountable in the United States for a conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This ends the process aimed at Guatemala’s response to a request from a northern country that demands Portillo’s extradition so that he can be tried.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was consistent with the independence of the judiciary and the executive power and that he was aware that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his term of office he had "not interfered" with court decisions and authorized all editions that came to his table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injury and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom’s move means a step of execution after all the judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to lead the trial against the former president who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited after his legal situation in Guatemala is settled and respect for human rights is guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent in the case of bribery of $120 million to the Ministry of Defence during his presidency. This process preceded the release, but the Public Ministry appealed and put the case back into play.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people in danger
The organization was created to help children without education not be marginalized by society.
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of Trinijova’s existence is very important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have received help.
To this it is necessary to add a long hundred jobs that have been gained for this social group.
Yesterday’s anniversary also served to present the balance sheet as part of a ceremony that took place in the former Fabra and Coats production facilities and attended more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, unemployed, struggling with drug addiction or in situations where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday’s meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the unified character of the work carried out by Trinijov.
Along with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the ceremony was attended by former Socialist Advisor for Education, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current Ecosocialist Councillor, Ricard Goma.
The great Fabra and Coats Hall was also attended by the current Advisor for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General for Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was created at a very difficult time and that today’s time also has a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day “is a good foundation.”
The president cited Trinijov as an example of how it is possible to fight against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does," he said.
There was an evacuation of the occupied house where giant parties were held.
The invaders seized 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 occupants left the house yesterday at noon without resistance
Everything suggests that the nightmare that neighbors from 51 Balmes Street experienced is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they illegally lived in and organized gigantic parties that awakened neighbors yesterday at noon.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent the situation from repeating.
“From now on, the entrance will be guarded,” the administrator said.
The occupants, who seized 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical and partly water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving behind garbage of all kinds, especially canes of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments, huge parties were held, lasting up to two days, awakening the other tenants.
Next to the building is the disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that during the time the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the disco emphasizes that the occupants of the building did unfair competition to her, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the disco costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment enterprise had to respond to the lawsuits of the neighbors because of the noise. but the problems were not caused by the visitors to the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially those who participated in the parties held here, whose frequency and intensity has increased in recent weeks, according to the angry inhabitants of the area.
The discotheque owner explained that the problems were so big that they even agreed with the owner of the building and has been forgiving her rent for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors over the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP city group in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week demanded that "the building be relocated immediately and end the problems of civil coexistence suffered by neighbors and the destruction of the area".
The leader of the people explained that only one floor was occupied before the summer, but in recent months the occupants have entered all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and in one of them there has even been theft.
In this regard, he added that "the impunity needs to be put to an end and to be consistent when it comes to acts against civil liability that occurred in the building."
Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30, police entered building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being called by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Architects gathered on the occasion of a draft procedure that brings with it more than polemics about fees
The 16 Gate City Contest once again opens the debate about the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the time of the greatest flourishing of the already extinct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this municipality printed several pamphlets in support of Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as the big park of the metropolitan city of Barcelona.
Moreover, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York’s Central Park.
After the CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper boundary of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that are not oriented on the axis north - south, but up (top) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild bears instead of the bear Yogi.
This was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega contest consisting of 16 calls for the same number of entrances to Collserola.
The gate of course captures the idea of the park.
Either this or someone is trying to place the gate on the field.
So the only question arises: Collserola, a park or a mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and based on a reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It’s already a topic as shaken as when two members of this old caste, elected at the meeting in the elevator, hand in hand.
And this was one of the rare coincidences between what three Barcelona architects and leading university professors thought.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is justified.
According to Roldan, after the question of the Gulf Party was raised, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side", so that Ildefonse Cerda's speech about green apples was not finished.
“We have to start from the principle that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its high availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "the gates to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as the definition of zones where it is possible to operate".
Modol, as well as Roldán and Bayona, with experience from the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an “intellectual challenge” presenting “some dangers”.
The danger arising from the “uncertainty presented by the public space project today” after the experience of the 1980s, which had its “labyrinth singing” in the Forum area.
The first concern is the definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
“To define something is to take the next step,” that is to say, to move one step further.
"New urban planning and planning tools need to be kept in mind, as the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus on the question in more detail, Modol believes that the Collserola valley slope can be "considered a park", but not the Barcelona part, for purely topographic reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not end up in the garbage dump", although he welcomes the fact that the city council offers his gremio to intervene in the project from the "first moment".
And moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of leappoint that allows architects to engage in the debate, but he “doubts” that it should be precisely this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams (“it’s all about skills,” he adds) that need to be created: “Architects should only be tools.”
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name to this game is complicated because Collserola’s global vision is lacking in the procurement documents: “Sixteen procurements have been announced that deal with all the axes of the mountain – the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole.”
This means that at least he has applied to all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the design of one gate can strike the concept and definition of the architect of the neighboring gate.
According to him, the city council should ensure that the zone directly above the Ronda de Dalt should provide equipment throughout the zone to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino apologizes to Jonási Larrazabal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the lawful representative, Cadino Red, granted grace to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal has spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after his legal representative, Casino Red, has granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal Court of that district, which dealt with the case of blackmail in which the brother of the mayor of Monterrey was accused.
Following the assassination of Casino Royale, the owner of Casina Red, Sergio Gil García, posted a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás had to ask him to pay an economic quota in order for the Monterrey City Hall to allow an illegal operation in the betting house.
After a public indictment, the State Prosecutor’s Office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the panistic mayor. on September 2, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then after 4 hours spent in front of Prosecutor's Office Agent No. 3 for property crimes, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the capital of the state.
He remained there for the following 49 days after a second order for imprisonment was issued and a public prosecutor denied the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casina Red for a sum of one and a half million pesos.
He was allowed to stay in the city cell in San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
On October 25, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation enough evidence was collected to allow proof of Jonas’ guilt.
This Monday, Casina Red’s legal representative, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region.
During the legal hearing, the Attorney General’s representative assigned to the court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gómez whether the damage had been repaired and who of the associates had decided to grant the grace.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, a legal grace is granted to Jonási Larrazabal. No complaint can be filed in the proceedings against him. It is also not possible to claim damages or punishment.
After hearing with the lawful representative around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton.
The court secretary, Jorge Yanéz, arrived at a prison in the city of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been granted an official grace and his case had been deposited in the archive.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the plane crash that killed the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transportation (SCT) that the results of the investigation into the accident in which Prime Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people were killed showed that the helicopter crashed directly to the ground with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for Communications and Transportation, said that before the aircraft took off, the pilot stated that the weather conditions of the flight allowed.
"The parts that appear indicate that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, wings entangled in the branches of trees 25 meters from where the unit lost the body."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 people, so it met all the requirements for the transportation of personnel.
In addition, he said that based on the investigation carried out in the impact area, no components were found on the ground.
"During the search, it was found that parts of the aircraft were not found elsewhere, so the aircraft crashed into the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, meeting all the requirements for passenger transportation.
The terrain shows a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment the most important thing is to get results as quickly as possible.
Gilberto López Meyer, director general of airports and auxiliary services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was moving at cruise speed and the crash occurred on a soft rising terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the crash it was a normal overflight operation," he said.
At a press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome outlined six key points of the investigation:
Visual Flight :
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must see the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in the AICM indicate adequate conditions at the start, according to which the aircraft is advancing towards the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico were noticeable layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes :
It is likely that due to the clouds the crew sought a lower area and greater visibility up to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the helicopter from the radar coincide, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disturbance of the flight trajectory before the impact.
Dispersion of aircraft remnants on a limited territory:
The information we currently have at our disposal allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The drawing of the dispersal of the aircraft remains indicates that at the time of the impact on land the helicopter was holistic.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene of the accident that suggested there was an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that there may have been several contacts with the land.
During field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain swings, the altitude of the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
Photographs show footage, which is likely to have resulted in a breakdown along the mentioned route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After careful searches around the accident, no remains of the helicopter were found in a territory wider than the area of excavation, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in a state when the helicopter was still integral.
Mexican Institute of Health Insurance launches research into the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance is conducting research to discover the gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to uncover the gene causing obesity in children and young people.
In a report, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, with or without permission, can also participate in the research. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centers in the Valle de México, where youth tests will be carried out from 8 a.m. every council.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Center (Mexico State) and since October 8, this activity is also carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Center (East Mexico State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children is collected, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to trace risk factors in Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the goal is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
Every Saturday, anthropometric measurements are performed to all participants (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels are determined, and genes are examined (they try to identify the genes involved in the development of childhood obesity).
Cruz López said the research reflects healthcare professionals’ concerns about the alarming increase in child weight.
“Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years only, there was a 77% increase in obesity in boys and 47% in girls.
He stated that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the assumption that the country’s population differs from other populations by its genetic history.
He that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that generally speaking, obesity genetics is commonly explained as the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants was that they were given an overall assessment of the condition of the children, thereby determining whether they showed any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and elbow indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and prediabetes conditions.
The information is confidential so far, doctors forward it in writing to parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make to avoid their children from getting sick.
Cruz López explained that there are three main ingredients that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle that means a lack of daily physical activity, day-to-day sitting in front of television, and using transportation instead of walking short distances.
Overweight is also caused by high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetic load that is the subject of this research.
There will be no asphalt from UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, creates modified asphalt with polymers to create a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climate conditions and temperature.
If the flooring was properly cared for, there would be no need to repair 200,000 dams after every rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Region, Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, said, adding that if the design and maintenance of the asphalt flooring were adequate, there would be a significant reduction in dams, or even it would be possible to completely remove them.
In his lecture Technological Cause of Moles, which he delivered within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalt with polymers, thereby creating a mixture having similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, for example in some cities in the north of the country.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a group of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a large molecular weight called asphalt, and other low molecular weight called malt.
The visco-elastic character of asphalt lies in the fact that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures it tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but varies during the day depending on weather conditions and temperature, the chemical engineering expert noted.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible tiles made up of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers there is an asphalt insert, formed by small stones poured into asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that forms the insert is covered with asphalt.
When passing by cars or creating pressure, it is so possible that the forces in the tile are well distributed.
If it were modified asphalt, it would be even better distributed, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that the last layer, called a coat, will be placed on the asphalt insert, formed by fine stones, i.e. sand also poured into asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with the vehicle racks, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the road.
Since it will be exposed to a large load as part of the flooring, the coat must have a sufficient thickness and must pay attention to the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind.
Once the terrain is moist, the water spreads inside and is difficult to get out, this causes the softening of all layers of the tiles and thus the formation of moulds.
He explained that during the creation of moulds, the coat film is first destroyed and only then the asphalt insert is damaged. Damage does not occur in one moment, but it is a slow process that should be stopped at the first signs using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of moulds, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of tiles must correspond to the load of vehicles and must be guaranteed that this load is not exceeded.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that as far as the asphalt is concerned, we still have a lot of work to do and the research is at the beginning.It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and allow for easy repairs without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not win the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle thus wins the 14th title first multi-emiss.
Valle del Cauca won Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with being on the podium of the winner, winning a silver crown and a sherpa, on the basis of which she became the new first major emiss Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday’s final in Cartagena, in which Miss Atlantico won and won, the department won the 14th title of first multi-miss. Melina joined the women’s groups from Valle del Cauca, which reached the winning crown, but were finally proclaimed the first multi-miss. Among them are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
A question many have asked themselves, what is missing?
The result is the defeat of the big favourite, who in all previous rounds showed that she has to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing became the Queen of Police and the Most Beautiful Face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved, for example, by Italy Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that determined that the jury decided to name her only the First moreemiss was the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: "What book did you like the most and why?" asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of the literary editorial Leamos.
To the question the candidate replied:
"I read a lot. I very much believe in the role of literature, I think it is one of the forms of culture. The book that most influenced me in childhood was "The Little Prince", a very profound book.
Currently I am reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the world literature that we should all know. And today I have a book with me from Irene Nemirovski, the Russian author. This is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer was not liked, on the one hand, because of the term "cultured" and, on the other hand, because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned marked her.
At the end of the ceremony, Melina declared that she was calm and delighted with the outcome: "The world is wise, what is supposed to happen, will happen.
And you people, read if you can, The Little Prince is a wonderful book.”
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the favourite position.
The Bogotá journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was from the beginning the most popular, the most celebrated and the one who won all the previous awards (Gastronomical Challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other candidates, stressed the queen, who then burned on the stage.
This was evident during the first presentation of the swimsuits on Hilton’s beach and during the two shows before the final coronation.
Even though she shone on both, it was known that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm that the representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for Canal RCN’s “Like at Home” program, believes that the fact that Melinda won the title of first multi-emiss confirms the fact that the candidate who won the most titles during the competition will not eventually leave with the queen’s crown.”
In addition, Valle has held a rather ungrateful attitude toward the media in recent days and it has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the foundation of the National Beauty Competition.
Just two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of their country.
“In the Miss Colombia beauty competition, beauty alone is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition,” she explained.
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis that was visible on the tail. But this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which chose her miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queen, acknowledges that Melina didn't have the best body, that there were better girls, "but problems with fibrosis on the buttock, which in my opinion wasn't too noticeable, took her points until the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine believes that a roommate from Valle made a mistake by undergoing several surgeries.
“The surgical interventions are fine, but they didn’t work in Valle.
The body was never her stronger side, and here she picked her tax.”
Because of this award, which was first awarded by the National Assembly of Beauty, after the show in the swimsuits, a harsh prediction came to pass, which was claimed to be the satisfaction that Raymundo gave Melina so that he didn’t have to eventually award her the highest crown.
Whether this is true or not, it is certain that Melina has begun the year of her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named by the National Competition itself.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite the striking success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of the Cali resident who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A fingerprint expert from Cali entered history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonsa Cana".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, last year, a fingerprint expert from the CTI in Cali entered history as the man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader of the FARC: "Alfonse Cana," through a comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working at the CTI department, this week the line was on Eliazar González, a man from Puerta Tejada who has been working in forensic research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the town hall of Chocó, where he often had to wander through the forest for more than five days in order to get to the site where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital, Valle, and after completing relevant courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints.This science deals with the study of the friction of the skin, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
In the week that the operation was carried out against the said Alfonso Can, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night he flew to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two bodies and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world.
However, when he came with the investigative team to the place where the corpse was located, he did not recognize him because of his physical appearance.
He had no beard, dressed like a villager in the area, without glasses, much slimmer.
Fingerprints are not lying.
Along with galton scabies, ink and transplant and light, Eliazar began to compare the dactile records of the corpse with the records of the card.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was instructed to confirm the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, whether he really was the top commander of the FARC.
Search stop
For the Dactyloscope of Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos showed to Eliazar González at the press conference of the Operational Service against "Can" is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in deciding on crimes.
In addition to identifying bodies, these people help investigate crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they are caught, a lot of criminals present fake documents or have no papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the house’s wall in the house, because in this place the thief was relying to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not designed to take fingerprints, but in this case we could get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove a suspicion in case of murder.
A man was found dead with bottles of alcohol around him.
The investigation found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder, and the fingerprint on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it is not possible to confirm 100% that he was really a murderer, it is clear that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
A fingerprint expert from the CTI explained that from the objects, the fingerprints are “wiped out using chemical or physical reactive substances.”
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used to collect them.
The fingerprints are then sent to Asif, which is a criminal database, or to the Registratura.
"The problem is that at the moment there are still many Colombians whose data is nowhere," said an expert from CTI.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Like everything that glitters, there is no gold, not everything that you touch leaves traces.
However, if it can be used, a corresponding comparison must be made.
Protesters protest in New York
Hundreds of protesters clung to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to stand.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the space and moved to the nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York officials on Tuesday when they tried to get back to Manhattan Square by court order, from where they were taken in the morning.
Hundreds of protesters struggled to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get thanks to a court order allowing the "indignant" to return to the square. The second part of the movement responded to the cleansing by seizing the park in the north of the city, where further arrests occurred.
“If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle elsewhere and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through gatherings and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray said the "indignant" response to the displacement ordered by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg had reached court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forced displacement of the camp and allowing protesters to continue to reside there.
In addition, another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the landmark of the fair at Trinity Church, took off the "indignation."
They managed to occupy the place for at least an hour, but then the police arrived and detained some of the protesters.Bray did not know the exact number, but said he had seen some journalists put on bonds.
The organization assures that several hundred people settled on the site, and a delegation of religious leaders came to express their support and also tried to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed.A trial is expected, which should take place on Tuesday, and during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters even carried and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to the square guards, provoking "some small clashes," Bray said, condemning the fact that some police beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the Occupy Wall Street movement or applying “laws that were published after the rally began, or prohibiting protesters from entering the park with shops or other places they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that the city had suspended the reopening of public spaces due to the court order and warned protesters that local laws do not allow them to return their tents and sleeping bags.
The city’s top official personally defended the morning evacuation of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and engaged because protesters “violated the law.”
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it became “a place where people didn’t go to protest, but violate laws and in some cases hurt others” because “some shops received threatening letters” and “neighbors were worried about the quality of their lives.”
“The early clearance was shocking and shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests at the expense of the American working people,” a movement spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “disrespecting freedom of expression.”
The Occupy Wall Street movement also said it plans to organize "big events" on Thursday in collaboration with community and trade unions to commemorate the two months since the protests began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson Will Represent Virgin Mary in Special Christmas TV Show
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear in the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a swimmer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of rookie musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
Private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, along with sentimental singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a TV show in which Anderson, also known from internet home pornographic images, appears with her former husband, the "Mötley Crüe" engine, Tommy Leem, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll depicting Jesus in her cages.
As Joseph, Peters appears on stage, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently served as a host on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour.
Krome Anderson and Peters appear in the special Christmas broadcast CTV canadian singer Bublé, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March with the Argentine model Luisa Lopilato, and who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian "a fox" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returns to life after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending the fall period that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
The initial estimates of the Tokyo government estimated material losses at $300,000 million, a wound that is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of falls, the value of GDP between July and September reached such a position that it was possible to turn the page with definitive validity: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
In addition, the results of the second quarter – for the Japanese tax year starting in March 2012 – predict the highest growth rate compared to the January-March 2010 period.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery needed to restore areas destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Companies increased their investment by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% compared to the January-March period.This is the first drop after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on an impulse that forces us to use the crisis to come out of it for strength or to rebuild the infrastructure.
Especially due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, due to increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma
Flows have been entrusted to the internal market when the yen, the Japanese currency, has become one of the “rescue values” for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the U.S. worrisome forecasts.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota and Sony attributed their weak results in July to September to the exchange rate.
While the markets continue to siege the EU’s outskirts, Yoshihiko Noda’s government is cautious.
“We have to pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid increase in volatility,” said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
The outlook is not really encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member countries showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts unflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economies of the major powers are slowing down.
It fell by four-tenths to 100,4 points from 100,8 in August.
The Eurozone even fell below the 100th average, reaching 99.13 points.
Athens is still uncertain.
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With rapid and risky marginal guarantees and uncertainty re-establishing, Greece is increasingly entangled in a labyrinth that leads to a way out of the big debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "compliance" of the new transitional Greek government is given more by the demands of Brussels than by the real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period he received at his appointment would likely be short for their application, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said he would in no way support the new austerity measures and reiterated his demand for a new election on the scheduled date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said during a parliamentary debate, which will culminate in a vote of confidence in the government.
A package of 24 programmes to support employment, the reform of the disciplinary code for officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’s message does not clear any doubts about his position: “We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else.”
The Chairman of the Conservative Party went a little further in his address to the EU and the IMF. These organizations are to unblock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs. At the same time, he said that he will not support or sign any commitment regarding the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission, already upset by the impact of Papandre's referendum games, yesterday stressed that its demands are immeasurable: it will not block any aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main parties sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
A spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that inspectors from the Troika will return "very soon" to Athens and will negotiate with the new government about "what it needs to pay the sixth portion" of 8 billion.
The Greek side has a little more to do.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain’s privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain “has achieved a significant position at the global level in terms of microfinance.”
Queen Sofia yesterday recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which lies in “that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind.
The Queen yesterday launched the 5th World Micro-loan Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely necessary" for us to the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015.
Spain "will continue to work" and expand its network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly," Queen Sofia stressed, hoping that the initiatives and contribution of the summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" to whom these loans are intended primarily.
"We have achieved a lot" and "a lot of challenges are still ahead of us."
The microloan summit is meant to be not only a forum for discussion, but also a platform to support the “fundamental objectives.”
Her Majesty explained that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and 100 million families to get above the poverty threshold they currently live below.
The concept of micro-loans spread to Spain and other countries after “the pioneer of the idea, Muhammad Yunus, embarked on this journey,” the Queen said, adding that it was “an act of justice and necessary recognition.”
She described the father of this tool as “an admirable idealist who embarked on a path to fight poverty”.She got acquainted with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted directly on the spot with his loan policy.
The first global summit in Washington, D.C., and other meetings such as in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006. "At all these meetings I was able to see a constant evolution," explained the Queen, who thanks to her support for this project earned yesterday the title of "head of the family" awarded to her in Valladolid by the "movement of the poor".
Queen Sofia ended her speech by inviting participants to engage in discussions and find solutions to enable the fight against poverty to continue.
“Ethical Imperative”
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said solidarity "is an ethical imperative" to be followed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with a period of prosperity, because this cooperation is a “permanent obligation”.
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent “a serious and fair policy to eradicate poverty,” and now more than ever before, governments in developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to become the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microfinance is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates a concept based on giving confidence to people to whom everyone else closes the doors. The Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed participants in the city that “opens its doors to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious.”
The CDU proposes to elect the European president on the basis of universal suffrage
Without serious difficulties for Chancellor and Chairperson of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel held on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig the first day of Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
The question of the future of Europe was not on the agenda at first, but it did not happen until the fall, in particular to satisfy members of the party who consider the government’s policy toward the Greeks today and maybe tomorrow toward the Italians lax.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission submitted by the leadership was approved almost unanimously.
Only nine out of 1001 delegates voted against and 10 abstained.
Several minutes of applause at the end of Angela Merkel’s speech and a few hours later of Wolfgang Schäuble, the very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubts.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.”
According to the Chancellor in Europe, “the time for change has come.”
This could be expressed in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty allowing the European Union to strengthen control over the fiscal policies of the euro area member states, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal voting "to give Europe a single face".
This is, in any case, one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary move: Britain is opposed and CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same stance.
The direction is set.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the Board of Directors of the European Central Bank according to the weight of its economy, which would obviously result in strengthening the weight of Germany.
Driven by concerns about calming the climate within her party, the Chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not try to win Congress by speaking about "small" European states or states in trouble, willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe devotes one paragraph to the importance of “French-German friendship,” Angela Merkel has not quoted France.
Only indirectly.
Two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud in the case of disability?
Following the support, the UMP party and the government are launching an offensive against disability.
Nicolas Sarkozy will visit the Social Assistance Office in Bordeaux on Tuesday, December 15, to deliver a speech on the topic of fighting social fraud and redistributing solidarity, which has been ongoing since 2007.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigour but is no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on disability.
First, due to budget savings, the government intends to force private sector employees a fourth day of incapacity before they start receiving sickness benefits.
Clearly, without the consent of the company, an employee who gets sick would lose four days of salary, i.e. at least 15% of their monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring 280 million euros.
And also a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic reach: to give public employees one day of unpaid incapacity (until now they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the right-wing majority is also triggering a fraud topic this time aimed at work-related misconduct.
"The checks will be much wider and more so: if you are caught, you will be returned," Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of notifications appear to be somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about misconduct in the case of disability.
These have in fact been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and political struggle that has been yielding fruit.
The French are not more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let’s start with a few official figures.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), over 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Healthcare, in 2008, daily reimbursements amounted to €11.3 billion and accounted for 5% of healthcare spending.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity allowances and work-related accidents and 54% concerned disability, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
It accounts for only 2.5 percent of healthcare costs.
According to a study by Alma Consulting, French people had an average of 14.5 days of disability in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
Another survey published in 2007 on the job opportunities site Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed answered that they did not choose a day of disability.
Another study, this time conducted by health insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010 37.8% of incapacities were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% lasted longer.
When we compare them to their European neighbors, French workers are not more prone to disability than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS (National Research Center) showed that between 1994 and 2001, total absences (for health reasons or not) oscillated in France between 10% and 11.8%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in the case of disability is only a very small percentage compared to black work.
As for fraud, these are only small scale.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks aimed at incapacities for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that at 1.5 million checks, 13.8% of the 285,000 carried out due to short-term incapacities were “unjustified or too long,” i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacities lasting more than 45 days, 11% of cases "unadjusted or unauthorized" were counted at 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132,000.
In total, there are 169,000 “unjustified” cases per several million employees who have been incapacitated.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing work in black.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of the June report on this issue, this number would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing in the collection of taxes per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily refunds and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will need a new bailout plan
Greece will need a new bailout plan to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke before parliament, adding that the one hundred days given to his government of unity would not be enough to fulfill this task.
“In order to rebuild our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new bailout budget plan,” the prime minister said during his first public speech at the opening of the parliamentary vote of confidence.
The implementation of the decisions taken on October 27 at the eurozone summit will be the “main task” of the new government, as our country’s participation in the eurozone is at stake, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country’s public deficit would be “around 9%” of GDP from now until the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Government rejects new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday expressed his support for the already-approved measures to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party is not committed to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras said at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
We have agreed on targets for reducing deficits and debt and fighting waste, but we are against any policy that would hinder economic recovery.
To Mr. Ollim Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary €8 billion loan without written guarantees from all parties to support the planned measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized, experts say
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians are denied death.
With regard to palliative care, the Commission urges governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives on the idea of rejecting death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make a decision in that regard.
This is one of the conclusions of an extensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which included six experts working in different fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The committee recommends that the government amend the criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if such a choice appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
In the beginning, experts cite a recent survey by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada was ranked 10th, the study notes that “Canada’s medicalization of death has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.”
Medication yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with a mandate from the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in the province of Québec this figure is the highest with 86% of people dying in hospitals.
Regarding the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change the criminal law concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts, who have also checked all countries where these approaches are legalized or are not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalization causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons incompetent or disagreeing.
In contrast, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday at a teleconference more than a number of cases of such overtones in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasia is also practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is also done in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explained Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians oppose euthanasia
Recall that according to a survey conducted by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already voted in favor of euthanasia because they believe it will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the lives of the elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
As for those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe they should not be prosecuted.
In terms ofining or interrupting patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Also in the list of their recommendations, they propose that it be stated in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The committee of experts also demands that professional doctors be educated on the obligation to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of life without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Commission urges governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final tranquilization already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission demands that it be regarded as euthanasia and be subject to the same procedures when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain.
Resolutions of Other Experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society’s expert report.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, called the position of the experts signatories of the report "extreme" among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the final stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over the age of 18 could ask for help to commit suicide," said Pierre Deschamps, who studied the summary of the report yesterday.
P. Deschamps also emphasizes that it looks like the authors of the report are building the autonomy of a person above all other values that shape the social vanguard of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions".
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she called a "manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, doubts the data of the report regarding the absence of errors in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the U.S. state of Oregon.
Jordanian King Calls on President Assad to Resign
Damascus talks about a “conspiracy”
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Bashar al-Assad supporters demonstrated in front of the Foreign Ministry.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria by President Bashar al-Assad intensified, who with the support of Russia resists them and speaks of a “complot” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have taken a position in favor of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was yesterday the first Arab ruler to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "delete power" in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the regime's military forces have been killed.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at the heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a country neighboring Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts devoted to Turkish mediation with the Syrian regime undertaken since the beginning of the year have not been crowned with success.
“Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is applying an increasingly tough line.
The U.S. has called for “strengthening consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime’s dishonest conduct” following the Arab League and the European Union’s decisions.
“The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, and countries like Turkey are applying an increasingly harsh tone” against the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of pro-regime forces have been killed in the city of Deraa in southern Syria.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed "in gunfire and concentrated gunfire in the town of Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, at a news conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country had "set out of the crisis".
He also responded vividly to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus’ membership, which he called a “dangerous move.”
Syria "will not bend," he added, assuring that "complots against Syria will not succeed."
Following its decision to suspend Syria’s membership, the Arab League is currently considering a “mechanism for protecting civilians” and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favorable to the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he says behaves "paranoidly".
A new special meeting of the League is being convened tomorrow in Rabat to take a position on the crisis resolution plan, which was decided on 2 December and which included in particular the withdrawal of armies from the cities plagued by riots and the release of imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League's decision "faulty" yesterday, while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while completely avoiding support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifices for Italians
Italy's next prime minister, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and start implementing a program that will include "victims" in order to regain credibility lost in Berlusconi's last months of government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting with representatives of unions and employers today.
He should form a relatively thin cabinet composed of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about an important program with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the designated prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti presenting a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti yesterday commented on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked them for time.
In “democracy there are precise deadlines” when it comes to the preparation of the government and its program, he stressed, adding that he is “assured that the markets will be patient and understandable.”
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concerns reappeared after an unexpected September downturn in euro area industrial production.
The appointed prime minister should set up a team comprising mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politicians" in it.
He said he believes the new government will last until the next election in 2013.
Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, said the new government would get the confidence of parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Monti promised that he would act with extreme urgency and with the aim of making Italy "again a strong link" to Europe.
A spokesman for the European Commission, Olli Rehn, stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not its target of a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
The head of the Confindustria business union, Emma Marcegagli, who will meet with Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that does not show growth cannot meet deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence, "a professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the book, "a call to seriousness" and "another Italy", represents for Italy "an epochal change" after 17 years of "Berlusconism".
It will be a lifetime of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections as Italy has to place government bonds worth 200 billion euros by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko has helped Iran develop a detonator used for nuclear weapons, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risks said on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "serious concern" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the Islamic State Institute, which widely draws on IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should have worked for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he should have been engaged in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he had to leave the center to establish a company in Kiev producing "nano-diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he worked on the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls “clear evidence that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran” was based “on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew the method well, but who – as one member state to the agency – worked on this technology during a substantial part of his career as part of the military nuclear program of the country from which he originated.”
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of crimes and crimes directed against Muslims has increased by 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while other racial and religious violence at the same time has slightly decreased or slightly increased.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase compared to the 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offenses against Jews and a 14% overall increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hatred crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After the decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again,” Human Rights First, a human rights organization, said in a statement, adding that “the rise in anti-Muslim violence is significant.”
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be treated as a serious violation of human rights,” adds one of the organization’s leading officials, Paul Legendre.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these atrocities,” he added, estimating that this could be done by improving police reports of “hatred crimes.”
The "hatred crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights struggle.
This law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more like Facebook
Twitter, a microblogging service provider, introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe followers’ activity, somewhat reminiscent of its Facebook services.
The new "activity" and "name" menus allow you to better and directly know the activities of other people who are following you or whose responses ("tweets") you are following.
This allows you to know whether they allow you to track posts, whether they sign in to new accounts, whether they have favourite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before being spread across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for repeated dissemination of someone else’s post, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s’ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" differently assess the importance of this innovation.
“It’s useless, it takes up a lot of space and it’s too much like Facebook,” @jemb123 wrote.
"Activity will help me better track some elements of my Twitter," wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austrian
The Golden Rule of Balanced Budget
The government of a large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write the "golden rule" of fiscal policy into the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid a possible downgrade of the Austrian rating agencies (AAA).
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of the ministerial meeting in a situation where the Austrian public debt is with its 74.6% high above the maximum criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency was reduced by just one single degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more on interest each year,” said Christian Democratic Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus follows the request of the eurozone summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where heads of state and government strongly called for the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of balance of public accounts to be entered into a constitution or law of the same value by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP), and starting in 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP annually, while the federal states, as well as municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The objective is to bring the public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Strong Jen
Noda threatens to intervene in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yošihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to re-interfere in foreign exchange markets if it would only continue to strengthen.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find too much volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to historic values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which just recently broke the record against the dollar since 1945.
But only since then has it regularly risen backed by purchases by investors who see it as a “safe harbor” in uncertain times of world economic slowdown and European debt-induced crisis.
The dollar fell again below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen barrel to close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro was worth more than 160 yen.
This outburst of the Japanese currency is detrimental to the island’s exports, as it increases the price of products made in Japan and reduces the value of revenue obtained by Japanese firms from abroad when they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the devastation caused by the March earthquake and tsunami wave that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, Noda stressed, fearing that this surge in the yen will not kill a fragile recovery even in the egg.
The world’s third-largest economy regained growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in a year thanks to a survey of the growth of exports and consumption of households burdened by the disaster.
But the prime minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect "Japan's national economy".
Japan’s finance minister, Jun Azumi, urged the Japanese central bank (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures leading to weakening the yen.
But deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that BoJ had previously taken "appropriate measures" suggesting that no further currency weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Emission Institute increased its purchases of state treasury vouchers by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) and raised to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling of amounts it spends on purchases of various securities in order to flood with liquidity.
The Eurozone:
Rates Rise, Stock Markets Fail
The risk of a debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in weakened countries continue to rise.
European stock markets, still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, fall into negative expectations on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt lost 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
“With new tensions around the borrowing returns of the euro area countries in trouble, stock markets around the world continue to yield only a fraction of recent gains.”
"Nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an IG Markets broker, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop, which suffered due to market participants’ concerns about Europe’s ability to cope with the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and the exchange will only continue in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” estimates Mitsušige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoši Investment Management.
This resumption of uncertainty about the future of the eurozone damages the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 o’clock, the European currency has a value of $1,3570 with a 0.4% decline.
The currency collapsed after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party adopted a proposal on Monday to leave the eurozone for countries in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates for loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning on Tuesday, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85% and the yield of Spanish 10-year bonds was 6.2%.
These tensions affecting interest rates in the southern European countries, but also in France, continue to increase concerns among market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has strongly demanded time on the markets to remedy the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning caused by the amount of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on October 27 at the eurozone summit will be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is again in a deliberate line of markets when parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The rate difference between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new record high.
Expectations for Eurozone growth figures
Statistics show that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, driven primarily by household consumption, i.e. slightly better than the expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) revised the figures for the second quarter downward to a 0.1% decline in GDP instead of stagnation.
This is the fourth quarter that worries the economists the most.
In the same period, Germany registered a 0.5% growth.
The first forecasts for the entire eurozone are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy Policy :
Facts must overcome dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balances or under emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to reflect on such deposits and a place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
There are currently 7 billion people on the planet, but demographic developments will cause the demand for electricity to double by 2050 unless we want to deprive a significant part of the world’s population of vital components of life.
At the same time, the shortage of fossil fuels will need to be addressed in order to continue to produce electricity, while not forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a topic that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not affect any of these parameters.
This is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
But this is not the case for Belgium, which subordinates its decision to the need to find some other resource capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which considers it right to build only the latest generation of power plants.
On the contrary, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name at least some countries, are continuing with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by resuming the construction of one of the power plants interrupted after the Three Mile Island power plant crash.
If the German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts it.
Berlin’s choice will be reflected in higher electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, and a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal power plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European champion in wind turbines, from which it takes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to the irregularity of the wind, which makes the CO2 emissions and prices of Danish electricity higher by 65% and 50% respectively than the European average.
On the contrary, due to our unchanging energy policy, our neighbors will pay 40% more for electricity than the French households pay.
While in a globalized economy, energy costs are a key competitive factor and a guarantee ofining industry on the national territory, French enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay as well as fundamentally do not stand against this energy, as polls show.
Recall that our country’s energy policy has enabled us to build an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 follow-up jobs.
The highly exporting sector is being followed by a large number of specialized SMEs to international markets, creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decided to leave the core, it would sacrifice a significant number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose 6 billion euros a year, which the country earns from exporting nuclear equipment and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to run for 60 years while its manufacturer’s bankruptcy was planned?
In solving the energy equation, it is necessary to admit that there is no magic source for the production of energy, even that there is no evil source.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable energy plants by the French industrial group AREVA demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is imperative to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a National Nuclear Safety Authority, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognised, have the idea of safety in their blood.
In the past 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island occurred under normal operating conditions and remained without human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama was caused by the concept of the reactor and the inexcusable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take lessons from this accident just as it did in the two previous ones.
The result of this step and the cooperation between French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and engineers is that an EPR reactor represents a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to the competitors of the AREVA Group and EDF and paving the way to seize a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the overwhelming police, courts and administrations subjected to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "a country of human rights" that France boasts.
Recently, it was the administrative harassment of foreign students that became current when the Minister of the Interior (see Libération, May 23) declared that France “needed no foreign talents, walls and waitresses.”
But so far it has rarely been dealt with from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus between the left and the right in this area.
On the right tone in 1976, Jacques Chirac gave his statement that "the 900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million immigrant workers" and on the left, Michel Rocard, when in 1990 said that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the hordes of Polish plumbers on French territory was shared on both the right and the left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity we are willing to give to immigrants.
In his agenda, François Hollande limits himself to banality, saying that joint development will enable us to solve our “immigration problem.”
This idea of immigration as a burden and problem may be valid in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published book Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, Princeton University Press, May 2011, p.
The reduction of immigration paralyses growth and harms employment.
Concerns about the impact caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less skilled, and are putting pressure on them to cut their wages.
But experience shows that in fact, immigrants are far more complementary than substitute for French workers by performing work in sectors with a shortage of workers.
Poorly qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers, and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is insufficient for job offerings.
Positive impact on wages
Just as the surgeon will have trouble working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions among French and migrants cause the arrivals of immigrants to have a positive impact on the salaries and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements would lead to a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the formation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among US Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in Europe, on average at 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, one immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (income minus expenses) of €150,000 to the public budgets for his entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his term in office, expressed his desire to do for the missing percentage of growth "with the teeth priced".
The measures used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, for despite the fact that it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it has experienced during the 20th century the tragedies of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some people might believe that in order for democracy to definitively triumph over its enemies, it will be enough to make a choice and carry it out in the most direct way possible.
It is already known from Napoleon that it was the ease of thinking.
The universal right to vote, though a necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become a “instrument of oppression” as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of departments and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been the same since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
Admitting the mistake of the Greek “yes-no” referendum will have the value of double revelation in this regard: revealing the necessity of a great return of political power, but also revealing the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought out in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic backing have shifted today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot get anything if we demand a series of national referendums, organized as necessary and disorganized.
Bianko exposed to the European absolutist monarch or a leap with his legs tied into the emptiness of the nationalist depth: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we don’t want guillotine knives, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal – we’t even know where to stop the list – because the crisis is in Europe.
In fact, it is the whole of Europe bowing before the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its inability and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe – but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
The European project of democratic sovereignty must be reinstated urgently.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debt, get rid of the government of the markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will involve decisions at the European level that cannot be made without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After we have long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today strongly demands a European economic government.
to be.
But to think so without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new blind spot.
We must take on a new stage of European building.
In order to form a republic in France, it was necessary to be “Republicans.”
Revolution in interest could not be enough.
This lesson continues.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the world chip card fair will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart Cabinet, 2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% in worldwide sales of microprocessor cards (banking cards, SIM-card phones) to more than 6 billion units.
The most burdensome is the contactless technology segment, which allows you to pay in public transportation or handle purchases simply by bringing the card closer to the reader.
This year, 460 million chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to rise further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Having long been in the trail of APEC countries, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But big chains work for two.
Carrefour has released 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
In order to increase the rate, banks need to provide their clients with them.
“Two major French companies have pledged to systematically distribute contactless banking cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first step toward the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Near Field Communication (NFC) technology is currently available in a small number of devices.
“They were late.”
"But their real boom should happen next year."
“For 2012, we estimate their worldwide sales to be 80 to 120 million units,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
The banks are preparing ahead.
Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of the test in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
Approximately 200 customers and employees’ iPhones will be equipped with a casing that allows contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its customers to pay with mobile phones touchlessly.
Terrorist front stretches from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram.
Long-standing suspicions that there are links between the Islamic Maghreb terrorist group Al-Qaeda (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria “has gained certainty” about it from now on.
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French citizens in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the bridges of connection.
After being kidnapped by AQMI members from a Niamey restaurant, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers in an operation carried out by French special forces.
After the attack, French and Nigerian investigators found several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Part
The analysis of the calls led to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria that is the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
“This is progress, but we must undoubtedly wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.”
“But it is possible.”
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is becoming increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator.
In recent months, this “support” has become more and more evident in the developments and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which now involve human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since pressured Nigeria to take into account the challenges posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Rapid success
Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Muhammad Yusufa. Boko Haram, which in the language of haoussa means "Western education is sin", approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has a rapid success.
The sect becomes politized and demands strict observance of Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters launch a struggle against the central government.
These people focus primarily on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, supporters of Boko Haram became extremely active and multiplied their attacks on police stations.
The reaction of the government is the same as usual.
The army surrounded the city and resulted in 800 deaths.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf, is arrested and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its territory in the North.
In 2010, a terrorist attack killed 80 people in the city of Jos and another in the capital, Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks the police headquarters in its first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, from now on concerns all security specialists.
Now that al-Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb has encircled Mali and Iger, and Somalis of the Al-Shabab movement operate in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said France is in a state of alert and is ready to "deliver all information".
World according to presidential candidates
In matters relating to China, Iran, or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are ahead in simplification and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, govern the world with simple or even simplifying ideas?
When you listen to the presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others have repeated blatant statements and brief guidelines on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a strong spot for Republicans.
Often unfounded slogans about China, Iran, or helping Israel are intertwining.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the Republican Grand Old Party nomination, threatened to summon the Chinese to the World Trade Organization and accuse them of “manipulating their currency,” a heated topic in America, agitated by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
Even worse, if this must involve launching a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, was almost overwhelmed by a stance that “tempered” emotions.
It required a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman, who is in the last places in electoral estimates, remains unheard of.
Picture of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will imprison Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of disappointing in his duties to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows embarrassing ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against China’s military threat as Beijing “is trying to develop nuclear capabilities” – obviously ignoring the fact that China has owned nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michele Bachmann.
They are all far from the Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy, in 2008.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and yet won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of 'boys' from Iraq, his excuses about Libya, and thus attribute to him the label of a weak man.
But the attack is not easy.
The population views the national security policy of President Obama, who removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military interventions that lead to an uproar.
And with the arguments that America needs to be reconstructed economically in order to revive its leadership, Obama is knocking to the right place.
Nord Stream, the new port for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline linking Eastern Europe directly to Russia and run along the bottom of the Baltic Sea has begun to work.
It will have to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to properly celebrate this event.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream on Tuesday, a new pipeline that will connect Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte jointly turned around the control valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
Through this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will flow to Western Europe each year through the first 1.224-kilometer pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the state of Mecklenburg-Pommern.
The second pipeline, which is to be completed by the end of 2012, will provide a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is equivalent to the total French consumption.
There is a possibility to build a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction is a victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries have protested.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany without being passed by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
All at once, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pushing Russia with threats of blocking access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed it most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
I think this is a politically sensitive topic.
Western Europe has gained greater confidence in its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But it’s at the cost of weakening Europe’s energy, as the project has created cracks between Europeans from the East and the West.
Only five years ago, Russia managed to implement its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and wealthy Western countries with high gas consumption, whose deposits are coming to an end.
“This gas pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us,” Fillon said at the opening ceremony, demonstrating how big gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles of the leaders of Gazprom present in large numbers at Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a significant technical act.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel with a concrete coat to protect it from marine vessels' anchors.
It lies on the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 meters.
During its construction it was necessary to avoid mines from the time of World War II.
“For safety reasons, a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
Measures should be taken to protect flora and fauna.
The pipeline itself is a long metal serpent weighing as much as 242 Eiffel beams, which is not interrupted by valves or maintenance stations anywhere in its entire length.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project managers rejected it when the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state-owned company permanently settle off their coast.
"In the event of a failure, we will stop the passage of gas in less than 1 minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline leaks into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, since the welding was designed to produce a leakage once every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline from the outside is carried out by a submarine robot pulled by a ship, while the interior of the pipeline is controlled by the device that circulates inside.
This cigar shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is inserted into the interior of the pipeline and is pressed with gas.
During the entire three-day journey at a speed of 3 m/s, it will provide accurate information on possible deformations of metal parts.
The gas pipeline was designed to run for fifty years without the need for any repairs.
The circulation of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
The pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom holds a 51 percent stake.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15,5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream to build and operate the pipeline.
The company is headquartered in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased all of its gas transmission capacity to the company for a five-year contract, which can be renewed.
“Gazprom will benefit from the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
The construction of the pipeline was financed by 30% shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez Group, the investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be reimbursed, as only Gazprom will bear the risk.
The pipeline runs out of the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coast with pine forests.
The valves with a height of 4.5 meters form the exit gate of the gas.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, this will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - Brand Notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to provide the joy of writing again.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular plates and its white-colored leaves that seem to have aged over time.
Moleskine, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
At the time, the Italian company Modo Modo based in Milan decided to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes on the launch of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (imitation of the skin), which is used for the surface of the benches, for example.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has restored popularity to an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is far from the covert production of the first years, when only 3,000 notes were made.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to assemble any artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook will fascinate the businessman just as much as the student or the professionals.
The image of the Moleskine notebook includes that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which originally had 12 employees, now has 100 employees and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notes to bookstores and through the FNAC store chain to small boutiques in the city centers, where he was able to promote his identity.
"We followed the spirit of the time and this need for new writing, despite the stormy development of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened the exhibition" Treatment", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also unveiled new records of the notebook reminiscent of a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop case ... The brand is expanding to a wide range of carriers.
A success that aroused envy: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed people?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
Today is the 15th week of employment for disabled people.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people with disabilities is still twice the average, 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it embarrassing?
"No, emphasizes Éric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for Disabled Employment."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, the percentage of unemployed was not twice, but three times higher."
“H, there is still a lot to be done.”
It should be said that there are still numerous obstacles to unemployed persons with disabilities before they enter work.
These are older people: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a graduate degree and of the 2.3 million college students, only 10,000 are disabled.
And lastly, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the handicapped versus 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that especially complicate the return to employment and which are “the core of the problem,” according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992 to help recruit disabled workers.
So much for the brakes.
There are still unspoken, ways of thinking that are developing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association found that surveyed managers have “a weak level of knowledge about disabled people” with “an exaggerated idea of people in the wheelchair and psychological or mental disabilities.”
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the target of employing 6% of disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures, dated from 2008, indicate a figure of 2.6%.
"We're now moving around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of the Agefiph organization tasked with collecting fees from that don't comply with the law.
This is evidenced by the number of "bounded" companies, as well as the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, which fell from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law that increased contributions created a strong pressure on, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: “What Luck”
Before the French players (Bleus) challenge on Tuesday evening (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match would bring them.
We will not go so far to write that there was an association between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the tribune of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard briefly and well reconciled.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach spoke only words of praise to his player.
“I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, and the fact that he loves his country.”
"I want to move forward," assures the French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and the national team matches, "it's the same, he apologizes."
"I'm in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
“I need to clean up my mark.”
Hazard, spared against Romania on Thursday evening because of this match against France, comes to the Stade de Saint-Denis to finally "light up".
The term “pleasure” cannot be forgotten.
Play against the Bleus, which he encouraged from 7 years old and in their victorious competitions in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
Even more so, because opposite are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)”, he recalls.
“We crucified immediately.”
"To play against them is just a pleasure."
Leekens also reminisced of “pride”.
“Glory” to win “match – holiday”.
It’s also a “proudness” to say in terms of the quality of the “neighbors” that France, a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna, has “again become a team of very high level.”
“Laurent Blanc has done a great job,” he said.
Although Belgium will be missing the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with the French to ... Brazil.
“Our little Belgians will become big,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You will be aware of this for the next matches." including against France.
Portugal is confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento begins with great optimism the barrage against Bosnia (22:00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
Both teams lacked realism.
At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.
Paulo Bento has already been seen in Poland and Ukraine.
The Portuguese football team, with whose steering line it has been since 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is 90 minutes away from luck.
There is only one match to be played and one opponent – Bosnia.
Given the result of Friday (0-0) in the hell of Bosnian Zenica, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal had more than an hour of superiority, but it was not able to give such a rare goal that would relieve him.
“It’s a good result, but it’s a risk because we didn’t score outside.”
But at home at their stunning Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced they will advance in front of a crowd that should create a boiling boiler there, even though the match definitely appears to be “very balanced,” says the optimist but brilliantly contemplating Bento.
“We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” said Carlos Queiroz.
The unresolved match in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
It can be an indecisive match for the Bosnians, who also need to score a goal.
“It’s a good result, but it’s a risk because we didn’t score outside,” Bento regrets.
“We’re going to play against a team that has great technical qualities and players with great individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenici, the Portuguese will be interested in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team from the start, so that they “do not have time to think.”
Good idea, provided that this time it turns out to be realistic.
