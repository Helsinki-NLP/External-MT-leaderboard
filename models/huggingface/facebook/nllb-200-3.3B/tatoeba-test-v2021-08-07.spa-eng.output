When we are about to die, we shall be alone. From all our earthly possessions we shall be about to depart. Earthly friends - friends who point out our position, our wealth or our social qualities - will leave us when we enter the dark valley.

Though not all will leave us. There is one who "remains closer than a brother" - One who having loved His own who are in the world, loves them to the end.
