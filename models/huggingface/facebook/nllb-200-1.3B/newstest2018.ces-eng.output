The civil rights movement issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a warning for people of color traveling to Missouri based on the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Missouri Travel Recommendation, effective August 28, 2017, urges African American travelers, visitors and Missouri residents to exercise increased caution when traveling across the state as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the state", the association said in a statement.
The NAACP stated that it had taken this action under current Missouri state laws that make it difficult to defend racist-motivated acts in court, as well as due to the conduct of law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities.
There's been a violation of civil rights.
People are being stopped by police just because of the color of their skin, they're being assaulted or killed, "said Kansas City Star's NAACP president for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We are accumulating the highest number of complaints so far".
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization to the U.S. government.
Among the incidents the organization cited were racially motivated abuse directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while traveling across the state and police detained him without charge of a crime.
The travel advisory also points to a recent statement by the Missouri Attorney General's Office that states that black drivers have a 75% higher chance of being stopped by police.
"The purpose of the travel advisory is to alert people and warn their families, friends and coworkers of what could happen in Missouri", Chapel said.
 People need to be prepared - they should carry money with them for possible bail payments or notify their relatives that they are going to travel across the country.
According to the FBI's most recent hate crime reporting program, there were 100 hate crimes in Missouri in 2015, ranking it 16th among all states.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder to sue a company for discrimination in providing accommodations or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws that allow state officials to detain people for violating the law, which the ACLU says is designed to improve racial profiling.
Travel advice is usually issued by the State Department for foreign countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family is not at peace after 12 years!
The murdered model is Sally Anne Bowman.
A Croydon native was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie at the restaurant where she worked, stabbing her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then kill her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe watching the meticulous forensic work of the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years to life for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only admitted to assaulting a minor in court, and his lawyer claimed that his client found a girl already dead lying in the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had a fatal fight that night.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming".
"She even attracted the attention of taxi drivers", he falsely claimed.
The girl was supposed to defend herself, he said, but she could not.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven a lie and she blamed him.
After Dixie confessed, he talked about his hotness and his desire for a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt so satisfied, he had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was at her ex-girlfriend's house, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie himself told the police.
He said he felt the adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth", Linda added to the Mirror.
And 12 years later, the family faces another attack by vandals destroying her grave.
It's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are so many cruel people out there digging these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there", the mother of the deceased girl, Linda, told the Mirror about the disappearance of the urn of ashes.
Linda waited for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands of dollars.
"The Czechs are neither prudent nor conservative", says Martin Ráž, who runs the Intimity boutique in Prague.
It's where you'll find the most designer and luxurious sex toys.
Including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started off quietly, like, 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a bike ride through Moravia.
One of them not only brought a bicycle but also a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
"Different moths and dolphins and everything was green and yellow and just completely different", he tells me over lunch.
His friend and another associate decided to work with the German designer of erotic toys Fun Factory, which impressed Martin, and he offered to help with marketing.
When a partner left to pursue a different profession, he replaced him.
Today, she runs a boutique called Intimity in Prague's Benedict Street, where she sells erotic accessories in the same way that luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
Why wouldn't I?
They're also design subjects.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you're all this is what you're saying at lunch?
Come on, don't be such a puritan!
The Berlin Fun Factory, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, served as the inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
They opened it in 2010, and it was a completely different concept of an erotic store than everyone here is used to.
No covered shelves, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products displayed more like a perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to think about how to conceive of the Prague store, where it should be and what it should be called.
The name Intimacy appealed to both of them.
"It's intimate, and it's kind of tender", she says.
This was followed by the purchase of an internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went hand in hand with various interior visualizations.
Eventually, the winning variant split the store into a pleasure garden and a bedroom with the Duke's bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar Štěpánová from FormaFatal.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, it didn't seem ideal because it's not on Main Street, but then again, it was a good fit for Intimacy.
It's very intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so no one is looking at the customers", praises Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a business that was different, with branded, beautiful products, in an environment where women, who are predominantly our customers, feel comfortable.
And not to be ashamed of having even entered into such a business.
When I walked into Intimacy's store a half hour ago, the streets were empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like going to a sex shop.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the sheer elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Just because there's only a female waiter in the store, doesn't mean that a man's foot isn't welcome here.
Mostly, gentlemen come here to buy presents for their girlfriends.
"Men usually don't know the right size and choose the bigger one", Martin smiles at the common mistake.
It's all this prejudice, this cliché that women need some big help, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith would choose an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Similarly, men prefer black underwear, while women tend to prefer pink.
The absolute bestseller today is a product aptly named Satisfyer.
It's got to be clear from the look on my face that I don't know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's like a clitoral stimulator without touch.
I have a teenage need to ponder with admiration the serious tone of the interpretation.
It's like it's not working.
And it doesn't actually shut down.
It's a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think it would be so well received.
It's the latest in a revolutionary line of work.
The first revolution was caused by a sea horse-shaped vibrator.
He made sure that women got more interested in designing such products.
The other was a We-Vibe couples vibrator.
He has completely broken down a taboo that some men may still hold, namely that they see erotic accessories as competition.
"There are different variations", he continues.
One engine, two engines, remote control.
That's a popular category.
During sexual intercourse, a woman can hold a controller and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, the category of fitting vibrators is a certain loser.
At least, not here.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose devices and buy classic vibrators, even though they may only use them externally.
In Western Europe, it is very popular, especially with younger customers.
What about the men?
It's hard to say if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess we should put it a little differently.
The question is, what to offer men", reflects Martin.
"We have aids for them, too, but to a limited extent". The most popular is the masturbator, in this case from the Tenga manufacturer.
It doesn't look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but "more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
They're very focused on functionality and user experience.
But in Japan, it's a whole different story.
It makes me wonder.
I thought Japanese women were very tolerant of sex toys, I object.
"That's the reality of the Internet", I'm told.
The ordinary one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic devices are more associated with women using them.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and taboo for women". Just for the record, what the Japanese brand Tenga, represented by Intimity Boutique, sells worldwide still accounts for about half of what is sold in Japan alone.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not at all rude.
On the contrary, we are a fairly welcoming nation.
Certainly not in countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical shop customer is between 35 and 50 years old and "has some experience with sex life and some accessories.
She'll come for something nice, something better, something to complement her partner's life or herself". To get her back, Martin Ráž and his business partner, Zdeněk Šebelka, make sure that each product is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go into specialties like bandages and latex, because we don't have the space for it, and it's not really in the room.
That kind of thing could be a reflection of what we're trying to target.
Which is people who were always shy about going to the sex shop because they were afraid that they'd be seen.
A lot of the products on the shelves are really nice.
This is also shown by the selection of the well-known brands represented.
Some of them have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first award was the sea horse, and it set off a change in the industry.
They started to go from cheap materials to the more health-friendly ones, and they started to produce different designs, different colors...
The good news is that some of the designs are Czech, and the popular designer is Anna Marešová.
I have to say, I'm pretty pleasantly surprised at how many people here buy those Whoop.de.doo designer things from Anna Mareš, even though they're relatively more expensive.
There are customers who come straight for Venus balls from Anna Marešová.
She did a really huge job of representing, both in the Czech Republic and abroad, exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can be done differently, beautifully, with a story.
Anna's story started as a school project.
Now it's a finished product, which is also produced in our own country.
I wanted to have control over the manufacturing process, and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Since it's not a mass production, but a small batch, it's definitely more expensive than a large batch.
I may be a little against the grain, but I think it's important to keep things moving in our country.
It could well be that in a few years we won't be able to produce anything", Anna later describes the situation, agreeing with Martin that our society is becoming more open.
He doesn't get negative or rejection.
They say people are as embarrassed as they can get.
"But then they start smiling". Currently, Anna Mareš has a vibrator on offer, which you can have a personal note made out of, and this year she's also planning her own lubricant gel.
Next year, we're gonna have more vibrating eggs and other new features.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I'm wondering where the boundaries of what's okay are.
Is there anything that Martin Rage wouldn't sell?
It's really hard to define.
What seems normal to one person may seem completely abnormal to another, so we tend to stick to a branded product range.
None of them go to extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: what was the craziest request they ever got?
Just this week, an e-mail came in asking for a masturbatory device for her six-inch-old boyfriend.
So we had to write to her and say we didn't have any of that.
"I wonder if someone was making fun of us", Martin looks at me suspiciously.
It happens from time to time.
A shot for Karl Gotta.
After two Alzheimer's!
His friend Charles the Bold is battling a serious illness.
Karl Gotha's best friend is battling a disease that will steal all people's memories.
"Yes, it is unfortunately true", confirmed the sad information to Lightning himself the singer.
I know my illness, and I'm still quite well off, given the circumstances.
"I take medication to slow down the accompanying symptoms", he added, thanking his loved ones for their support.
The whole extended family came together to make Karl's life easier.
Eva's wife tries to be at home as much as possible, and the daughters of the first marriage of Susan and Teresa are also coming to the house on the White Mountain, looking after the son of Karel called Karlas.
Gherdy had twice fought cancer and passed on his experience to Slavík to support him during his difficult treatment.
He's had 60 chemotherapies.
He was able to return to work afterwards, and to the tennis court and the ski slopes.
"The astrologer predicted that I would be here before I was ninety", Karel told Blesk.
He's a fighter.
She still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words so as not to forget them", admits Karl.
The actress Flower Violet is now in the hospital fighting the same disease.
Do you have a family history of Alzheimer's?
Watch how you treat him.
Chile's parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, the law is up to the U.S.
In Chile, abortion is still strictly prohibited, even for medical reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing in parliament for more than two years", complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and should have a new president by the end of August, who is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
The bill to repeal the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, passed the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would challenge the law in court, saying it violates the right to life of the unborn child.
Members of Parliament postponed voting on the bill last month until it was analyzed by a joint parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, the lawmakers approved the bill, and the Senate did so again.
Under the new legislative amendment, abortion should be made illegal in three cases: if the woman's life is threatened, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy is the result of rape.
Similar exemptions had existed in Chile since 1931, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, even before women were given the right to vote there in 1949.
An absolute ban on abortion was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where abortion is strictly prohibited.
Other countries include Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta, and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, some 20 women are now in prison, serving up to 30 years in prison for abortion.
In many cases, according to human rights groups, the abortion was spontaneous and the court ruled that it was murder.
Is there anything sacred about it?
The target of the Trump White House is now the Statue of Liberty
A sure sign of regime change is the criticism of the statues.
Americans could tell the story as well as anyone else - see the carefully staged toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was getting into when, in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically curb legal immigration, he went up to the Statue of Liberty with a symbolic ax.
It's worth adding that Miller didn't attack the statue as such.
He'd be lynched by a mob of cruise ship owners and Statue of Liberty impersonators.
But he attacked its significance, namely that in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, a plaque was placed on the base with the famous poem Emma Lazarus.
Miller rebuked Acosta, saying, "I don't want to get into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that shines a light on the world.
The poem that was placed on the substrate additionally and to which you refer is not part of it.
Miller is actually right, but as he said, this isn't about history.
Above all, these are the striking words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate with our times - inviting not only immigrants but the poorest of the poor: "Let the downtrodden come to me, the poor, the barely able to breathe, the poor worm in the midst of crowded cities".
And in modern times, we can watch these miserable worms on our screens better than ever.
Miller wasn't trying to criticize poetry -- he was trying to make it clear that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a larger political and cultural war: it's basically a conflict over the meaning of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends who had been trying to put a plaque with a poem on the base of the statue after her death, knew quite well that she was engaging in a high-level political game.
The statue was meant to express the union of the French and American Republican governments by representing the classic theme of women's embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female character is not abstract, but has her own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
Combining the poem with the image of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long sought to pervert that meaning.
Well-known commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist on Trump's ascension - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty actually does not take anyone to the country, but represents early neoconservatism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: The Statue of Liberty moves forward.
He's taking the torch of freedom out of the United States and offering it to the rest of the world.
The parade is not to light the way to the United States.
Limbaugh is strikingly important.
The meaning of a statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the perspective of an exhausted and damned traveler, who often arrives with hope in his heart after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean to a new land.
It's literally a look at the world through the eyes of people looking for refuge and a chance at a better life.
In this way, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will recognize.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to incite the hatred that is their only source of power.
2017 World Championships in Athletics: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls the days when the British team had only two Scottish members
UK Athletics Director Neil Black said a strong squad of 16 Scots on the World Cup team would be a "giant contribution" to the team.
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 London Olympics, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that something special is happening in Scotland and that British athletics could learn a lot from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we're going to work on it", Black said.
I've spoken to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish Athletics think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing.
Several Scottish athletes will be vying for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle has been chosen as the team captain.
Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing, said Black.
Several athletes, both Scottish and non-Scots, left the room feeling overwhelmed with pride and motivation.
The passion and the unadulterated feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable.
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, said it was "incredible" that there were 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The middle-distance runner Muir has set five British and two European records in the past year alone.
The MS will be run at 1500m and 5000m.
Another great Scot is Chris O'Hare, who runs the 1500m track and this season has won the British Team Race and the Games of the Year.
Doyle recalls her first championship, where the only other Scottish member of the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team said that she was very proud of the fact that not only did a large number of her teammates join the team, but in many cases they will also be attacking the final and the medal.
"It is unusual for me to be chosen as team captain, it was a great honour for me, but knowing that I was chosen by the team members is a great pleasure", she added.
I'm obviously very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
It proves where we've gone.
They're athletes who'll be thinking about the front seats on the podium.
And my opening remarks?
Yes, I think she did.
I just pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it's on home soil.
It's important to tap into the support of the home fans and rejoice in the fact that we're back in the Olympic Stadium.
I've got a second chance to race and I'm going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere.
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't take public office unless you can stand criticism from voters
The father of our country knew his critics.
The American people loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political views.
Yes, that criticism did not leave him cold.
But he didn't try to silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech may be taken from us - and by fools and mules we shall be led like sheep to the slaughter".
What brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on his Washington attitude.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
He was indicted this week by the American Civil Liberties Union for those actions.
The governor's staff rejected the lawsuit as unfounded, and online comments have been filled with the "who cares" type of opinions.
"It's just Facebook", many users said.
It does matter, though.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In a perfectly democratic state, this is an extremely popular Republican governor.
He boasts the second-highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not a freak.
Clearly, he runs his country with self-assurance and strict adherence to principles.
He also proved to be adept at using Facebook as his primary means of connecting with his constituents - not to mention posting his first nude photo after chemotherapy.
Blocking people from visiting the governor's website - which is a public forum, labeled as official and managed by his employees paid with taxpayer money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor by saying that the comment blocking was done from a post moderator position.
But using the image of internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people whose posts were deleted.
And that's exactly what they are -- real people talking to their elected leaders; a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls.
As everyone has stated, their comments were polite and considerate, not derogatory.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie's attorney, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md., asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I have politely noted my disappointment with his inadequate response to hate crimes and other current news", she wrote in the Washington Post's comment section.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, they are labeled by some people as promoting so-called collective efforts, instead of being recognized as a larger group of concerned citizens".
What the governor's staff called "focused interest spam" others would probably call "job-job".
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It's much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would have required sending employees out into the streets to collect and burn all copies of criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to be criticized for his disgraceful behavior on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first major regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment in Alexandria, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris, by blocking access to one of the voters on her Facebook page.
Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also received visits from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington, the low cost of postage had almost the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the daily press quadrupled in number, and its position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even back then, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under the pseudonyms "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to the newspapers challenging Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by people through the online Papers of George Washington Project, his office was piled with petitions criticizing his stance on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and intimidation lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And a true leader must accept that.
The Czechs quickly took advantage of free roaming, consuming more data abroad than at home.
The Czechs abroad consume more of their tariff than at home.
They are most common in Austria, but Croatia leads in data consumption during the summer season.
On vacation, they spend more time browsing the Internet, and they often have no access to Wi-Fi under the sun.
Beach, swimming and a smartphone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
It's based on recent statistics from the O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available as part of the package than at home.
It is therefore not surprising that in Croatia, where the winter is the least crowded, data consumption has increased by as much as 50 times this summer.
Italy came second in the ranking of data consumption.
The Czech people spend most of their time in Germany, where many travel for work and during the summer.
According to the Association of Czech Travel Agents, 800,000 Czechs visit Croatia each year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
But people here have traded the book for sharing their experiences on their mobile phones.
The record was set on July 7th of this year.
"The data transfer would contain tens of millions of photos", said Silvia Cieslar, director of mobile at O2.
Although Croatia leads in terms of data, the highest number of Czech users are in neighbouring countries.
Austria is first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is only fourth and Italy sixth.
We're going to Austria for hiking and an active holiday, which we don't have much time for browsing the Internet.
"Moreover, through Austria, the Czechs are heading for the Adriatic", Cieslar explained.
While the data operator recorded a high year-on-year growth after the release of roaming charges, the growth for telephony is much lower.
The number of minutes spent on roaming has doubled from last year.
With a huge lead over the other countries, Germany dominates.
"Roaming calls are more likely to be used by business customers on business trips", added Cieslar.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping for a homey atmosphere at the Renaissance Club.
Former golf star Ronan Rafferty will be enjoying a relaxing atmosphere over the next three days at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative region of East Lothian, which is hosting the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who hails from Northern Ireland, lost to Paul Eales at nearby Archerfield Links Golf Course on his way to the final last year, will be acting as tournament ambassador for founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow before my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty", said Rafferty.
The players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the field.
Jerry did a great job.
He's a passionate advocate of the game and proud of his accomplishments.
This year's tournament is in the right hands.
Eales, from England, will be defending his first title, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it", said the Southport golfer.
I didn't get a chance to defend my win at the Extremadura Open because the year after I won the tournament was canceled.
It's magical to come back to this part of the country.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
I remember last year, when winning meant a lot to me and my wife Sharon.
It was a beautiful time, one I will never forget.
Homecoming is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating his 50th anniversary at the end of this year.
The event will be his first appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil", Orr said of Helensburg.
You want to succeed, and you feel a lot of pressure.
I'm really happy to be playing again, and I think I'm doing well.
I'm satisfied with the results so far.
The three players will be joined on the field by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry to the tournament is free, with a parking charge of £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden hut in Paniai Enarotali, the capital of the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - nota in the local language - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, he takes out the potatoes and tastes them with his unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on muddy ground - the house is unfurnished - where she also does her daily chores, such as washing laundry in the muddy water of a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof is a toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late into the night is dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
"No one walks around the village after 5 p.m"., says Bardina.
It's a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which just 1,026 elderly people were forced to vote by a public hand-raising in front of the occupying army.
The current protest movement against Dutch rule quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region except for foreign journalists or civil rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and desolate city that you can get there in a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach-wrenching drive.
Public transportation is not working at this location.
The city of 19,000 is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, with woolly tiles in shades of gray and scarlet.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners have looked at this site.
Before the arrival of the Christians, the local people worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing these dresses", says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark T-shirt and glossy skirt.
We used to only carry paper.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and its infant mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in all of Asia.
But at the same time, it's Indonesia's land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, U.S.A., is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, home to some 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports an estimated $78 billion worth of timber extraction.
Yet, for the Papuans, this wealth is a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
An investigation by the New York Times in 2005 found that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 per officer.
The Papuan call for self-government threatens this golden goose and is therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
The mass killings in the tribal area of Papua during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes the atrocities that took place last year, including extrajudicial executions, torture - according to another report, rape and electrocution are particularly popular - and the brutal suppression of peaceful protesters.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week", said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Adding to the problem is the fact that Papua's resources are attracting settlers to Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants, 83% claim to be Christian, but the demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from Indonesia's islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a vegetable mixture with peanut sauce.
The locals are fighting for their lives.
"The immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables at traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans", explains Abeth You, 24, who was born in Paniai and moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura for work.
 The indigenous people of Papua - mama-mama (women) - lost their jobs.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised to address inequality and human rights violations during his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta in 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But in Papua, very little has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would hear our cry for justice", You said.
The fact is that only two months after the inauguration of Jakowi in October, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were singing Christmas songs at a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the night.
Two of the surprised children told them to turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was moved by the scolding and the tone of the words and later returned with four other soldiers, said local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers, while drunk, chased a group of children and beat them with their guns, victims and witnesses said.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby Election Commission building, and the next day things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered at a soccer field outside the local police station and military headquarters, demanding justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - a circle-running dance that imitates the singing of birds - of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua.
Some Protestants began throwing stones at the buildings.
As tensions mounted, the soldiers were ordered by radio: "If the mob tries to resist at least three times, you have permission to shoot", according to TIME magazine, in an official document whose contents were never released by the local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the mayor of Enarotali Kego Koto, recognized the imminent danger and urged residents to disperse to their homes.
But no one was to ignore his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist", he told TIME magazine on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he said the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting", he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him", Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told TIME magazine in a muted voice.
I saw him dead... and I kissed him.
The Papua police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were only securing the station that was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us", said in 2015 the spokesman for the Papuan police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo.
It's a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many more were injured.
The news of the murders was reported by Jakarta's media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi made a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again", he said.
In October 2016, Minister of National Security Wiranto announced that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve past acts of violence.
But almost immediately, excuses began to be made.
Most of the violence has happened a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990's and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these acts of violence, but it's not going to be an easy task", he said.
However, in a 5 June interview with TIME magazine held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he did not plan to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that all cases would be brought to trial.
Wiranto, who was charged by the UN with "crimes against humanity" for the more than 1,000 deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have been settled so far, including the incident in Paniai.
The families of the victims of the Paniai shooting greeted his claims with suspicion.
"I have been interrogated a total of four times in the last three years, but I have not received any response", Yohanes said.
I'm tired.
As he says, he's still living in fear a few years later.
I'm afraid, as he says.
I'm afraid I'll be arrested by the army or shot.
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Paniai residents who are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten up by military members after helping bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army started looking for me", he said.
And the shooting still continues.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police opened fire on villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
A fight that killed one person and injured 17 others occurred between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the building company.
According to police, villagers threw stones at the members and were responded to by warning shots.
However, local residents claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd and killed one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation", said 29-year-old Domingu Badi, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded.
I didn't leave the house for two days.
The Deiya parliament demanded punishment of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the side of the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the alienation of the indigenous Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living in the central highlands.
Many of them joined the Papua Liberation Movement (PLM), a rebel army that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In the wake of attacks in recent years, the army has arbitrarily arrested and detained thousands of Paniai residents, all under the pretext of "ensuring national sovereignty".
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known to the Papuan people as a tragic and forgotten place.
The oil on the fire is poverty.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is still out of reach.
The inhabitants of this area grow their own food, mainly sweet potatoes, fruits, and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields, each cultivating four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is for the family's needs, the rest they sell at the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are only worth 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since the opening of more air routes at Nabire Airport and the influx of new immigrants into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
So few jobs are usually filled by more educated and wealthy immigrants.
The Papuans rarely have the capital and education to start a business.
"Young people are moving out of the villages due to lack of job opportunities and money", said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Because of the isolation, Papua is hidden from the world.
The strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from Papua for "lack of cooperation with the authorities", despite receiving such a rare permit to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, said Jokowi had promised in his election campaign to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development, but that never happened.
"Foreign journalists working in the volatile easternmost areas of Papua and West Papua face a great risk of visa denial and blacklisting", he said in a statement.
The lack of coverage by foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia on the Papua issue is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate various and widespread acts of violence in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir shook off the accusations when he told reporters in Jakarta that:  Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free media, so it is difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations.
Local people are calling for foreign governments to join.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals chanted the slogan "We want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia is scheduled to hold another election in 2019, but the Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people connected to the Paniai shooting", said Gobau, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - besides living in constant fear of the marauding army - are winding down in poverty, poor education and healthcare.
Gobai claims that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote a debt to be paid to Jokowi.
"They don't want money, they want justice", he added.
Despite threats and intimidation of the families of the victims, the panic-shooters continue in their last symbolic act of resistance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the grounds opposite the police and military stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least he won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed", Yacobus said with his head bowed.
What can we do?
The French Navy has intercepted a massive shipment of cocaine bound for Australia.
The French Navy has seized a yacht in the Pacific carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth approximately $256 million.
The shipment was headed to Australia.
The raid resulted in the arrest of a four-man crew, apparently from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named Afalina, had sailed from South America and was towed by police to the port of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific.
The Australian Intelligence Service said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where the drugs came from and where they were going, and to uncover the "lithic syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped large quantities of drugs from entering Australia", said its executive director, Col Blanch.
Drugs were destroyed in Nouméa this week.
Australia is an attractive destination for their drug traffickers because of high street prices.
The country also faces the problem of a growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
This is not the first time we've been raided.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting a large quantity of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they attempted to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
The elderly don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded to drink.
The problem may be in nursing homes, and the solution, according to a doctor at the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlová, could be infusions of physiological solution, which are injected with a thin needle under the skin.
But they're only used in medical facilities.
The older a person gets, the more water in his body decreases.
"In addition, they lose their thirst, so seniors generally consume less fluid and become dehydrated very quickly", said Maddalena.
Two liters should be drunk for sure.
"But getting so much fluid into an old man is a big problem", she added.
She says that in many nursing homes, there is no doctor.
In hospitals, they usually treat dehydration with IVs.
"I think they should be introduced gradually so they can get subcutaneous infusions", she said.
She says that up to two half-liter bottles of physiological solution can be given to the elderly in a day.
Fluid deficiency can cause malaise, headache, and reduced performance.
Dehydration will manifest itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks confused", she added.
If neglected, it can lead to a stroke.
Blood clots and clogs the blood vessels in the brain, and there's a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a blanket, not more than cotton sheets.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
"It is more of a nursing challenge, but it would be ideal to occasionally uncover the patient and let the skin out", the doctor said.
The Torch skyscraper burned down for the second time in Dubai
In Dubai, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers caught fire on Friday, forcing firefighters to evacuate all residents of the 337-meter, 79-story building.
This is the second fire in the last two years at the high-rise building, aptly named The Torch.
All occupants of the building have been evacuated and there were no injuries.
We were asleep and the alarm woke us up.
It took us 10 minutes to run down from the 50th floor, Geroge, one of the residents of the skyscraper, told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defence said firefighters were able to bring the fire under control around 4am (0:00 GMT) and then resumed cooling the building.
Government officials added that they are providing alternative accommodations for the disabled.
The incident could reignite debate about the safety of materials used to cover tall buildings around the world.
The Commission also notes that the construction of the Torch skyscraper was not carried out in accordance with the requirements of the relevant legislation.
British police said that the insulation and fencing system at Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed nearly 80 people.
The survey found that more than one in five passengers to the United States carried illicit items on board
A survey of passengers found that more than 20 percent had knowingly or unknowingly brought illicit items through a U.S. government agency, the Transportation Security Administration, checkpoint onto the plane.
Less than one percent of passengers say they discovered late that they were traveling with a firearm, ammunition, or explosives.
The results of a survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which was completed by more than 1000 respondents - showed that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of respondents who admitted to knowingly trying to travel with an item that is prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were travelers with several thousand hours of flight time compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Among the most common items that have escaped the TSA's attention are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly passed a sharp object through the security guard, while 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men also admitted to intentionally bringing illicit drugs on board the aircraft.
The company stated that it had conducted a survey among passengers worldwide to determine how many of them had accidentally passed unauthorised items through airport control and how many had done so intentionally.
Not surprisingly, most people who have brought unauthorized items - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company has pointed out, TSA regulations are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what liquids and how much they can carry on board.
Not surprisingly, the TSA has seized the largest amount of prohibited liquids yet.
For a while, people thought that the TSA would treat books the same way as smuggled goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, not international.
EPA Director Scott Pruitt on the delay of the Obama administration's planned emissions reduction directives
After the EPA was sued by 15 states, its chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt has introduced changes to his plan to respond more quickly to the needs of state environmental regulators than previous administrations.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
This concerns the latest deadline set for 1 October, when States should start to implement the 2015 Ordinance on the Reduction of Ground Ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the agreement by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interference with local decisions or impending economic growth".
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed EPA chief by President Donald Trump, has long served as a staunch opponent of tighter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
Wednesday's sudden turn is the biggest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA's enforcement agency had overstepped its authority in trying to delay the inclusion of the Obama administration's plan to require oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt proposed his version of the ozone standards and reinforced EPA's commitment to working with states through complex processes and meeting new standards within a given time frame.
"Under the previous administration, the EPA often missed deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set plans", said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
We don't believe in settlement by litigation and we take deadline compliance seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes with it.
The EPA statement, however, states that Pruitt may at some point use the "possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities" to ensure that regulation "will be based on sound policy and the most available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader revision of the ozone laws.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure still hasn't passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group is not going to allow it under legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal of opinion - following our court filing - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution", Schneiderman added.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C. The city was the capital of the United States.
Ground-level ozone is formed when common harmful substances emitted by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants, and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health and environmentalists are welcoming Pruitt's sudden change.
"It's worrying how much pressure we need to put on the people responsible to change the way we think and protect the air we breathe", said Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological drive of the Trump administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests".
He's burned a man with acid, yet the court says he's not dangerous.
You never know what might happen.
One minute you're home with your family, laughing, the next, your whole life is turned upside down.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
Similarly, Andreas Christopheros, in the United Kingdom, was acid-stained by an unknown assailant and eventually exonerated.
The information was reported by Reuters.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the Christopheros' door.
Andreas got up to go open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier outside the door to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, he was in for a cruel surprise.
A man he'd never seen before in his life, immediately after opening it, without warning, sprinkled acid on it, saying, "This is for you, buddy".
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell off like nothing, and I felt nothing but incredible pain on my skin", said Andreas.
His family rushed him to the hospital, but there they learned the terrible news - doctors said he had no chance of survival.
For weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injuries were very serious.
Of the 90 percent, the face was affected, which doctors were trying to repair using skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A major complication for Christopher was the loss of his eyelids.
It's probably the most torturous thing I've ever been through.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes", he described his anguish.
Today, Christopheros has completed 12 operations, far from his last.
According to plastic surgeons, injuries sustained by acid attack victims may require hundreds of surgeries and years of treatment.
Even after long and difficult treatment, victims have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and struggle with deformity and deformity throughout their lives", said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is certain that the unknown man must have mistaken him for someone else.
The offender believed that he was avenging the man who had sexually abused his loved one.
The police investigated the case thoroughly and tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
Later, however, to the astonishment of the Christopheros family, the verdict was overturned.
"The three judges finally concluded that the sentence should be lifted because the man is not considered a threat to the public", Christopheros said.
In recent years, the number of attacks with corrosive substances has increased dramatically.
The Interior Ministry there has spoken out on the issue by planning to issue new guidelines to prosecutors regarding the classification of gravel.
They should be classified as dangerous weapons.
But victims of such attacks are not going to give up.
They demand that the UK government impose tougher and longer prison sentences on people who attack their neighbourhood with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also demand that controls be tightened on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different shops, as they are different detergents.
In the United Arab Emirates' largest city, Dubai, the famous Torch skyscraper, one of the world's largest residential buildings, burned down last night.
According to Dubai Civil Defence, the occupants of the 80-storey building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
A spokesman for Dubai Police said the fire started on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
According to several residents of the house, it was the other way around.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us", said one of the tenants.
Another tenant, quoted by Reuters, said the fire broke out on the top floors and spread downward with the hot debris falling.
We were asleep.
The alarm woke us up, people were screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, taking about ten minutes from the 50th floor", described the tenant, George.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the flames had engulfed about 40 apartments.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars as they were hit by burning parts of the building.
After about two hours, the fire was brought under control, according to a statement from the Civil Defense.
The cause of the disease is not yet known.
Witnesses in the surrounding buildings said the power went out.
A massive fire also damaged Dubai's The Torch skyscraper in February 2015, destroying over 100 apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the whole building.
No one was hurt either, as the residents were evacuated in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and at 352 metres (1,550 ft) it became the tallest residential building in the world.
The record was broken the following year by another skyscraper in Dubai.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his system.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the Corriere della Serra, the sample of 23-year-old Ippolito contained a wide variety of illicit substances - from steroids to diuretics to medicines for Parkinson's disease and anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix didn't help him win the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder faces a four-year suspension and criminal charges.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, a record number for athletes caught.
The third-league player, he said, started taking steroids the year before, when he failed bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She was hugging her ex-lover passionately!
Lucka Vondráčková has barely set foot on Czech territory, she's in one cycle.
And he's also a draw wherever he goes.
Last time she was in her arms was her ex-lover, Michal Long, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older and already longed for a family.
At only 19 years of age, Lucia had no desire to hang up her career.
They parted, but remain friends to this day.
Which they also proved at TV Prima's press conference, where they met after a long time.
They just happened to match the blue color.
They didn't notice each other at first, but then they got closer and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes until she grabbed her belly.
Then they hugged and posed for photographers.
Their meeting was no accident, however, as they play a couple in Prime's new series Captain Exner.
Islamists got life in prison in Britain for plotting an assassination.
A British court on Thursday sentenced four members of an Islamist cell called the Three Musketeers to life imprisonment for plotting a terrorist attack against the police and army, according to prosecutors.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
The authorities then believed that he was about to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a semi-finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions meaning "infidel" in Arabic, and a model pistol.
It happened at the same time that an MI5 agent was installing a wiretap device in the car.
"The recent assassinations have shown the terror that could be caused by the defendants if they were not stopped", said Deputy Prosecutor Sue Hemming.
Three convicts, aged 28, 25 and 33, can apply for parole after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
The men, at their trial in London, claimed they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car had been planted by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendants' arguments.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
The temperature in Hodonín was 38.3 degrees.
Tuesday's record temperature of 37.3 degrees remained at its peak for just two days.
With the 38.3 degrees recorded at the Watchtower in Hodonín, it was surpassed on Thursday, making it the hottest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
But Thursday didn't have many record highs compared to Tuesday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or matched at 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
Only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures on Thursday.
For example, the temperature in The Watchtower on Thursday was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In Břeclavsk, the temperature of Thursday's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, like The Watchtower's, were from 2013.
It was ten degrees cooler in the west.
High temperatures were observed on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Guard, the hottest was in Dyjakovice in Znojemsk and Brodë nad Dyja in Breslau, where the mercury rose to 37.8 degrees, but did not exceed the record.
In contrast, according to the Czech Health Ministry website, Thursday's highest temperatures in western and northwestern Czechia were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there have only started to rise this late afternoon", the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and more heavy rain could come on Sunday.
In most parts of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in southeastern Moravia on Saturday.
China is short of tourists.
Beijing is losing billions to the visa policy.
For decades, China has sought to exert its influence without the use of force.
They spend ten billion dollars a year to support language schools and to build universities abroad, push their entertainment industry into foreign markets and try to attract Western tourists.
Beijing is not doing that.
State media there are talking about plans to make tourism a driving force for economic transformation and modernization.
However, arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
This is partly because, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, says economics professor Christopher Balding of Peking University in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for itself is China's visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free access to China, and citizens of the other countries must apply in advance.
So the crowds at Chinese offices in the United States are comparable to Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait in line for hours, you'll have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study in the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors to a country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than 3 percent of China's gross domestic product and less than 1 percent of its population, had 1.8 million Americans visiting.
China often exacerbates the problem itself by using tourism to further its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted traffic to South Korea in the spring as part of the dispute over South Korea's anti-missile system, the South Koreans retaliated and China avoided.
In May, visits fell 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw an 85 percent increase.
All of this is affecting macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report by the U.S. Federal Reserve, Chinese travel abroad could cost China as much as $190 billion, while China would make about $35 billion a year by selling foreign currency to incoming tourists.
According to official balance-of-payments figures, China had a tourism deficit of $217 billion last year, or 44 percent of its total trade surplus.
Thus, a small number of tourists inflict a very painful blow on a country that is anxiously preventing capital from flowing.
However, the above factors are only one manifestation of a more general aversion to foreigners.
In many parts of China, immigrants were virtually unheard of.
In 2013, there were less than a million foreigners living in China.
There are more in the United States and in some cities.
Even Japan, which isn't exactly a crossroads of immigration, has double that.
A number of studies have shown that immigrants tend to stimulate economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
But you can't find them in China.
It will be politically difficult to solve these problems, but the step that is being proposed is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, notably India and Vietnam, have recently made a major effort to simplify and reduce the cost of visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
The Plzeň Zoo has been breeding deadly poisonous reptiles.
The Pilsen Poison Kingdom can now enjoy the young of three rare, deadly reptiles.
So far, visitors will see only all nine newborn Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at 2,000 meters above sea level.
"It grows to a length of several feet", described Martin Vobruba, a spokesman for the zoo.
Meanwhile, the young of the other two species, the Deathbomb and the Red Cobra, will be gathering strength in the garden's breeding grounds.
We can't say when people will see them.
"We don't want to lose them", said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.
Eight Australian Death-bearers have been born, descended from a breeding pair originally from a population in the Sydney area.
"The only one that visitors can see in the exhibition is a Death Carrier from the Perth area", said Vobruba, who said that in human care, the Death Carrier must winter for six to eight weeks at 13 degrees Celsius.
The 100% success rate was accompanied by a swarm of African spitting cobras.
A couple at the Plzeň Zoo hatched four eggs, giving birth to four young.
"The incubation lasted 65 days", Vobruba added. "It was a very long time.
In the wild, this species injects venom at a distance of up to four meters.
It's aimed at the eyes, can cause permanent blindness.
The young of all three species feed on mouse fungi at the zoo.
The young are expected to hatch in the garden for 40 days from the black mamba's brood, and the eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to the unverified transcript of the phone call, Trump is pressuring Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post has published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with top officials from Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The US president accused him of publicly condemning the wall, reportedly saying: "You can't talk like that in the press".
Trump's campaign promised to build a wall along the southern border, and he said Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has also been leaked, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the deal to monitor the US for refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which was made under President Obama - he would look "dope" after proposing a ban on refugees entering the US.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that this was the most unpleasant call of the day.
Tusk has testified again at the prosecutor's office about Smolensk.
"He has nothing to fear", declared the brother of the dead president, chairman of the ruling Law and Justice PiS party, Jaroslaw Kaczyński, to Tusk.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not scare me", Tusk replied, blaming the current leadership for trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
As he left the Prosecutor's Office, a crowd was waiting for Tusk, according to TVN 24, chanting Donald Tusk! and wishing the politician 100 years!.
Tusk thanked him for his support and assured him that his conscience was clear: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intimidate me".
He says he doesn't blame the prosecutors, but he does not doubt that the judiciary is meant to serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against rivals, the opposition or people they don't like, and I'm afraid I belong to that group.
That's the second time he's been questioned.
The former prime minister was questioned at the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time the question was about the autopsy mistakes of the victims of the accident.
Additionally, the bodies were confused in the coffins.
Families were forbidden to open coffins, and there must have been a reason.
And the reason was that they were afraid of scandal, because it would strain Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, was supposed to serve to make Donald Tusk someone very important in the EU", Kaczyński claimed on Catholic television Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would ruin Tusk's chances of winning the most important seat in the Union, which Poland has absolutely nothing to gain from.
Kaczyński also said that he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things could go differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take notice.
Tusk was interrogated for eight hours by the prosecutor's office on April 19.
Even then, he wasn't a suspect, only a witness.
However, many considered his summons to interrogation as part of an apparent attempt by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
The Prosecutor's Office is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who acts as the Prosecutor General.
The summons came shortly after Tusk was elected President of the European Council, which Kaczyński had tried hard but in vain to prevent, including during Merkel's visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydłowa protested alone against Tusk's extension.
In this case, even Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw in the lurch.
Burma and Senegal.
Where else can Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the House from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
It's from the ordinance that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The State Department has prepared an update, currently in the comment process.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
The Ministry explains that the measures are intended to reduce the number of persons who are subject to the measures.
"In some countries, new representative offices have been created, some offices have been closed, or the level of representation has changed", the material says.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the representative offices to which paper ballots are supplied.
This group of authorities includes the Czech Republic's representation in the neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than 100 other Czech authorities will receive a press release.
They're just changing their list by decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote at the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassies are closed today.
The Czech Republic also cancelled its representation in Bamako, Malaysia and Kyoto, Japan.
He won't even vote at the general consulate in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
New ones are on the list at the embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, Dakar, Senegal, and Lusaka, Zambia.
In Asia, the Czech Republic has since the last parliamentary elections expanded its representation by adding a consulate-general in Irbil, Iraq, and Chengdu, the capital of China's Sichuan Province.
Voting cards will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to elect their deputies in polling stations at parliamentary offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the State Election Commission draws lots to determine the district for which candidates are to be voted abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when the South Moravian candidates were decided.
In the following two elections, Czechs abroad voted among South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, as this year, the Central Bohemian Region was selected.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, up from about 6,700 in 2006, and 8,222 four years later.
For the early parliamentary elections four years ago, 10,571 voters turned up at the embassies.
The Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists remembered the racist lynching
A 1948 Mercury Ford passed by the onlookers of Monroe, Georgia, and curved toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, however, a group of white men with guns blocked its way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - longed to smoke and glanced at the windshield of his car.
Inside, the passengers were trembling with fear.
"We want that asshole and Roger!" the man shouted.
Bring him to me!
Silence interrupts the screams of a young black man being pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is a mere reconstruction of the events of July 22.
But when one of the men throws a screw over Roger's neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, Moore's Ford Bridge has been regularly visited by a group of activists who are reconstructing that fateful night in 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Ku Klux Klan.
No one's ever been tried for murder.
"It's strange that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity", said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to organize the reconstruction of the event.
It's a stain on our history and a burden on our souls.
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the events presents a dramatic challenge to action, and each year he reminds the Monroe community that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand prosecution and closure, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice first", Brooks said.
Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin.
A coroner covering one of the bodies of the lynching victims at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were involved in the lynching.
However, no one has been prosecuted so far.
Although the suspects remain at large for decades, civil rights advocates say both the political and the sexual motives of the lynching were known to all the townspeople.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court granted blacks in Georgia the right to vote in elections scheduled for the summer.
And just in time for the summer election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester during a brawl - allegedly for his wife.
According to Brooks, it was a town tradition that Hester had slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and had brought her into a different state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the then prominent white landowner, Loy Harrison, posted bail for Malcolm for $600.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and his cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their way back from prison, just before the entrance to Moore's Ford Bridge, they were blocked by a group of suspects.
As it turns out, the murders were planned and orchestrated by Harrison, who was being led by the FBI.
"It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement, who not only participated in the lynching, but also disposed of evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses".
Brooks was more concise about the whole thing.
"It was a massacre for the right to vote", he said.
"The murders had a clear undercurrent for all the local black people: 'This is what you'll end up with if you register and go to vote.'
The annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge event has been organized by Cassandra Greene for nearly a decade.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and poignant, revealing a deep-seated racism that many would like to see extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn't easy, and it's even harder to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hidden in all of us", said Greene.
But we can't have a relationship unless you hear what I've been through.
The main rehearsals for this year's reenactment began in June, and on the very first day, about 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - were packed into a room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is taking over as assistant director.
He's played the leader of the Kuklux Klan for many years, but he says the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it goes against who I am", Marbaugh said.
I think it's very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to go back to that time.
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm, as well as Barnett Hester, are rehearsing their roles.
The show begins with a fight - Malcolm gets into a fight with Hester and accuses him of sleeping with his wife.
Get off my property!
Rascon is not working.
There's a fight.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) will burst out laughing.
Greene is the laughing type.
What happened? He asks Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No", Greene says with a smile.
I just don't think white people said "r" in that tone back then.
That's right, one of the black actors is gonna bust out.
You need to put more emphasis on R.
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces the feeling of closeness.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to make it happen after four victims of the massacre.
The actors are rehearsing the scene.
Rascona emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the N word this time.
Now no one laughs.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The screams, the shots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings the sad song "Strange Fruit" by Billie Holiday.
With every word, there's a sadness in the room.
In the background, a dozen or so onlookers sweat and shed tears.
There's practically the same number of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple had come all the way from Ithaca, New York, and many of the spectators were from the surrounding area.
Each of them endures the local humid climate for nearly eight hours, and Brooks leads them in a procession to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up until now, the murders could have been viewed with distinction, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is terrifying.
With the last words of the song, Greene challenges the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Kids kneel at the victims' heads, watch fake blood and still bodies, and whisper in their ears.
They're not dead, they're dead little boys.
It'll be a few minutes before Greene thanks the audience.
The actors are cleaning the rope and wiping their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kuklux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two fellow actors and cries in their arms; eventually, emotions overwhelm him.
"It's all right", whispers one of the women.
We know you're against the role.
But you had a reason.
Later that day, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple enthusiastically discuss the performance of a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could hardly find words to express her feelings about today's performance.
"It's hard to listen to the ugly words and watch the ugly acts... that people who look like you do because they look like you", she told the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a hot topic", she added, "it's just called police fighting".
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in the courtroom enjoying dinner while talking about civil rights.
He's already started planning shows for next year, according to his own words.
"Recording these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it's also a moment for reflection", he said.
If we don't learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study their country's history are doomed to repeat it.
I love the instructions.
A friend of mine says that only a coward reads the instructions.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It's one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
I'm nostalgically reminiscing about a time long ago when instructions for using anything were rather a rarity.
For example, my first phonograph had only one piece of paper, and it had hieroglyphics on it that showed the connections of some parts, all of them with some secret markings.
When something inside me broke down years later, I offered that card to a shaman who wasn't afraid to screw the backboard off.
He gave me a nasty piece of advice about what the labyrinth paper was for.
Yes, it was a common tool for chronic toilet paper folding.
He found the untied wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl records again.
The new age has brought new guidelines.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where the sliced grapefruit simply clings, required about ten pictures.
Particularly illustrated was a sketch describing how to insert one piece into another.
The arrangement was two-part, and there was no other way.
Turning it upside down required considerable effort, with the need to break up certain plastic parts.
My disregard for the instructions ended with my Seat Leon self-driving car.
The year 2003 also had a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, including the replacement of the blinker.
It was easy.
Three steps and the job was done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual neglected to mention that while the light bulb on the right was going to change in really only three steps.
One, take the cover off.
Two, screw out the broken bulb and screw in a new one.
3rd, take the cover.
The light bulb on the left had a problem locating the battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the car, I would be able to use a spring, a screw, to move the cover easily and then follow the author's thrifty service book, paragraphs 1 to 3.
The wrong bench.
There was no room in that shed, no room even for Cinderella's thin hand, let alone the fat Slezan.
I've wasted half an hour of my life, and it's all to no avail.
The condition was further strengthened by my wife's entrance into the garage, evoked by the screams and words she hears from my mouth in a most unusual way.
"What are you doing here?" she asked, unceremoniously.
My reply took about 90 seconds, but if I omit the vulgar terms, there are only two words left to publish.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why are you taking so long?" she ventured, which may be her last in a long-term relationship.
I slowly explained the problem to her, with the main emphasis on the torture procedure of the author of the manual, where the request with a burning iron on the hand that wrote the manual, after it was melted, so that he could never write anything again, was merely an introduction to the wide range of Hammer's instructions for witches, including his commissionary burning on the hill above Losin Castle.
"How about disassembling the box?" the woman said, disassembling the battery.
In sheer desperation, it happened, and then step 1 to 3 was as easy and as quick as the right-hand side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
Until one day, I got a call from a colleague who was recovering from a collapse after checking on two DEA officials.
I know him as a well-balanced colleague who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field and who can tell even wild stories in an unemotional voice.
"Imagine I got a ticket for not putting up the hand washing instructions", he told me in a faint voice.
I gradually got the whole problem out of him, which was that he didn't have a hand-washing instructions above the patient's toilet.
His argument to the commissioner that adults can usually wash their hands and that no pictograms are needed to handle the usual activities of decent people had no healing effect and cost him considerable money.
"It's not just that", she told him.
He understood that simply washing soapy hands with running water is a primitive act at the cro-monnon level, that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ritual in ten steps.
Then it's necessary to tell them that the water needs to be drained.
The whole process has eleven points, but at the end of it, the happy finding is that the person washed his hands exactly as the hammer of the SUKL commands.
Finally, I must point out that I have been inspired and am preparing a detailed plan of action for the toilet.
The procedure is uniform for defecation, there is no problem, and for urination, due to certain differences between the sexes, it will be necessary to hang instructions two.
The problem remains with the pictograms, because to create a perfect procedure also means to draw all the anatomical details accurately, which could cause a certain amount of outrage to the prudish visitor to the toilet, despite finally finding out that he has been drilling the hole with the wrong procedure all his life.
Pearson is laying off 3,000 more employees and cutting dividends in an effort to revive business.
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program aimed at changing its business model.
The next wave of layoffs, which according to CEO John Fallon will occur at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, follows the company's previous decision to lay off 4000 employees in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another £300 million ($394 million) in May as part of its third cost-cutting programme in an effort to revive a declining business due to the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said its outlook for the year remained unchanged after reporting a 1% increase in core sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, NATO said.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh urban district.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack, killing more than 30 people in an explosion at a Herat mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that the explosion on Tuesday came after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, were attacked by a local man with a homemade explosive device.
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are out of danger and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to intelligence, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a major source of concern for NATO-allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia district.
The Taliban has joined the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US forces overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops that should be deployed to assist military and police forces in the country.
According to the report, the suicide attacks, which have been carried out in recent weeks, have been shaken by public confidence in the government, its decrees and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA reconsidered its decision to move the smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reversed its decision to delay the Obama administration's law that ordered states to reduce emissions, just one day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to move forward the 2015 Ozone Standards at midnight on Wednesday, saying it was presenting the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will listen to their views", EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA is seeking to delay ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, set limits that must be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 from most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit Tuesday, arguing that the EPA's actions were illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to avoid many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - in Trump's words, in an effort to kick-start economic growth.
But the new government's efforts have sparked backlash from Democrats and conservative groups concerned about the public health impact of emissions.
The EPA states on its website that breathing ozone-containing air "may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Drummer was hit and bleeding!
This singer, who is relatively new to us, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this singer, who is almost unknown to us, organized a monstrous event in the Czech Republic, which was hosted by such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Biła, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was moderated by none other than Leoš Mareš.
The idea was simple, to show the public and present their music video for Sara, whose baptism was attended by the aforementioned personalities.
Few people know that the video shoot itself, which took place in Russia, was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnar himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian National Ballet, and it wasn't without a lot of fuss.
Sara's song is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramatic scenes, the singer's juice was supposed to be a punch in the video.
At one point, however, the blow struck so hard and so directly into the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was morning, I didn't expect it, immediately I had a nosebleed", Ladislav commented on the situation.
The situation on the set was considered by the colleagues and producers to be an unfortunate accident and Ladislav failed to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury wasn't so severe as to interfere with the continuation of the filming.
We're bringing you the video of the young artist, and you can also see the punching scene.
The blood version, however, was not preferred.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko have spoken at a meeting about the possibility of a duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing match in history, met for the first time at a meeting on Tuesday.
They were each in separate rooms at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, came down to the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's featherweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime bout, both boxers made the top five in the lightweight division.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck with that.
Lomachenko is defending her title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN Saturday at 7:00 p.m.
The boxers are posing for photographers, and Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing match would be "a perfect test".
"I'm a former champion in the featherweight division", adds Garcia.
I've gained weight because of the match with Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small at 63 kg.
I'd like to get back into the lightweight division.
Lomachenko needs to gain weight again to get to lightweight... then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Why not fulfill them?
The little girl agrees.
This fight would be good for boxing.
Lomachenko is scheduled to make his lightweight debut later this year and next year will face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in a match against Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete for the lightweight title at the Forum on September 23.
"The game should be pay-per-view, that's what the fans are asking", said Garcia, who later said he was open to the possibility of broadcasting the game through the television station that comes up with the best offer.
We're the main attraction.
No one else is attracting that much attention.
We wait for the right moment...
Garcia said he recognizes Lomachenko as a great boxer and he could be in his fight on Saturday.
Lomachenko didn't hesitate to hear Garcia's praise when he said that the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're calling yourself a knockout".
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers have indicated that they feel an increasing tension before the duel.
You won't forget this game.
No other match has attracted so much attention.
And I'll be happy to add to the fire, said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for the best fighters and this is Mikey".
It's going to be a great game.
A young couple vanished without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was just found at the bottom of the Volga.
Two young Russians, Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasov, have been missing since December 2005.
A large-scale search was launched for them, but without success.
And the police eventually closed the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the missing couple lived in fear that they would never find out what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the whole story came to a sad end.
The wreckage of their car was found by a secular diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the city of Cheboksary, Chuvash.
Only the IDs left in the car allowed the police to identify the couple.
The documents survived a decade underwater, without them it would have taken the police much longer to identify the finds.
The couple was last seen when Zhirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his find to the Cheboksar police, who hauled the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe the young couple's death was an accident caused by a frozen road leading down the river.
However, the investigation is ongoing and further details will be made public once it is concluded.
The latest results of the tests to establish the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new method of assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people were questioned as being over 18 years old, but not everyone trusts their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) started new tests earlier this year.
The aim of the method is to assess applicants more accurately in the context of the assessment of asylum applications. e measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases for investigation and the Forensic Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were assessed as over 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency determined that the respondent was 'possibly over 18 years of age'.
In a further 423 cases, it was decided that the respondent was 'possibly under 18 years of age'.
Tests shall only be taken if the age of the respondent is in dispute.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results are consistent with the previous month.
"Compared to last month, the statistics are holding steady and the numbers are very similar", he told The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that the 'interviewee was 18 years of age or older'.
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent said he would be 18 this year.
The medical method of determining age, which includes wisdom teeth X-rays and MRI scans of the knee joints, which are then evaluated by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized.
One skeptic is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, which studies, among other things, the biological maturity of people to determine when they have gone through puberty.
I've had reason to think about this issue, and I don't think these types of measurements for age are right.
The assessment of biological age is in a sense very uncertain.
If we can't determine the age with precision, we shouldn't pretend otherwise, he told the Metro.
Agency's GÃ¶ransson forensic medical agency defended the decision by saying: "Generally speaking, the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the person interviewed is just under the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 per cent of all interviewees.
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
In a phone call in January, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto that he would not meet with him if he publicly said his country would not pay for the construction of a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that funding would be arranged, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump spoke similarly openly to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to transcripts of the interviews published Thursday in The Washington Post.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border with Mexican money one of his main campaign promises last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Trump undiplomatically rebuked Peña Nieto for criticizing his wall-building plan.
He described his southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't tell the press that", Trump repeatedly said in an interview on January 27th, threatening to cut off contact with the Mexican president if he continued to issue defiant statements.
They say the financing will come up somehow and it'll work out.
"But if you're saying Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you guys anymore because that's unacceptable to me", Trump said, according to the American daily.
He said the wall was the least important thing we're talking about, but politically it's probably the most important thing.
The executive order for the wall was issued by Trump shortly after he took office.
Mexico's refusal to build or finance the 2,000-mile-long wall has strained relations between the two countries.
In late March, Trump said the project would be funded by the United States for now.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's phone call with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
He was led to this conclusion by an exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States taking in people from detention facilities in Pacific island states.
Trump thought the deal was stupid at first, but he later agreed to it.
"You can certainly say this is not the deal you made, but you're going to have to stick to it", Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost cheesy, such as when Trump praised Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me", Trump joked.
But suddenly the tone of the conversation was sharp.
"I hate to admit these people", Trump remarked.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail.
"They're not going to be great people who go to work for local dairies", he said.
He also pointed out in the interview that a fugitive could become a Boston bomber in five years.
Trump conducted telephone conversations with a number of world leaders in late January, about a week after he arrived at the White House, often several in a single day.
Turnbull's call ended up being the least pleasant of the day.
Before he finished, he mentioned that he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed the killer Rana in front of a crowd.
Her father was watching.
The execution took place in the square of the capital of Yemen, Sana'a.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose a little girl named Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has affected a country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a crowd of thousands who had gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father expressed his feelings to the media after the execution.
I feel like I'm born again.
I'm relieved to hear that.
It's a new day in my life.
Other family members were present, joining the crowd in shouting "Long live justice".
The assailant was brought to the square by a police van from which he was dragged.
The cops tied him up and put him on his stomach.
One of the officers turned his gun on him and opened fire from close range.
The crowd celebrated every morning that was lit.
Mr. Almatari told MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have prevailed", he added.
I stood in San's Liberation Square waiting for the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ranina's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into a hateful frenzy, the killer would be caught and executed.
The execution was ordered by a court run by the Shiite Houthis.
Originally, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes after his arrest, but his act caused such outrage that the judge decided to impose the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on June 27.
Ran's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his house, they discovered evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could be his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to the Wound.
"Our family has no enemies and the wound that was on Ran's body was terrible", he told the media.
"The wound disappeared in the afternoon, the very day we reported it to the police, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her picture were hanging everywhere", he continued.
Everyone believes that the police got a tip from the parents of the murderers who suspected their son of a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
She used to go out to play with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10 or 15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took their cars and drove around, but we looked for nothing.
Yemenis were disgusted by the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al-Maghrabi was being held, demanding immediate punishment.
A Justice Department official read the record of the investigation to the crowd to reassure them.
The accused apparently had no remorse for his actions.
Just before the execution, the police read the sentence to him, but the condemned man looked at his executioner with a blank stare.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but a lot of footage was made available online by the crowd.
The governor of West Virginia has announced a change of party.
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at President Trump's rally that he was switching parties.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their back on me", said Governor Justice.
"Today, after much prayer and reflection, I announce... "to you as a citizen of West Virginia, "that I can no longer support you as Democratic governor.
The crowd burst into joy.
"I'm running for the Republican nomination tomorrow", Justice added.
As coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game.
Trump has already promised people at a rally in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who Forbes magazine says is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and owns several coal mines.
His net worth is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night, saying, "The overthrow of Governor Justice is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is putting obstacles in our way instead of doing anything to lift our country up".
"For the Democratic Party, which has only 15 governors and controls the fewest legislative bodies in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is the last straw for an already fragile party without a leader who is desperately trying to find a positive and unifying message", RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "sincere apology" for the doping scandal
Former top athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia for its sincere apology for the doping scandal on Thursday, but reiterated that the time had not yet come for Russia to return to the world of sports.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF congress - held on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics - that his country's expulsion from the world of sport was right and that he is determined to fight doping.
He apologized to all the athletes who lost their gold and silver medals in this way.
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into effect in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found that Russia had been promoting doping among its athletes.
"I think we've seen very honest responses and presentations today", IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All members of the Council and the Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia had admitted its mistake and was working with all its might to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire Federation".
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia had adopted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today was a great success and we've moved on to the next stage, but Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis team to maintain the sentence imposed on Russia", Coe added.
In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our goal has always been to separate the honest athletes from the dishonest ones", he concluded.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which begins Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under the neutral flag, having met the strict rules of the IAAF.
IAAF emergency chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before it can be reinstated.
Drug tests are still inadequate and the coaches who were suspended continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF board's presentation.
The State contract was awarded to the company František Savov, who is being prosecuted by the State.
The public contract of the state export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta Františka Savova.
Officials gave him a score of 100 on all the quality criteria.
They didn't mind that the Czech state was prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and requesting his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade's Export Agency CzechTrade awarded a four-year contract for the provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal in April.
The contract worth a total of CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the publishing house of the young front of entrepreneur František Savov.
The Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are pursuing him for desertion.
Savov has fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is seeking his extradition.
The case was brought to the attention of the Actuale.cz server.
According to the original criteria, the award of the contract was to be decided on the basis of 60% of the bid price and the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion was particularly helpful for Savov's company.
According to Dotyk.cz, it received 100 points in all sub-criteria.
This was what eventually pushed her to the next candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with an amount of CZK 404 900 per month, the VLM offered CZK 324 350.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received below average ratings from the judges in all qualitative criteria, with a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by the consultancy BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like the Aktuálně.cz server, is owned by Economia.
VLM has raised several objections to the tender result, arguing that its assessment was unfair and insufficiently justified.
Following their rejection, it was decided to challenge the competition at the OHIM.
It considers that CzechTrade acted in breach of the law.
'The tenderer is of the opinion that the contracting authority has reached the decision to select the contracting entity on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favouring the participant Mladá fronta, a.s., to the detriment of the tenderer and other suppliers,' reads the opening proposal submitted to the OHIM this week, published by the Actualidad server.
According to VLM's Director General and Chairman of the Board, Michal Klimy, the scores of the selection committee appear to be unbelievable and a 100% assessment of the Young Front project by all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Any independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious", he told Aktuale Klima.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
CzechTrade does not, in principle, comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All the information about the contract you mention is published in accordance with the law in the Profile of the contracting authority and in the Procurement Bulletin.
"After the contract is completed, a full written report will be published, but during the contract period we cannot comment on its progress", said the agency's media representative Štěpán Dlouhý for Dotyk.cz.
The Young Front responded by stating that it considers it extremely problematic that Economia publishing house intervened with an article in Aktuálně.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in the above-mentioned article.
The fact that she had provided editorial services to BusinessInfo for the previous four years helped her in the tender.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet received any information from the GOC on the measures taken by the GOC.
Františka Savova blames the police for tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions by his company, which caused the Czech state an alleged damage of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for his extradition since 2014.
According to Savov, the leader of the ANO movement, Andrej Babis, who controls Mafra publishing house, is behind his criminalization.
A London court rejected Savov's appeal against extradition last year, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any information from the United Kingdom on the acquisition of the legal force of the judgment so far", said Štěpánka Zenklová, spokeswoman for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, to Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to being a member of the Young Front, Savov was involved in Harvestor Limited, a Cyprus-based company that controlled the Samson Czech-built brewery, and in Maraflex, a Cypriot company that is profiled as an investment fund that buys vulnerable assets.
He's also supposed to control the failing Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov has also been linked to the seizure of assets from the former Socialist Youth League.
The biker was riding the sidewalks and the park, and he ended up in the wheelbarrows.
The biker caught attention by ruthlessly riding the streets, sidewalks and park trails in Úšovice.
When the patrol started to chase him, he decided to run away towards the Station.
"Police officers were following the man with increased caution through the city when he lost control of his motorcycle on one of the side roads behind Mariánské Lázně and crashed into the field", said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
A rescue helicopter was also flown to the accident, transporting the injured motorcyclist to a hospital in Plzeň.
Later, police discovered that the motorcyclist did not have a driver's license, the license plates on the motorcycle were stolen, its production number was erased, and the production label itself removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is the subject of further investigation.
"The breath test was performed at the scene to rule out the presence of alcohol in the driver, but the test was positive for methamphetamine", the police spokesman added.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting the funding of European football clubs will not affect Neymar's record move from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris Saint-Germain, France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid a total of EUR 222 million just to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will be demanding a salary of tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are several financial terms to Neymar's move to France.
Since PSG is financed by a wealthy Qatari family that has made a fortune selling energy, they can afford to bring Neymar into an already star football family.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid to the airport services agreement with the airport services agreement.
The FFP was set up by Michel Platini after he was appointed UEFA director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that got into debt in the pursuit of new recruits were ultimately cheating and risked bankruptcy if the banks or owners refused to insure them.
In 2011, FFP's rules shifted its focus from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and spending huge sums on players and building a global brand - suddenly wasn't so profitable.
The Commission notes that the aid is not compatible with the internal market.
And although Platini was forced to leave office in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, is determined to advocate for a ban on excessive spending.
"The FFP rules are still in place and we are determined to strengthen them in the future", Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP compliance, told the Associated Press last week.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the compensation to be paid to the French authorities for the purchase of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44,4 million per year for five years.
The first wave of the FFP's maximum sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
The club was fined EUR 60 million ($82 million) - later reduced to EUR 20 million - and ordered to reduce its Champions League squad to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of 25.
UEFA is wary of teams that may try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies linked to club owners.
The Commission notes that the aid is limited to the minimum necessary to cover the costs of the marketing services provided by the airline.
The Commission notes that the measures in question were not implemented in the context of the restructuring plan.
Some reports suggest that part of Neymar's earnings at PSG could be paid by the organising committee of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
However, PSG and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar denied that Neymat would become the FIFA ambassador in football and that such a maneuver would be easily detected by UEFA officials.
Previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be watching closely for any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to a spokesperson on Tuesday, UEFA has not launched an investigation into Neymar's move to PSG.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous, as he is not authorized to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press reported.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsorships, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent upon signing the contract.
Spanish league officials, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, have sought to prevent Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG will break FFP rules.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' of the club and the state", La Liga president Javier Teba told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to PSG's ownership by a Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's position on the club's financing.
"It's the result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the world of football over the last 15 years", Wenger said Thursday.
Once the club is owned by the state, anything is possible.
The rules on financial fair play are very difficult to enforce, as the State may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club.
Changes are painful, but we must believe.
16,000 standing applauding fans.
Tomasz Rosický is going to the square.
Same scene as Sunday's game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan striker was playing against Red Star, he made some goals, but his teammates didn't go to black.
The summer team, infused with new multi-million dollar supporters, is out of the European Cup after the opening double.
Was it difficult to do anything else after the Belgrade goal?
After the goal was scored, it took four shots, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to at least not lose, to build up our confidence so we could have something to repel ourselves in the next few games.
We had a chance.
We need to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why didn't Sparta get into the match so soon?
The game is so elaborate.
The combinations of the opponent were much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere, we fired maybe one shot in the half.
That's not much, of course, when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponent into positions like that more often.
Is the problem the large number of changes in the lineup?
Of course, it's one of the pains of forming a new team.
We've only played three competitive matches and the lineup keeps changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect 11 to sit on.
Is it encouraging to you that you've already played parts of two matches in a row?
It's still part of the game.
I don't know how my condition is gonna play out, or when I'll be able to play again.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't.
It's the same as with an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has made a decision, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will get worse.
Fans came in large numbers again, but left embarrassed.
What can you tell them?
There was another wonderful visit, just like with Bohemka.
I'm so sorry we can't please them with a better performance.
Show them something they'll come back for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember visiting like that when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without trophies at least be an advantage for the league?
We're fighting ourselves, playing each other, so it's not that advantageous.
For extreme tax evasion, the businessman is facing ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Jiří Tomán, who is facing a 10-year prison sentence for tax evasion.
The damage is estimated at 645 million crowns.
Toman claimed in his complaint that the justice system had violated his fundamental rights, and that the findings of fact of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were incomplete.
However, the constitutional judges found the complaint to be unfounded, as the CTC found in the court's database.
The CBI is not another appeals court.
'It cannot, as a fourth instance, examine the errors of fact or law allegedly committed by the ordinary courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms,' the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict is valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
Toman was then in extradition detention in Argentina, where he was also held at the time of the US decision, according to the resolution.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which corresponds to the damage incurred, according to the verdict.
The Supreme Court has called the case an extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He was the chairman of the board of World Service from 2005 to 2008.
The loss of CZK 645 million occurred only in the period from January to July 2008, the total leakage exceeding one billion according to the expert.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to prosecute Toman for the full amount.
According to the prosecution, World Service did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties of at least ten million crowns, she paid taxes in mere hundreds of dollars.
World Servis and some of the companies with which it did business have a relationship with businessman Radomir Vybíral, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison for VAT fraud in the fuel business.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court.
"Summer of No Survival" and "Comrade Detective" are playing on a nostalgic note.
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the famous characters of the '80s; the dirty '90s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced MTV's comedy sketch "The State"); and of course, the modern day, specifically 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd ventured into bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embodiment of our modern Facebook age of lasting memories.
From a French perspective, it looks like someone's out of breath.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked surprisingly well - not just because of the absurd humor (for example, the story of the creation of the talking can of vegetables, narrated by H. Jon Benjamin).
The writers had deviated from the main humorous points - middle-aged actors playing teenage, horny children - so as not to make fun of past events.
The adult-playing sequel Ten Years Later is less emotional and satirical in places, including parodies of 1990s thrillers like Hand in the Crib.
At one point, the character finds an Apple Powerbook, a roller skater, and a bunch of other things from 1991 in a pile of junk.
Many of the main storylines are repeating.
The kindhearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't transcended his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) instigated by George H. W. Bush (very well cast Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the many side stories.
Especially fun is watching the ever-young, long-haired Ruddy, aka the character Matt Dillon from The Young Ones, whose once-respectable character Andy is now a thing of the past.
Franks could start moments of random madness, like the recurring series Seven Up, until he reaches what I assume will be the logical conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later, where in the final scene, the entire group goes to the premiere of Summer of Invincibility.
Meanwhile, Comrade Detective on Amazon is appealing to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of So Normal Americans, the movie Atomic Blonde: No Regret, and even the series GLOW, which pits the icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes.
A comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanak, directed by Rhyse Thomas, is intended to be a television drama about two Bucharest police officers in 1980s Romania, who fight for truth and atheism in the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulica, who were adapted into English by Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
Some jokes are laughable (like police watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series has been voiced by many well-known actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But Comrade Detective is too focused on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes the Reagan-masked killer - and that's how it looks.
Six long episodes is too distracting and comedic moments are not enough.
In a shorter track, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" might work, as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in whose lobby two fat people devour hamburgers stacked on a large pile.
The clear message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn anything into a meal and an orgy.
The thinking of the Romanian creators was not wrong: we do so with our own culture as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes didn't live to see the IAAF lift the ban.
The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has confirmed at the London Congress the extension of the international ban on Russian athletes from competing due to a state-sponsored doping program.
The voting on the World Championship field, which starts on Friday, has been as unequivocal as expected.
The extension of the ban was supported by 166 delegates, with only 21 voting against.
The main reason for the rejection is primarily the fact that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as stated by the head of the IAAF Special Investigation Team, Rune Andersen, before the congress.
His group recommended that the ban be kept.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and there are still coaches with a disgraced reputation working in the country.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is also not yet fully functional.
However, RUSADA can now conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Although progress has been made, there is still much work to be done", said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, causing Russian athletes to miss last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, among others.
Despite the upcoming ban, 19 Russians will participate who have previously proven that they have been tested for a longer period outside the Russian anti-doping system.
But they won't be able to start in the national colors at the championships and if they win, they won't get the Russian anthem.
The Bank of England will keep the interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged following weak economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has fuelled speculation about strong growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain "on the back foot" in the context of maintaining interest rates - despite the tightening of household budgets.
The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted six to two to keep the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote to raise the interest rate supported a subdued economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the Bank forecast growth of 1,7% in 2017 and 1,6% in 2018, and warned that the reduction in household budgets would continue.
The Bank also indicated that growth should occur over the next few years due to inflation caused by Brexit and also stated that the rent on mobility should increase more than expected on financial markets.
The committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package to boost the economy, which was put in place a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Fixed-term Financing Plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should come into effect from next February, although the Bank of England has indicated that it will now offer £15 billion less than the planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the Bank stated: MPC forecasts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household incomes and a burden on consumption.
On the subject of rates, the Bank stated that it would be necessary to tighten the monetary policy belt to calm inflation, at a much higher rate than the markets expected.
Markets currently forecast a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be 'permissible' and 'limited'.
The Bank lowered its growth forecast for this year and next year from the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
The projected growth in 2018 of 1,8 % remained unchanged.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after the estimates were released.
The pound fell by 0.5 percent to $1.31 and by 0.4 percent to $1.11.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after a disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth - GDP stalled at 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is likely to remain at 0,3% in the third quarter, although the Bank expects it to pick up slightly towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report is little consolation for households hit by rising inflation and a meager wage increase, with the bank saying the situation will worsen before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy "will not prevent" the decline in incomes in the coming years, but wages are expected to "increase significantly" towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow due to high demand for British goods due to the weak pound, which will compensate for the lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision comes a year after the rate was cut to 0.025% in August last year in response to the shocking EU referendum vote, which caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will take at least four years to fully integrate prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's decision on the latest rates, many had demanded an increase in rates, along with rising inflation, which was putting increasing pressure on households.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, despite the Bank's statements that it expected this to change and that inflation should rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the excess relative to the 2% target was  entirely due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only increase once lenders start competing for contracts with a good outlook for the end of the year.
The market is looking particularly good for those who are ending existing contracts and re-mortgages - there are no-fee options on offer, as well as low rates that they are gaining in popularity.
The NHS prescribes controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will be given access to 'transformative' HIV treatment from September, following the Supreme Court's decision on funding the NHS drug.
The National Health Service (NSH) announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10 000 patients over a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to fund the trial period after an appeal court upheld a Supreme Court decision last year stating that the NHS had the funds to pay for PrEP despite statements that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was hailed by NHS England's Chief Executive Simon Stevens as a 'significant intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a 'decisive moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients, with additional clinics to join in October and full implementation across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among at-risk patients.
PrEP before sex means that there is enough of a specific drug in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested included gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who were not successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who will sign consent to participate in the trial, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by the appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in the UK can also register with their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in the trial.
The programme will cost taxpayers £10 million and NHS England has signed a contract this week to distribute the drugs after winning an international public contract.
The pilot period is designed to collect clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and large-scale implementation.
Simon Stevens added: This important intervention should complement and fully exploit the ever-expanding and increasingly successful HIV prevention effort.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of efforts to halt one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, executive director of the National Aids Trust, said, "We are witnessing a watershed moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is given correctly and to patients at risk, it offers the potential to turn the English HIV epidemic around.
From September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a powerful new tool that is individually controlled and does not require the need to persuade a partner, leading to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We are pleased to accept this declaration.'
Ian Green, the executive director of the Terrence Higgins Trust said, "The number one priority must be to rapidly roll out testing across the country; we must make it available to every patient.
We now have an experimental PrEP drug and are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV".
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delay and delay by the government.
The evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start testing across the country as soon as possible to protect those exposed to HIV and together to stop the spread of HIV in society.'
Life on the high side: a basement and clever design turned this tiny apartment in Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, traded a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Court in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the Queen Anne Smart Terrace, it is a striking example of modern design that makes the most of the space available.
"I used to live with my ex-husband in a much larger house in the Knightsbridge area", Joanne said.
I was looking for something more reasonable.
I came across this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him immediately and nodded to him that very day.
Since then, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
A one-room apartment with a complicated layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a basement to take advantage of the high ceiling.
I wanted a high ceiling, big windows, and lots of light.
Those were my demands, she said.
To do this, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill-based design and engineering firm Duck & Shed and used a nearly four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but a place to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to allow two gaps to fit over each other - so the challenge for architects was to create a basement that could be walked upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated", he explained.
We had to arrange both rooms so we could walk upright.
The idea was not only to build a simple platform, but also to bend the steel structure so that it was at the right height above and below the ceiling.
This arrangement allowed Erfan to build two full-fledged rooms on top of each other - while adding to the drama.
In the middle, they look out over the beautiful living room with the old Retrouvius-style copper window frames.
The mirrored furniture in gold, the silver line and the retro chandelier of Serge Mouille create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramaticity, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides, making it look longer.
The mirror board in the kitchen looks like a window into the next room.
There are storage rooms with mirrors at the entrance doors for storing the utensils and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of being much larger, is that it can be separated from the kitchen when it is not in use.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
But what's unique about this solution is the folding doors.
"We had to solve the technical side", Erfan says of the reinforced arched doors.
The doors are fitted with counterweights to allow them to be untied very easily.
By cleverly using space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 50 square feet [16 sq m], a second room, and a better overall layout.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is residential space - or the valuation of your property", Erfan said.
A realtor basically calculates the price of a house based on the area of the house when he enters it.
In this case, the living area was increased while maintaining quality materials that give the space a luxurious appearance.
"Material is very important because you touch it and you create an emotional bond with home", Erfan added.
You don't like the electrical wiring in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they won't win your hearts.
As it turned out, quality design and living space enhancement can turn a simple apartment into a masterpiece.
And like Joanne, you may eventually decide to stay.
The United States is dissolving.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a travel ban on its citizens in Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated by banning its citizens from traveling to California.
Of course, this is not a complete ban, but U.S. citizens are free to travel in all 50 states.
The issue is that California has banned the spending of state money on its citizens' travel to eight other states, which are Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who's going to stop this madness?
California is strongly pro-LGBT, and any dissent from the LGBT lifestyle is considered discrimination.
But Tennessee passed a law of conscience that says that a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the treatment of LGBT patients is not obligated to provide it, but is obligated to provide those patients with another therapist who does not have a moral problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws that exempt religious charities that have given birth to children from mothers who have given them to adoptive parents from the obligation to give the children to same-sex couples.
Because of these conscientious objection laws, California has prohibited the funding of trips to eight states of the Union from its own funds.
In practice, this means that California professors cannot have their universities pay for trips to science symposia, such as in Texas, because they are co-funded by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, in Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They have to get either federal grants to travel, but it's absurd for the federal government to fund travel for citizens from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience and its legislature passed a bill that says it also dislikes California's policies of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but it still won't impose a travel embargo on California because of it.
He's considering them as retaliation for California's travel ban on Tennessee.
And the same will apply to any state of the union that would impose a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
He also called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now the commentary.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to make laws on conscientious objection and to decide what their money is and is not to be used for.
Second, what's wrong with a conscience?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pigs, why can't he offer just beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why do you have to punish him by forcing him to sell pork when there are plenty of butchers offering pork?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a hefty fine for refusing to bake a cake at a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake Halloween cakes or any alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their domestic policies in non-federal jurisdictions according to their own preferences, i.e. according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightfully sought tolerance for their lifestyles.
Today, many members of this community follow the "live and let live" rule that all reasonable people should follow, but some activists seek not tolerance for themselves and others, but extreme intolerance for others.
They say that no one should ever again express moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and that if they do, they should be criminalised.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know of any situation in American history where states have deliberately done this to each other over political issues, except for one.
Even during the civil rights struggle, when the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South was on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only time was in the 1950s, when slavery was the political cause and the North was about to go to war with the South.
Of course, none of that is happening now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the blue democratic states and the red republican states is deepening, and the United States is mentally and internally disconnected.
Unauthorized agitation.
The critic of Putin got a fat fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year's presidential election.
He was fined by the court for inciting people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has organized two large anti-government street protests in the past two months and announced his intention to run for the post of head of state in March next year.
The incumbent Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He was fined for inciting people to demonstrate through videos posted on the Internet portal YouTube.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them off the judge's salary later", joked a Kremlin critic on Twitter.
The Russian Election Commission recently concluded that Navalny cannot run in the presidential election because he was previously convicted of fraud.
However, Navalny, who is considered an anti-corruption fighter, considers the relevant sentence to be politically motivated.
The court also imposed fines of 300,000 rubles and 25,000 rubles on two members of the Naval Pre-election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure in the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to prevent Navalny from running.
In February, he was sentenced to five years' probation for robbing the Kirovles forestry plant.
In May, the verdict was upheld by the court of appeals.
The verdict is so final, it prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth over $ 500 million
Now, more than four decades after their Italian family established an empire, two brothers are competing for one of the most expensive Victorian properties in the world, worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis resides on the Toorak estate, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has pursued a dispute over joint property and business assets all the way to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business back in 2014, but a heated dispute is being fought over and over in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother, Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, the first of which was purchased by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this location, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company in a transaction for $85 million.
The money was used to buy other properties, and the De Lutis family's portfolio now includes offices, construction land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and suburban shopping centres.
Paul owns approximately one third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who Paul describes as "the great driving force and dominant figure" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two thirds of the assets.
Court records show that Colin owns $316 million in real estate, while Paul manages $176 million in real estate.
Paul's problem was the distribution of property and financial resources.
"Colin's proposal sounded in my eyes very much in his favor", Paul wrote in a 2015 affidavit before the court.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also competing for control of the existing business - which Paul, according to Colin, cut off.
Colin objects by saying that it's not true and accuses Paul of mismanaging some of the real estate.
In a previous affidavit, Colin stated that he believes in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important thing", he wrote.
The cost of the trial is rising, hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and messages from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are flooded with lawyers including Allan Myers, QC and lawyers from both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk and candy bars from the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With the money they had made from the pledge, they bought property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the family's first jeans business.
Colin said that when he started Westco in his senior year of college, Paul was still a little boy, maybe 10 years old.
Anna De Lutis stated that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped that the transfer of the property to the sons would go smoothly.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court", she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group of companies, and Colin said Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left.
As Paul, Luke and Mark stated, they were "not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation".
Colin has since held back, despite the fact that he is a former board member of the AFL club, as stated in his 2015 autobiography by Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
He only replied to Colin via text message, stating that given the fact that the dispute was pending in court, I had nothing to add.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take the matter to court", he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of his court statements, Colin stated that he was trying to accommodate his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very displeased if he saw our present situation, "he made himself heard, adding that he still hoped for a successful solution.
On Friday, all hope was lost.
"Our disputes will be resolved in court soon", wrote Colin.
The bowl in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower the children.
MHD drivers are taking water and summer clothes.
At the kindergarten Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children now attend, they only go out in the morning.
The barn is being renovated and the trees haven't been planted to provide much shade.
There's no pool, but the teachers are showering the kids in the nebula.
In the afternoon, children stay in classrooms with drawn blinds and drawn curtains.
They're trying to cool the air with an air purifier because they don't have air conditioning.
It's hard for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature inside and outside exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we should not even have open operation during this period", said the director of the kindergarten, Miloslava Makovičková.
There's a glass corridor in the nursery where she says the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We'll air out in the morning after 6:00, close the windows, and have the southern side of the curtains to protect us.
"But it doesn't help much", she added.
They have better conditions at the forest nursery school in Hostivici, where the children spend most of their time outside.
We have trees on the property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful nutshell, a table underneath it, and we do things there", described the school's headmistress, Barbora Kompan.
Teachers try to take the children to the woods where it's colder.
The kids get their hats wet and they have water games on the schedule.
"We have a hand-held pressure sprayer that is used for spraying flowers, and we use it for showering children", said Kompan.
Also, the director of the kindergarten in Novoborská Street on Prague's Prosek Jitka Vilimovská said that the teachers try to keep the children in the shade and drip them with water.
"We have a fairly large garden, so they're under the trees", she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3:00.
Every child must have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They may choose, for example, a slightly sweetened tea or a diluted juice, and they may have water-based drinks in the garden.
They also have a vegetable salad for every day, and they always have fresh fruits and vegetables for breakfast, which their parents sometimes bring.
"Maybe today a mother brought a ten-kilogram melon for the children", Makovichkov added.
Drivers get water or summer uniform.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionized beverages or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabins of the drivers of trams and buses are in most cases air-conditioned, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
The high-temperature tram tracks have not caused any serious damage.
There was some minor damage to the loop in Hostivar.
In the current high temperatures, we are particularly concerned about providing drivers with sufficient beverages.
"Cold drinking water is available in all loops, switching points and carriages", said Röhková.
In the carriageways and at some changing places, there are so-called soda bars which produce chilled soda.
Drivers are also given soluble ionic protection drinks.
"They can also use summer uniforms, which increase the comfort of drivers on their daily shifts", the spokeswoman added.
The hot, dry weather of the last few days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters across the Czech Republic killed 108, double the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, when temperatures in the Czech Republic soared to over 35 degrees Celsius, the firefighters were primarily engaged in fighting the fires.
"Fires in the natural environment and those associated with harvest work are predominant", said fire service spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral.
The firefighters were not relieved by the evening change in weather, with storms and torrential rains alternating in the heat of the day.
Firefighters have been on the run for 236 hours in the storm.
This was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"The most intervened in the Central Bohemian region", Zaoral continues.
But the firefighters were also needed in Stvolínky, Czechoslovakia, where 60 people were evacuated to safety from a children's camp because of the storm.
The tropical temperatures also put the Prague rescue workers to work.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, ambulances were dispatched to a dozen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from the chamomile.
People should have their water heaters checked, emergency services warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is released during incomplete combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache, and fainting.
In case of suspected poisoning, the infected room should be evacuated.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb the president's media diet
Many have tried before him, and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Politico reported that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information about President Trump - including news reports - in the hope of keeping Trump informed.
Here is a bit of reporter Josh Dawsey 's report:
When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with staff on his first day in office, he outlined a key problem the Trump White House is working to fix: misinformation getting into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the staff that he had to personally approve all information - whether on paper or spoken word - because the president can make a better decision based on the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but many of his predecessors were upset by Trump's control and his presentation to the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching the news is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate was upset by honest reporting, it was appropriate to show him that there was a lot of other media talking about him in a positive light that was easier to convince", Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that the key to keeping Trump's tweets under control - at least according to six former campaign organizers - is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media praising him.
- I'll take it from here.
However, the idea that Trump's tendency to publish his views on Twitter was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something that others don't - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if they weren't monitored.
Tweets that Trump never sent, we'll probably never know about.
If his employees managed to keep him on the leash at least a few times, then their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever been able to stop Trump from routinely stirring up controversial topics.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of rival factions, people regularly try to bolster their agenda by feeding Trump materials - which may or may not be reliable - that support their worldview.
Politico, which has covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the tendency of advisers to present dubious information to the head of state.
Here's an example of such information from the pen of reporter Shane Goldmacher:
Trump's current and former officials say that the president often reacts very angrily to negative media reports, especially reports of leaks, and tries to find their source.
This situation occurred in late February when someone passed the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com - the website of the provocateur Charles C. Johnson - which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the "source of many leaks" from the White House.
Regardless of whether Johnson was banned from Twitter for life for harassment; or that he didn't back up his claims with any evidence; or that he had already published false accusations in the past and later retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter were trying to implement a system to manage and document the information that President Trump would receive.
Would it work?
Now, three months later, Kelly is trying to implement the same strategy.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsivity won't go away and his aides are still competing for power.
These constant factors will certainly make Kelly's mission more difficult.
Tourists negotiate excavation and return to the "Millionaire's Quarter"
Several of the wealthiest homeowners in the English county of West Midlands are once again engaging in a feud with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities for the rights to regain the land for their homes.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field on a flourishing street in Solihull, nicknamed the "Millionaire's Quarter".
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, the tourists return after being expelled in May, unafraid of the trench that was dug at the site by order of the authorities to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found gaps in the defenses and penetrated the field with caravans unprotected by the gap that served as a path.
Angry neighbourhood residents have attacked Solihull City Council for 'not being able to solve the problem'.
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "They occupied the site on Monday evening after they were moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists have been moved to another location and now they're back.
Last night more arrived, and today there will probably be more.'
She added: "The Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with this problem, and it's using court orders to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't intend to pay any more taxes until the board of directors has dealt with the tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said, "It's ridiculous, we've just been watching the last tourists leave and now they're back.
And this time there are more, and this time they brought horses.'
A spokesman for the Solihull City Council said: "We are aware of the unauthorised occupation of the property near Streetsbrook Road and are working with the local police to take the necessary legal action to resolve the issue".
To gather as much evidence as possible, it is imperative that as many local residents as possible report any unsocial or illegal behavior to the police on 101.
We'll get the big picture for the court".
A Member's husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
Government special forces transported the wounded Robert Zhitnyanskyi to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport, and he was under constant supervision by Slovak doctors on board the plane.
The long-planned flight went off without any complications.
According to TV JOJ, Robert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After being repatriated, he was transported to a specialized workplace in one of the hospitals in Bratislava.
The economic analyst is married to Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská from NOVA.
She wouldn't comment on the incident.
The couple has three children together.
Italians claim to fight NGO rescue boats with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue boats arriving on Italian shores with migrants from the Mediterranean unless the NGO signs new rules governing their operations.
"Unless NGOs sign the new code of conduct, it will be hard for us to imagine that they can continue their operations", Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin's daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized the ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which is in its first year of operation, declined to comment on the case because of accusations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosios.
"Saving lives is and always will be our number one priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the rescue zones at this time", the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only comment on any current allegations after gathering all the information and evaluating the whole situation".
The Italian authorities have been tracking the ship Iuventa, belonging to the Jugend Rettet organisation, since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on board, who were handed over to them directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place, according to the prosecutor's file, only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, the Italian media reported.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian coast guard, which oversees the rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, more than anything else.
The code of conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board a ship such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in the rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, the Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable as they did not represent any 'substantial change or obstacle' to rescue operations.
The Nobel Prize winner Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has also refused to adopt the new code of conduct.
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the sharp decline in immigrants landing in Italy in recent weeks as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen coastguards and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In the last few days we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel", the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further talks this month with the mayor of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
She's got silicone and cellulite from the overalls!
Hot summer days are tempting to wear only the essentials, which will cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominica Mesarosa does it the other way around.
At an afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where actors, hosts, singers and everyone involved with TV Prima were just crowding, she covered her little body in a mini overal.
And it was just a few simple moves and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her butt.
She checked how many times it was cut in half, and it was so high that she had to adjust it all the time.
She certainly didn't need the attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages inciting the suicide of Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months of a two-year sentence behind bars followed by five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father testified in court Thursday, "The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.
Carter was kept at large until the verdict.
She faced up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and cream blouses, Carter stood at the scene of the verdict with tears in her eyes, her hands folded and her eyes down to the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy", the prosecutor told the judge.
She ended his life to relieve herself.
She was unable to accept her own responsibility, she said.
She didn't have any regrets.
Carter's attorney, however, said that it was an unfortunate circumstance, which he deeply regretted.
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder had no significant impact on her proceedings.
The plaintiff read Roy's mother Lynn Roy's statement: "Not a day goes by that I don't mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me for taking care of his sisters and for us to endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever", the statement read.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was haunted by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be an aunt to his children.
"The loss of the person I've been seeing since I was born is the pain I'll carry with me for the rest of my life", she said.
The state of Massachusetts has no law in place that would punish a person for assisting another person's suicide, so this case sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in the back seat of a car in 2014, carbon monoxide poisoning.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's suicide-promoting text messages were published.
"Either hang yourself, jump off a building or stab yourself, I don't care", was the text message Carter sent just two weeks before his death, when Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before she killed herself, she wrote to him, "You must do it, Conrad, and you must turn on the generator, and you will be free and happy".
Judge Moniz said Carter was seeking attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comment in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and acquitted of the charges two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison".
Audi will modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to the sharp response
Just a day before the announcement of Audi, carmaker BMW said it would offer its customers software updates on more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes that 'there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions' in response to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will be retrofitting three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies referred to this decision as a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have been promoting the use of diesel cars to a large extent in Europe and the United States to comply with the CO2 emissions regulations.
However, the nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the costs of installing equipment to neutralize the gases emitted by diesel engines are increasing for the car manufacturers, which makes it difficult for cars to compete.
While German carmakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, in an effort to meet the emission limits, installed software in its cars that reduced the amount of emissions emitted during testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo's former manager Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and therefore not subject to extradition, so he may face a trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi joined the German police's criminal investigation into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system designed to circumvent European emission limits - expanding the charges Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may have a negative impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane has made an emergency landing on the beach.
The man and the girl died.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São João in the Costa da Caparica, about 20 miles [30 km] south of Lisbon.
An eyewitness told SIC Noticias that the plane flew just above people who were sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach were reportedly fleeing danger into the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl were killed on the beach, according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead on the spot", described local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not known yet.
There were two people on board the plane, both of whom survived the crash and were taken away for questioning by the police.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are the motorways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's undeveloped, although it was built in 1978.
Even though it's unfinished, it's constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built anymore, even if it has a building permit.
What is it? What is it?
Yes, the D11 freeway.
Construction of the next section of the tunnel has been halted for at least a few months by the Children of the Earth movement.
We Easterners get the highway in pieces, like when you cut a salad.
They'll cut the wheel and then we'll see if and when we get another one.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the travel time and get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Endless flows of trucks pass right through the town of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not possible to bypass.
But so far, the last stretch of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, which is an incredible nine years ago.
Not a word since.
So when the construction of the remaining four kilometers of the unfinished section to Hradec Králová and the archaeological survey of the other sections to Jaroměra began recently, with construction scheduled to begin at the end of this year, you could hear the loud beating of the horns in eastern Bohemia.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week it turned out that there's no construction this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children's Land Club for Sustainable Transportation from Brno has filed for dissolution.
The Earth children are repeating their D1 tactics.
They challenged the building permit decision in its entirety.
In the schedule, they request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the municipal government, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Highway Administration.
So we're off the D11 near a village with the eloquent name of Pohobyčka.
So we get off, we just drive down the highway, and then we're standing on a side road, and we're going to prefer to line up next.
The worst part is you see stories like this all over the Republic.
A scary, constantly congested road to Benešov, the D1 or D8 motorways.
Everyone has their own little sparkle.
What do the Children of Earth demand?
What is the nature of the problems of the construction of communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the existing highway system virtually unfinished?

Lavender from Provence is threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in southeastern France, but it is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to a dry climate and harmful insects, which has caused panic in the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "The cultivation of lavender in Provence is threatened because in recent years the plant has been exposed to climate changes that result in less rainfall in spring and autumn.
It affects the life of lavender.
The other culprits are cicadas and grasshoppers, which carry micro-bacteria that thrive in dry climates.
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender is a tourist attraction, and the oil it produces is an important ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of tall and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavender plants is, of course, smaller.
A possible solution could be to distribute water more efficiently and slow down the evaporation of water from the soil, but also to spray lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and to breed more species that are resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threats in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoca meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the unrest in the Sinaloa area involving organized crime, corrupt officials, and the unending drug wars.
Today, however, under the pressure of recent events, it is primarily for its own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two veteran journalists discuss what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that was bombed in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: adversaries, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to put names to every word - no proof needed, just use imagination and hunch.
Choose from what - drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists - are suspected of receiving money from the government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose job it is to cover up criminal activity.
Violence continues and bodies pile up across the country; journalists are increasingly among them: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there have been at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them is the co-founder of the periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist", Valdez wrote in one of his many books about violence linked to the drug trade.
His loss is palpable, though his presence is pervasive - a large photograph of Valdez with the word "Justice" pointed at by a middle finger hangs in the front of the building; two journalists, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, in their 30s, wear a T-shirt with a picture of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and a Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; reporters talk about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, the Committee to Protect Journalists has so far prosecuted two suspects.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, so it's very rare that journalists' killers get prosecuted.
Riodoka reporters insist on reporting on the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are devastated by grief and the area is currently very treacherous.
Without information on the killers and without a sense of justice, the security meeting is pointless, says Ibarra.
"It's foolish to waste time on such meetings", he adds.
"Unless we get more information, no one can be trusted".
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodoca in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to get away a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and shot him to death with 12 bullets, apparently because of the title of the article - which translates as the Twelfth River.
The gunmen then boarded his car and drove it into the road not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
It seems that rumors spread quickly in Culiacán.
But in Valdez's case, there is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzmán's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions seek to fill a vacant seat.
Every day, several people are killed on the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is filled with elaborate two-story mausoleums for drug lords, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "armistice" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with its precious ports and important routes for drugs to travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately familiar with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, co-founder and CEO of Riodoca, still blames himself for not protecting his friend.
She believes she contributed to his death by two misdeeds.
The first was a February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war on the sons of Joaquín Guzmán.
The peace might have angered the sons; suspicious gang members bought all the copies of the newspaper as soon as they landed on the counter.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after other newspapers were seized that printed the same story.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as a major milestone in the fight between Mexican criminals and journalists.
He'd managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that would never change.
He was practically a veteran of the Noroeste newspaper when in 2003 he decided to sell his $50 worth of stock and found Riodoce with five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, it was "impossible to run a newspaper without mentioning the drug trade", Bojorquez said.
In time, Riodoke gained a reputation for courageous and truthful reporting; the newspapers began to prosper.
Journalists were keen to explore problematic topics and publish uncensored texts - readers were fascinated by stories that no one else dared publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courageous reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted he was afraid.
"I was afraid for my life", he said when he accepted the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a "way of life", Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
You have to play the journalist or play the fool.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you do in the face of death... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The staff at Riodoca misses Valdez, a man known for his wit and his unpredictable language, a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs, a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He would often go to the El Guayabo bar across the street from the office and sit at the same table.
Now they ask, did this routine cause his death?
His death also raised questions about their own assumptions - how to do their job best and stay alive?
They don't like you getting involved with their wives, children, clean shops, secret airfields.
"These things were forbidden", Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something's wrong, hands off.
The problem is, Riodoca editor Andres Villarreal said, "The eye is a sense that can be tricked"... and then there was the Javier thing.
He says the old rules, like others, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as do the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and others, which are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones are allowed in the Riodoca staff room, as a spyware was discovered a few days ago that the government was buying to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Outside the building, two police officers find relief from the 40-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the offices of Riodoca, which are located in a four-story building in the Culiacan city district.
The press jokes that these police officers are not among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials who the government claims are corrupt.
It's been months since journalists have been in the mountainous areas, which are basically controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the program this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloa.
They're also investigating suspicious government spending in the governor's hometown.
There were also several recent kidnappings at one of Culiacán's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the state's attorney's office.
Officially, no one had revealed the identity of the abductees or the circumstances of the abduction, so the reporters were careful about reporting what every townspeople knew: that the restaurant was a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name that is associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of the political scene for almost the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to report on previous incidents that occurred at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán's sons escaped an army task force.
A month ago, readers would have read about this in the Valdez column, which was the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly solve the case", said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
Now all the informants have turned their backs on us.
Valdez's office had become a storage facility for signs and stickers to protest against the killing of journalists, and the employees certainly didn't expect them to become activists representing the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went out the next morning to protest outside the state's attorney's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after the Valdez murder in western Michoacán.
The only body found was a burnt body, which authorities say is Adam's, based on DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is intensifying across the country, many of them organizing protests and splashing on the sidewalks and buildings.
Editor Bojorquez is on a visit to Washington, D.C. today, where he's trying to gain international support and get justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, held the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for reporting the truth.
Meanwhile, she requested transfer to another ward, fearing that her anger might jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "inundated" by organized crime, corrupt officials and public apathy.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists are dying not only at the hands of drug cartels but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who collaborate with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 blamed more than half of all attacks on journalists on police and public officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to silence you", Ramirez added.
Murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, which occurred six years ago near the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up because of my reports".
There was a keyboard and a headset next to the severed head.
Some of its branches have decided to shut down, such as El Norte, based on the northern border of Chihuahua state, in response to the murder of its reporter Miroslava Breach in March.
Others are still continuing, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front-page article entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their homes or even crossed the border.
It's a tough call.
Finding work in exile is difficult, as is getting rid of the feeling that you are constantly being stalked.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four other women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their jobs, every day is a big risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, that's why I became a journalist", he said.
It's midnight on Friday, and Riodoca employees are sitting on the sidewalk in front of their office - the latest issue sent to the printer - sipping beer when the phone starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and police near the beach resort town of Mazatlan.
The war is escalating, just as promised by many messages left in this area by members of the syndicate.
The news is being published on the Riodoca website via mobile phone.
Not a day goes by and the opening title changes again.
The sounds of police sirens indicate another shooting.
Bojorquez takes a peek at the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're afraid, they don't show it.
Beneath the huge portrait of their fallen magazine co-founder - whose middle finger is the eloquent slogan for all of Sinaloa - all Riodoc employees follow in his footsteps.
"How could we even think of leaving", said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her out on the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, as scary as it is.
Researchers have now revealed the conclusions of the first findings of a remarkable creature the size of a rhinoceros, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts have dubbed the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs" - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were so well preserved that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of its scaly skin and stated that the dinosaur had a 'problematic past.'
An article in Current Biology called it "the most well-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world".
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae, dinosaurs that lived during the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers, who described it as 'truly remarkable.'
The armored whitetail is the best-preserved fossil of its kind, according to National Geographic.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across what looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover the animal from a huge patch of land weighing 1,100 kilograms.
Once the work is done, the dinosaur is ready to be unveiled.
"Just blink a little and you'll believe it's asleep", said Caleb Brown, the project manager and naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
"It will surely go down in history as one of the most beautiful and most cherished dinosaur species - the Mona Lisa dinosaur".
By studying its skin, researchers found that this herbivore - though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank - was likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a camouflage system that many animals use today.
Experts say this allowed it to blend in better with its surroundings and avoid enemies, and the masking system suggests that it was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of a 110 million-year-old dinosaur of the family Nodosauridae first appeared in the press in May and is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who and his team spent more than 7,000 hours carefully unearthing the fossil.
Thanks to the amazing preservation of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shape of the scales and armor throughout the body.
They discovered a method of camouflage commonly used by modern animals for defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than the lower part.
Although this cloaking effect is common in nature, the researchers' findings are surprising because the size of the Borealopelta far exceeds that of animals using the same technique today.
So it's possible that dinosaurs were so many predators that evolution preferred camouflage to confrontation in order to survive.
Many of the modern masked animals - such as the deer, zebra, and orange - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that Nosodora must have literally fought for its survivors.
"The sale of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur vividly illustrates the dangers posed by predators in the Cretaceous period", said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the shells also revealed that the dinosaur skin was likely reddish-brown.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for further information about its life, including the preserved contents of its stomach, to trace its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was carried to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
Alberta had the same climate as Florida today, and the rivers and oceans were much farther inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved exoskeleton, and at the same time it is preserved in three dimensions so that we can see its original size", said Brown.
For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as it did in the Cretaceous.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just blink a little and it seems as if it were just sleeping.'
In the Cretaceous, there were giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that moved on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been a favorite prey of its equally fearsome ancestors.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5 meter long monster that weighs over six tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that the body of Borealopel was washed out to sea after being mummified in mud.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling in a Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is also complete from the chin to the hip.
The animal was on average 5 meters long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two 50-centimeter spines protruding from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed what is now Canada until it ended up in a river that washed it out to sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, finding an individual preserved in this way is like winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the more shocking the find seems.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right foreleg with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his feet.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her whole body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a fellow St. Louis resident sat on a bed in an Airbnb room and was browsing Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a contribution from a high school student.
"Police have just shot an 18-year-old whose body is still lying in the street".
She was surprised that no one else had written this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
@TheePharoah kept retweeting her posts on the wall.
A St. Louis rapper posted on Twitter about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying helpless on the street, where no one had picked him up for four hours.
"This is crazy", thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She hung up the phone to go back to him the night she was watching tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
She was watching photos of police tapes and screaming people, one of the men claiming to be the father of the victim, holding a sign that said, "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son!"
She was watching live - one of the police officers was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a lead and a barking dog on the other end.
In another video, another policeman, she said, held a gun in his hand, pointed it at the crowd and shouted: "I'll kill you all... animals".
"This is not normal", said Ferrell.
This is not the kind of murder we're used to, which we might call normal.
I felt goose skin all over my body.
I was angry and I cried.
She immediately booked a return flight and left for home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to head to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is told in the new documentary Whose Streets? which will be released in theaters on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and hate, strength and resilience told from the perspective of people in the community who take to the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell began a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a flowery shirt and the same flower headband - on a topic they had discussed many times before - the black experience.
Remember when I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old, and that's not right.
"It seemed impossible not to take her with me", Ferrell later said.
Today's events are the culmination of events that happened in the past.
She must have known and seen it with her own eyes and grown up with it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but also to recognize the difference between the different layers of black experience and what we need to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions where she does not experience racism on her own, she is in no way different from other black child-women.
I feel like if I protect her from this experience, I'm only hurting her.
On arrival in Ferguson, the first stop was South Florissant Road across from the police station, which became a base for activists awaiting word from Officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who prepared food for the others.
Together they packed food and helped to distribute it to Protestants.
A new kind of activism was slowly emerging in Ferrell's eyes.
"My activism was turned upside down after August 9", Ferrell said, adding that while attending the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and worked to bring health care and food to black communities.
I had no experience with organization.
It was natural.
A few weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met the later co-director of the documentary, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were merely trying to document the events that were taking place.
But Ferrell thought, "Are you working on a documentary or are you trying to find a story that could be used?"
This type of skepticism was infiltrated into the community by many people, often white people, who wanted to profit from pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an unannounced interview: "We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often ignored, and we wanted to change that".
Folayan has already teamed up with co-director Damon Davis, who is a well-respected local artist who deals with the subject of death row inmates.
His involvement in the project also intrigued Ferrell and six other local residents who were followed by the Whose Streets team in the years following Brown's murder.
"No one in this document speaks for us, but it is our testimony", Davis said.
"It was important to me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way".
While the documentary was not meant to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to show that the movement is not about a rescue leader, but about bringing the community together, Folayan said - it turned out that she was the most open to being involved in the filming.
The documentary "Whose Streets?" describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, such as how he fell in love with his wife.
"I felt like I was naked", Ferrell said with a smile on her face as she thought about the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
But I realized that in order to do this job and to please black people, I had to open up.
Ferrell's story also highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created a #BlackLivesMatter social media campaign in response to the 2012 murder of teenager Trayvon Martin - call themselves freaks.
"Extreme black women in leadership positions ultimately are behind the preservation of the movement", said Ferrell, "because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women have to bear the brunt of these events.
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of eccentric black women.
She insists, however, that this is not merely an affirmative matter and that Ferrell is not the main character of the document because of her views.
"It was the driving force and the source of energy", she said.
That she was on the front lines is no accident, because life on these crossroads in the skin of a black savage woman is dangerous.
You can feel the surge of energy in front of the screen.
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, television cameras have cleared their positions, but heavy racial tensions remain between the community and the police.
Ferrell is serving two and a half years probation for blocking the highway during a protest.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home as "disorder".
Yet she persists in her quest, which she has been committed to since she set out on the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains.
A field was burning in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters arrived, including a helicopter.
Near the Czech Brod on Kolinsk, between the villages of Bylany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares burned since 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading at about 3:15 p.m., and the fire department declared a third-level fire alarm out of four possible.
According to firefighters' spokesman Ladislav Holomchik, a helicopter helped extinguish the fire from the air.
At 18:00 the firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, causing damage of 700,000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters were on the scene to fight the flames.
The fire was caused by a technical malfunction in the engine room of the combine.
A helicopter was also used to help Hasit, which carried out six water strikes in all.
"We have handed over the site to the owner, until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. it will be guarded by a volunteer fire brigade", Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are several faces of different shades of skin - white, black, and brown - hanging from the ceiling on wires, each of them as if out of the previous one's eye.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from oral extracts and hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for illegally leaking classified cables to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transsexual and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Obama three days before he left office.
By algorithmically analyzing Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to represent what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, if not intellectual commentary on the submissiveness of DNA - as well as the many ways DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken out about her self-identification as a woman since she was a young girl, and was convicted in 2013 on 20 counts, including six counts of violating the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were withheld by prison staff, with only one black-and-white photograph leaked to the public in inferior quality, showing Manning, visibly distressed, sitting in the driver's seat in a platinum-blonde wig, to which she is now attached.
In 2015, there was still a positive response to the Dewey-Hagborg project Stranger Visions from 2012.
In this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create a picture of possible similarities between these people.
And just about this time, she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add a portrait to the article", Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opening of the new exhibition.
But no visitors or photographs were allowed, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends over the course of two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
In fact, President Obama asked for Manning's release a few days after the comic book was published, which was a welcome change after several excruciating years in a military prison in Kansas.
It's interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging a war against people who seek to leak government information and transgender soldiers, while he's trying to find new ways to incite anger with his tweets in areas he should be supporting.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that 'everything happens for a reason'.
Under a statement by the artist on one of the gallery walls, Manning calls out with her huge signature (the letter i in her last name is printed with a heart) for an end to the self-serving factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - a hundredth of the letters C, G and A written in pencil.
By arranging the 200 letters (or nucleotides, in the artist's sophisticated scientific dictionary) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
"I hope people will take away from this that our genome doesn't matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way", said Dewey-Hagborg.
DNA tells many different stories, here's 30 of them.
The last exhibit, in a separate room, is a single page from the graphic novel mentioned above.
It shows Manning emerging in a King Kong fashion from the United States Disciplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
"Once they stop you from speaking, they win", it says.
Never let yourself be silenced.
"It's a direct transcript of one of the letters", said the Philadelphia artist.
When I think about it, my skin just jumps.
Manning has not yet visited the exhibition in person -- as predicted in the comic book -- but when she does, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genomic images, lined up like a protest crowd.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including a nearly six foot tall statue of Manning, which is a pencil-shaped record of her genetic haplogroups.
"They've been on the walls in the past, but this time I wanted them to have a sense of the crowd", Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
I wanted to create the impression of a mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and liberates her.
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff, who are being prosecuted on suspicion of the murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a Chicago luxury apartment, police said.
Warrants for first-degree murder were issued Monday for the men, Wyndham Lath, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleaux, according to Cook County court records.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died from multiple stab wounds.
Chicago police say the body was found July 27.
Police were alerted by telephone, and upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with multiple lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide, while police are searching for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public affairs, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from the university campus.
"The matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them", Cubbage said.
Warren is the chief financial officer at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been contacted by the British police and are ready to assist the American police as well".
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the whole thing and wish he would turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, the Chicago Police Department's public relations director, said he's urging the suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
"Police have information on their whereabouts and efforts to track down suspects are intensifying", he told Guglielmi.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are helping police in their search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to an event that was supposed to take place at apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were caught on security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim", he told the Guglielli.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: "Police are now working on compiling a timeline and profile of the victim and investigating various motives, including domestic violence".
In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) were implemented and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) re-established.
 At present, part of the criteria for the new plan have been completed and RUSADA has already obtained planning and testing rights in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In light of this, the WADA plan has been updated, Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-Chairman commented on the second part of WADA's plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutk, the code contains nothing that should concern Russia.
Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be made available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, he added.
One of the criteria mentioned, however, calls for the public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation by Richard McLaren into the government's alleged sponsorship of Russian athletes for doping.
On this subject, Mutko said: "We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All arrangements have been made.
But there were no government programmes in our country, so we cannot admit to something that never existed.
Mutk's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, the director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with RSport Russia, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: "We have stated on many occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
"No one plans to accept the report completely without reservation", Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected Russia of issuing doping controls within Russia in November 2015, immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation authorised the planning and consolidation of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to WADA's Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was "on the right track" to renew its validity.
Police have charged three people, one of them a minor.
Police have charged three men with setting fire to a rare wooden church in Trinity Gutch on Friday.
One of the accused is a minor, all three are of Czech nationality.
They face up to 15 years in prison for a felony of public danger.
Moravian-Silesian police chief Tomáš Kužel told reporters today.
He said it was a premeditated crime.
"It's a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter", Kužel said.
He stated that the police would discuss the possible arrest of the accused.
According to the Director, no further information can be disclosed.
"I can't say more because the criminal police and the investigation and the prosecutor who is overseeing the case are actually working on the case", Kužel said.
The wooden Church of the Body of God in Gutech dates from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original furnishings and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The damage is estimated to be in the tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the church was being rebuilt.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, the Ministry of Culture and the city are prepared to share the additional costs, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, the local parish, is expected.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine in Ostrava-Hrabova from the 16th century was also destroyed by fire 15 years ago.
It was caused by a malfunction in the electrical system.
In its place, an exact replica was made.
The state relies on its citizens to defend the state.
It will support their training.
The objective of the Law on the readiness of citizens to defend the State is to provide financial support for associations for the defence of the State, for voluntary shooting training or for a team of trainers.
The Ministry of Defence, which was commissioned by the government to produce the report, promised that it would improve the physical fitness of the Czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
It's a result of a proposal the department prepared.
If the law were to be passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support defense.
The basic objective of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the inhabitants of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the performance of defence duty and on a voluntary basis.
For example, the State would support, financially or materially, amateur radio, marksmen's or kinologists' associations and would enable them to improve the skills of their members.
In return, it would receive information on the people willing to come to the country in times of crisis to help if needed, and their skills or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and other interested parties in training or education.
It also includes the organization of talks with war veterans or people who have acted heroically.
One possible option is to create a new office to administer and coordinate the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that people's participation should be voluntary and the state would use their skills only after a state of emergency is declared.
'The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious boundaries between different types of threats,' the intention states, referring to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting as many capabilities as possible, not just military ones.
'The basic objective of the plan is to create a very broad base that will enable every citizen to respond in a qualified manner to situations threatening the sovereignty of the State or the life, health and property of persons, to protect himself or herself, or to contribute to the protection of others, and not to make the armed forces of the Czech Republic more difficult to perform their tasks by misconduct,' the plan states.
The bill would be financially difficult to pass.
The amount will depend on the variant chosen, according to the Ministry.
For example, the Office envisages financial support for projects to train citizens for state defense of up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
The rest of the money would go to payroll or build an information system.
The proposal also provides that the regional military commands would have to be extended to employ a total of 42 additional soldiers.
Ministry officials have previously said that the law should also help resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of the European Union directive on gun ownership.
Its adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to keep certain weapons which the directive prohibits.
Startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but she couldn't find the right survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And even though she promised anonymity for the survey, some employees expressed distrust of the entire process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity", said Errett, owner of the San Francisco-based e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from outside.
New HR startups are constantly appearing on the market, helping companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific intention of measuring employee obligations, startups enable companies to conduct quick voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer total employee anonymity and a complaint hotline, and in some cases even allow whistleblowers to bypass superiors and contact direct managers.
"There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said that thanks to Glitter, she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling over the past three years.
In addition to quick surveys and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company heat map and a snapshot of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as a snapshot of the managers with the lowest ratings - allowing users to work on correction.
Companies are starting to realize that they need to look out for the workplace culture - in case they become another Uber - which is mired in scandals after a former employee posted a blog post describing the company environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak out.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the website Let's Talk Payments, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance industry could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small surge in interest and activity earlier this year, just before the Uber scandals.
Nearly 600 of Convercent's clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He recently took Uber under his wing.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send out customizable flash surveys, collect confidential information in real time and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved, complaints shall be sent directly to the Management Board.
"The court of public opinion has its regulators", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of startup Convercent.
If a company is convicted of mistreating its employees or unethical behaviour - and if regulators do not intervene - it may face costly consequences from customer boycotts, employee exhaustion or lawsuits, Quinlan added.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain that employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employee awareness of company policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate management.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to find a phone number or an e-mail address for the company management, file a formal complaint, and hope for a successful resolution.
It was often a daunting and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, who said there had been no reliable way to track employee complaints.
Now, with Convercent, the company ensures that problems that never before reached managers sitting in their offices, miles away from the actual resolution of complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment - are detected and resolved quickly.
"It's moving towards a holistic, holistic view of the employee experience", said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
We also protect shareholders from employee litigation.
Companies stopped taking ethics, values and employee participation lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron's fall over employee ethics abuses, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until social media shed light on the whole thing that companies started to realize that in the online world they can't just hide their skeletons in the closet.
"Before people started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith", Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service for which the companies pay regular fees.
It's a business model and an opportunity that's been embraced by the bold venture capitalists who have backed both startups.
Convercent raised a total of $10 million in its February campaign from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and ultimately took out $47 million in capital.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, and raised $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of the companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing number of studies clearly confirm that employees today expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and exciting projects aren't the main advantage.
Employees want to feel accepted and appreciated and that they are giving their time to a company that is striving for a positive mission.
"If people are happy at their jobs, feel that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they are striving for the success of the company", said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money when companies are successful, and companies prosper when their employees are happy.
And when an analytics tool comes to market that ensures employee engagement and commitment to the company, it's no wonder there are a lot of investors who will support this effort.
According to work culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless unless society takes the necessary action.
The fact is that once a company asks for feedback from its employees, big changes can happen.
And if change is not made quickly - at worst - it can cause frustration and disinterest among employees.
"Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations", said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who has seen many companies rely too heavily on data alone.
Because once you don't get things done, the employees start asking themselves, "Did they hear me?
They're interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?'"
Madison Reed, which now conducts a regular monthly employee survey, can solve the problem within a day with Glinth, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by the slow decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important insight into its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the long term in an industry known for frequent layoffs.
"If you don't work to create a transparent work environment, employees won't trust you", added Vitrano.
And once you start losing employees, you're going to lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt.
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic, with a record high of 38.3 degrees Fahrenheit recorded at the Watchtower in Hodonín.
He beat Tuesday, which was originally the hottest day of the year at 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
But not many temperatures have hit record highs since Tuesday.
The weather was mostly in Moravia, and the Czech Republic was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or matched at 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
For example, today's temperature in Watchtower was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In the Breslau region, the current temperature of 37.4 degrees has exceeded the previous maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in the Brno region, the current temperature of 37.1 degrees has exceeded the previous record by three tenths.
Both records, like The Watchtower's, were from 2013.
High temperatures were observed today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Guard, the hottest was in Dyjakovice in Znojemsk and Brodë nad Dyja in Breslau, where the mercury rose to 37.8 degrees, but did not exceed the record.
In contrast, according to the Czech Health Ministry's website, the highest temperatures so far in western and northwestern Czechia have been only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there have only started to rise this late afternoon", the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and more heavy rain could come on Sunday.
In most parts of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in southeastern Moravia on Saturday.
We've got a mess here.
Billionaires don't get the same vote in an election as every single adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as bold as Andrej Babis, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of the Penty, Marek Dospiva, together with other colleagues behind the water, Martin Burda and Antonín Frich, sponsors the Robejk Realists.
Second Life is financed by insurance company owner and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
Convicted corrupt and Czech gambling king Ivo Valenta has bought the Party of Privateers.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project of Andrej Babiš was inadvertently named by the mayor of Kroměříž Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter unto itself.
The mayor's got his billionaire recently.
He's Dalibor Grandpa, the owner of the Jablotron security firm.
In his own words, he's entering politics to do good.
Grandpa didn't do well in the mayor's uniform.
"I never dreamed of small goals", he said at a press conference.
That means my goal is to get the YES movement, the mayor's movement, to get 20 percent in the election.
Everyone was laughing.
But the grandfather's over-speech is rather symptomatic.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to run for the votes of the voters in the mayor's shirt, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
Grandpa supported Babis in the last parliamentary elections.
"Grandma is not a sharp orator and does not rule with the pleasant rhetoric of political snakes", he wrote about him before the 2013 election.
But he's definitely not into politics because he wants to improve himself.
Grandma will always be a hero to me.
He's willing to step out of his world, which he controls, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the mayor introduced him as a new reinforcement, he expressed his admiration for Granny again.
And he said he wanted the mayor's office to learn how to imagine possible cooperation with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his mind and stands by his side no matter what suit he wears.
Others may speculate that Grandma sends someone this clumsy to the City Hall to build her crate.
Others may ask if the head of Jablotron has broken up with the head of Agroferth in bad business and is looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.
But Djedk's first public appearance was not just about Babis.
Grandpa promised to send 10 million crowns to the city council for the campaign.
And he said if they need more money, he'll send more.
A few years ago, a similar statement would have been hard to resist.
In fact, the court-appointed thug Zdeněk Bakala before the 2010 elections, was spending millions on all parties.
The political divisions of the Vita Barta Security Agency, TOP 09 and the Citizen Democrats have come together to make almost 30 million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than $3 million to a political party.
If Grandpa's going into politics, he could at least learn the rules of the game.
Perhaps then he would not have to ask why politics has such a bad reputation in our country.
Grandpa crowned his first days in politics with a proposal to tax families with school-aged children.
People with college degrees come to us at about 50,000 a month.
The ones with the base on the low twenties.
A man with 50,000 is rich for the circumstances here.
The one with the 20 poor.
In the legacy vision of society, the poor pay their taxes honestly and the rich enjoy the benefits of a welfare state that they have little to do with.
The rich simply need to be helped not to live in poverty.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Grandma can shake hands.
The rest of us, and thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not always good people.
The question then remains, whom to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to play by them.
Those who do not consider their party members or citizens of the state as their employees and the land as their property.
And finally, those who want a rich country to be prosperous for all people, not just some.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex must have been $234 million cheaper.
Selling real estate is not always easy.
And sometimes, it doesn't help that he has 11 bedrooms, a great view of the ocean, or the fact that the property is being sold by U.S. President Donald Trump.
The sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex has brought the price down by an incredible £8 million.
This was reported by Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure on the property says, "Greetings, Donald J. Trump".
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the real estate company's association with the American president didn't justify extreme pricing.
Donald Trump had to reduce the price of his Caribbean mansion by an incredible £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
Even at a discount, a villa complex is worth about 76 average apartments in the centre of Prague.
And there's no wonder about it.
The impressive five-acre estate on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, numerous dining rooms, a gym, and other rooms.
It's made up of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and tennis court.
There are dozens of palms planted on the property.
The terrace has a beautiful view of the sea.
Real estate experts say the price reflects the fact that the president's connections are not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the usual property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
Speculation is that he paid around £15 million.
He was supposed to buy the property for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
But with the new price, it's second place.
The property in the neighbourhood was valued at £13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to end two practice sessions a day.
It's almost 11:00 a.m. and UCLA football players are cuddling at the sideline of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their sweaters and reveal their sweaty backs, a sure sign of the first day of training camp.
For most members of the team, these few minutes of idleness are supplemented by a lunch break.
The players enrolled in the summer semester will leave for their rooms after three hours of practice to study for their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for the 6:30 p.m. meeting this morning.
"These guys are going to be a real pain in the ass for the next three days", Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday's game was moved to Tuesday.
By eliminating two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to ease the players' burden - paradoxically, this makes training days even longer - at least until Friday, when final exams end.
That's why the first three UCLA practices are scheduled for 7:15 p.m. - to fit into the already overcrowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in Mora's six seasons as coach at Westwood, the Bruins' training camp starts a week earlier than last year and training is limited to the summer semester, which is also being affected by the decision to reduce the number of practices from two to one per day.
A total of 18 practices are scheduled through August 20, before the formal preparations for the first game against Texas A&M in September.
Mora has made it known that he supports the NCAA's decision, even though it has added another item to the already-crowded roster.
"Three or four days are very stressful for the players and it's very exhausting for them", Mora said.
But nobody gave up, everybody's trying.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down.
UCLA will be closed after the end of training camp, which won't be easy given the clear lines of surrounding grounds from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury Luskin Center hotel, which the players occupied after folding the safety net behind the goal stick.
Bruins players should be occupying the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms empty during the season, there could be a problem.
"The grounds will be guarded by the security service", Mora added.
Security is being taken care of, but it's not out of the question that someone could rent a room and record our training.
This stuff is a good trade.
Luckily, the hotel will be guarded by security, as will parking lot number eight.
We'll make the most of our resources.
I believe everything will be all right.
It's all planned.
Facebook plans to do more fact-checking to reduce the number of fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles for third-party review and display findings under original posts in an effort to combat so-called fake news, the largest social network said Thursday.
The company states in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display the results of the survey under the original contributions.
Facebook has been called one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced the U.S. presidential election last year.
Political debate is raging in Europe, French voters are being inundated with fake news about the May presidential election, and Germany is planning to fine the social media network if it does not remove angry posts quickly ahead of the September election.
In a separate statement issued in Germany on Thursday, Facebook said it was going to test a new fake news feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"Beyond seeing news verified by third parties, people are asking for more content to be better informed and to make informed decisions about what to share", Sara Su, Facebook's product news manager, wrote on her blog.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the "Related Articles" feature and is also working on further changes to reduce the number of fake news.
Creating a graphic novel: A Castle in England
The small Scotney Castle recently featured in a music video by the band Squeeze, and Margaret Thatcher also found refuge there during the 1970s and 1980s.
But from his cozy little spot on the Bewl River in Kent, England, Scotney witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history that inspired the furry Jamie Rhodes of Yorkshire - known for his fondness for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"Looking at the handwriting of a man who is 300 years after his death fascinates me", Rhodes says with a serious face.
When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection.
A Castle in England, a graphic novel, documents the lives of the families who lived at Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period, each story illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book inspired by archives, however: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of British Library inspired documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by the thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the '70s who worked for the Jacobites", he said.
It's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because back then you had to light a candle to read them.
Smelling the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I've been back in time.
I love the archives!
For someone so fascinated by old papers, the support of the National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to spend almost four months in the castle is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian New Castle, going through the archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the hyenas' heads on the walls and bottles that had been thrown in the trenches for centuries.
He walked the grounds and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking to the tenants, gardeners and occasionally the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
He drank whiskey and wrote at night.
Scotney's confidential history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not gain access to the documents until 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the site ten years later, the staff had only begun to penetrate the archives, which Rhodes described in words like aristocrats of many centuries throwing their hands around with the words, "Take it to the attic".
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps of property: "You may think a land dispute is boring", Rhodes said, "but I came across one case where two families were fighting over a barn.
Stop it people!
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a jumping-off point and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English Rebellion of 1381.
"I found a record of a rebellion at the castle in 1380, which was called in a book the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex", said Rhodes.
The English uprising actually started in this area, and I thought a rebellion was a good place to start.
Maybe they're connected after all.
Other stories are firmly linked to the castle's history - such as The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (which was not discovered until years after the coffin was discovered).
Rhodes' favorite family is the Darrells: "I was fascinated by the male generation - men were always in debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of the Darrells have dealt with this by marrying rich or old brides - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to rub heads with heirs.
With his stay at the castle over, Rhodes is looking for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness, where he was taking inspiration for his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was absorbed by nature.
But it's a strange place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left", he said.
I was like, "Now I'm going to get back to the real world".
Washington changes the terms of the green card
The media has reported the words of President Donald Trump about the new US immigration plan, which will also change the green card process.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50 000 per year as a result of stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the president.
The bill will be introduced to Congress soon.
This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers by changing the rules for issuing green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
"The new application process will favor English-speaking applicants who are well-funded and demonstrate abilities that will benefit our country", Trump said, according to the media.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on our guard
Just when it seemed like 2017 couldn't be any more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sex robots is coming online.
- I know.
Sex robots are really popular these days.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots needs to be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot's nails.
"People are making fun of them, but sales are going up and we need to be prepared to see them more and more", Sharkey said at the time of the report's release.
Modern sex toys are changing from inflatable pans to robotic women with silicone skin that is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course, artificial intelligence that mimics human behavior.
The user can "adjust" the robot to his image - from eye color and nipple shape to the appearance and color of his nails.
What's very disturbing, though, is that many robots have their own personality that would embarrass even the Stepford girl.
The modern inflatable dolls evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set his surrogate wife to various character traits, including shyness.
And then there's the True Companion sex robot woman Roxxxy Gold, who comes with pre-programmed personalities, including the frigid Farrah, who is shy, and the wild Wendy, who is adventurous.
"The Roxxxy Gold personality is set to match your personality to the fullest extent possible", says the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative or in a mood.
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - not to be confused with real interpersonal relationships, but rather the inferior female character traits and violent innuendoes - such as the frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
True Companion, on their website, likened the Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?" says the website.
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their origin and near-perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a shift away from ideal or gender equality toward the desire for compulsive sex with optional attachment.
Most men, of course, don't buy a robot wife, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of the general public's interest.
But this marginal interest can become a mirror set on the present modern age.
And most people aren't weird or violent unless they're given a free market excuse.
It's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women around the world are empowering themselves and a president is sitting in the White House, often speaking very scathingly about women.
The most terrifying aspect of the series The Handmaid's Tale is not what we see - the hanged bodies and the gouged eyes, but rather the reality of these visions.
The Handmaid's Tale is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems like a small step.
Sex robots should be as much like real women as possible (although at the level of a porn actress).
Their creators engineer them to be pleasant to the touch and to appear at first glance like a real woman.
But when it comes to their personalities, the robot can't replace the real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just walk away.
They have no job, no history, nothing that would encourage their independence or undermine their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they're pleasant slaves.
The 21st century is talking about servants.
NBA star on the green.
Curry is fighting in California for the cut.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry, despite a poor first start, never lost a game in the first round of the professional golf tournament.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player award winner played the Ellie Mae Classic, a lower-tier Web.com Tour tournament at Hayward, California, in the first round on 74 runs and will be fighting for the cut.
The Golden State player, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started off very nervous and his first shot ended up in the drink holder of a golf cart parked by the fairway.
Even then, he wasn't as accurate between the holes as he was under the basket, yet he left behind a dozen pros with a four-run overtime.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, having to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it kind of settled", Curry said, with a huge bang on his head.
It was very nervous, to fire the first shot in the tournament, but it was everything I hoped for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it right away", he added.
If Curry can break the cut, which is likely to be set two strokes under par, he'll be the first non-sport athlete to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I'm free of the trembling, I hope I can", said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed amateur and professional tournaments in the past.
At Hayward, he's competing in his first PGA Tour event.
He won a sponsorship exemption to the Ellie Mae Classic and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour is one category below the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
On the contrary, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
The Trump era is marked by political divisions that divide the American electorate and, on a micro scale, tear families apart.
During Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspapers were filled with advice on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We're supposed to be waiting for him to let go of his nerves.
But less attention is paid to Trump's ability to solidify the family.
I'm talking about this because I had a visit from my cousin in New York this week, a poet and left-wing fan who lives in Chicago and who has been a long-time Republican douche bag in our family.
She reminded me that being together in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, suddenly the whole family -- including all the Republican siblings she's had a political fight with for years -- is on the same wavelength.
At the family dinner table, it's a good thing; but it strikes me that in the larger context, it poses a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative impact of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about normalization and Trump, we're referring to the frightening possibility that his clowns might one day lose their appeal.
But there is an even more terrible long-term scenario where Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these days with nostalgia in my heart I remember Mitt Romney and his version of the crazy act - dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both of which seem very mild offenses compared to Trump.
After Trump leaves, it's enough for the next Republican candidate to be at least normal, which is a huge improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visit and took the kids to Central Park on the biggest roller coaster operated by the New York City Department of Parks -- you can't get a better use for your three dollars, unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the center cylinder is covered in glass laminate - clowns and animals rolling around, staring at their own shoulders in terror - a completely gloomy look and the whiny music strangely reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés soon become obsolete: the view from high buildings, the view from the panorama, instead of the atmosphere, and the reality of the city, which is beyond your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still can't get over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually Swiss cheese -- not counting the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage themed pub -- but a London Underground station.
The Central Park carousel, however, is a remarkably magical experience, so much so that it is a great place for two-year-old children to play, as well as two mature women.
If I could rate the rover, he'd earn the maximum points, but thankfully, nobody asks.
I had a similar experience this week at a store when I was asked to rate my credit card payment on a scale of one to five.
The coffee shop on the corner of my street is the same, except I can add a 15% tip to the rating for something I buy at the counter.
Not only does it slow down the otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is forced to look in the favor of the buyers when it's not necessary.
A woman at the store apologized to me with a smile when I reluctantly gave my credit card transfers a five-star rating.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cut wounds to his wrist, which the prison said he had inflicted himself after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder on appeal against the original murder conviction.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 with multiple gunshot wounds through the bathroom door of his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed he mistook her for a thief.
The plaintiffs have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and a trial would take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius could face an additional 15 years in prison.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a captive panda has given birth to a cub that mates in the wild.
It's a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the genome of the captive panda.
A Chang Che-chung center employee told New China that panda breeding is at great risk from crossbreeding.
At the end of last year, only 471 pandas were in captivity.
Only 2,000 of them survive in the wild.
So trying to get captive pandas to mate with wild ones is the first step in helping to conserve the species.
The 15-year-old Chao-chao was released into the wildlife reserve at the start of the panda mating season on March 11.
With a tracking device on her neck, scientists could observe her every move.
She met her chosen one 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a minor miracle, because male pandas are not considered the most successful lovers in the animal kingdom.
The males have a rather poor sense of when the female is ready, and they are often confused and unsure of what to do.
The cub was born healthy and, despite Chao-chao's exceptional appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams at birth.
The average newborn panda weighs 70 grams less.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, bTV quoted the statement.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained by Sithonian police in the early hours of August 1.
All were released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping and are imposing severe fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
The checks will be running all season.
The Ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilkov is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golf player Klara Spilková figures after the first round of the British Open in a split 50th.
The Kingsbarns, Scotland, court, went one stroke under par, playing three birdies and two bogey.
The 22-year-old Czech player is hoping to pass the cut for the first time in a famous major.
The $3.25 million grant went to American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round by a field record 64 runs, eight shy of a pair.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms because of the incident.
The Dutch food safety authority NVWA reported that it is investigating 20 percent of all poultry farms in the Netherlands, which means that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are harmless, according to Reuters.
The Authority stressed that the risk is only a limited number of egg types identifiable by specific numbers.
According to German authorities, the toxicity of eggs is low and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
The Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also took steps to close the farms, had not been imported into the Czech Republic recently.
However, the veterinarians shall take samples from eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland on whose markets the insecticide problem labels have appeared.
According to the veterinary authority, the eggs from Belgium were last on the Czech market in April and the eggs from the Netherlands in May.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
But in the Czech Republic, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is used in products against fleas, ticks and ticks.
However, it must not be administered to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) considers the preparation to be moderately toxic.
High doses of it lead to nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I'll miss it, says goalkeeper Sedláček and is looking for a commitment.
I'd like to catch ten more years.
"Maybe I'll go back one day", grinned the 27-year-old Farmer, who could start the season in a leather jersey.
It depends on whether he gets the engagement by the start of the new year.
What were your four years in Latvia like?
If I had to rate it like school, it'd be three.
I didn't catch much the first year, I had an experienced goalie in front of me.
I was studying.
The second year, I started fishing.
Before season three, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie, and I took turns with him.
Last year, I was supposed to be fishing all the time.
But we'd only gotten maybe five points in the first ten games, so the coaches started shooting.
My colleague caught more in the end.
But that's the way it's done.
They wanted to play him for next season.
How was life in Riga?
It's wonderful.
It's a small Prague.
It's a beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm going to miss him.
I made a friend there.
We're in our third year together, next year we're getting married.
So I brought something.
How tough is the KHL for goalies?
The top ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Sloan, who have to change their game style against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it.
That means playing more from behind, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem with the width of the field.
The difference is the Russians want to play for nothing.
They're shooting less, and even though they've got a half-empty goal in front of them, they're shooting better.
There's more shooting in the Czech Republic.
Didn't you have a problem traveling and moving across seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually done by playing, like, four games outside and then you get two days off.
How do Latvians feel about their KHL club?
Like the national team.
All of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball, as the national sport.
They're all fans.
Even if it didn't work, a lot of people came.
Did Dinam's presence in the KHL help Latvia to almost reach the quarterfinals of this year's World Cup?
KHL has been around since 2008, and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since then, their World Cup results have started to go up.
At the 2014 Sochi Olympics, they lost to Canada in the quarterfinals by a close 2-1.
That was an incredible result for them.
KHL's got them to the next level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
In Zlín, Roberts Bucharest has made his mark and before signing the contract, Ralfs Freibergs.
Why do so many people come here?
They're not just a bunch of douchebags, they're really good.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians being one of them.
It's a natural course.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still unengaged?
I knew at the beginning of February that I would not continue in Rize.
So we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have the budget for a goalie, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but they decided to go for someone else in the final.
So I'm training at home in Zlíná and I'll wait for something to come up.
You're not nervous about this?
That was me four years ago, when I left here, not knowing what was gonna happen.
The current situation is not the best, but I'm home after a while.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The only question is when and where I sign.
How realistic is it that you're going to start the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where it turns out.
Now I can only wait for the agent to come to terms.
Do you prefer a competition?
Last season wasn't one where I had a choice.
So I'm waiting for the phone call.
Government flight at Let continues.
In January of this year, I wrote in the article The Care of a Real Housewife? about the camp at Letech near Orlik.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I'll recall the main passages of the article.
The Leti camp has been talked about for years.
For readers who don't know exactly what it is, it might be best to look at the official website of the Pietní místo Lety cultural monument.
There, in the introduction to the historical overview, they will learn that the camp was located two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that from August 8, 1940, it served as a labor camp, from January 1, 1942, it was a concentration camp, and from August 2, 1942, it became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first prisoners were put on the Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, the largest transport to the extermination camp was 370 people.
There were 420 of them.
A very sad story of the immense suffering of human beings, caused by human beings and perverted ideologies.
There is no question that these events need to be constantly reminded of.
There is no question that the memorial should be held at the site of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During the socialist era, the camp was somewhat forgotten and in the 1970s, a pigsty was built nearby and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was unveiled in Letech.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy back and demolish the pigsty, but it hasn't happened yet.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its management falls under the Lidice Monument.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to conclude the porpinen.
So, very briefly, the facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
Until last fall, when the government approved the purchase of the pig and decided to have an expert opinion drawn up to determine the price.
The Minister of Agriculture says the government will buy the pigs afterwards.
According to the Minister of Culture Herman, "some numbers exist, but I would probably scuttle those plans if I went public with them".
We'll see what the expert opinion brings.
Some unofficial estimates put the price at hundreds of millions, others as high as a billion.
Either way, it's not going to be a cheap affair.
And just a few hundred yards from the former camp stands a monument, which the state invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction was nicely funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is probably not a threat, it would still be a waste of money in my opinion.
Don't the government have other priorities?
The monument, a dignified place of mourning, stands by the will of history in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that took place and anyone who wants can pay homage to the memory of those who suffered and were murdered.
I don't see any reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the place as clean as possible.
The trusted assets, including taxpayers' money, should be managed by a proper steward by the person responsible, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic.
At least with one like your own firm!
Of course, the finance minister and the deputy prime minister are not the whole government.
But still, in view of the above facts, I perceive the slogan of the ANO leader as just an empty pre-election proclamation.
I went to see the place in May.
Very decent driveway, modified parking, replicas of wooden camphouses.
One exhibit, another integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with seating and a view of its own pitch, made of stones placed in a moderate slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the importance of this place as they fit and belong.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would be possible, for example, to conserve some of the exposed bases and make them at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
This is where Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could step up his efforts.
If he succeeds in getting the government to buy the pig with state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But a new study suggests the opposite: A diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects as many as 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Although patients are usually told to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan, found in a protein, helps build immune cells that promote intestinal resistance.
Study leader Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure that harmful microbes are broken down from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales tilt to the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
In the study, the researchers detected the presence of immune cells that promote tolerance in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
These bacteria require the presence of tryptophan, one of the building blocks of proteins, to make cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We found a link between a species of bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri, which is a common part of the gut microbiome, and the development of cells that promote tolerance in the body.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.
He also suggested that if the same is found to be true in humans, then combining L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory gut environment.
As a postgraduate researcher, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance in the body, and she found that one group of test mice had these cells, while another group of the same mice had no cells.
She concluded that one group of mice had a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally inhabit the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice's intestines were tested using DNA sequencing, and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that the other group of mice lacked.
So mice that were kept in a sterile environment and lacked the gut microbiome -- so they didn't develop this type of immune cells -- were given L. reuteri -- and they developed immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without the bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
The immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the liquid, it was shown to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-octanoic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent, and when they halved the dose of tryptophan, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in the tryptophan-related genes have been detected in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: "Everyone should probably strive to develop these cells, because they control inflammation of the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri may increase the cell population.
Jose Mourinho considers the signing of Nemanja Matić and his move to Manchester United to be 'genius'.
Manchester United have added the "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matić - at least that's what Jose Mourinho thinks after the full-back made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Matić, who signed for £40 million, came on in the first leg of the 2-1 win in Dublin - the final pre-season fixture before United's UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as a full-back alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, as he did not participate in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matić was out of form and played only 45 minutes, which according to Mourinho needs to be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he's experienced, intelligent and has a genius mind - he thinks like a football player", Mourinho said.
We're gonna get him back in shape as soon as possible.
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first game at the Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his starting eleven for the next season.
An independent source said this week that Mourinho still wants to sign three more players, but insists the club has done a "fantastic job" bringing three of the four most important players to the squad.
"Thank you to the club for helping me get three of the four players", he added.
I'd be more pleased with four out of four, but I'll admit they did their best for me.
The challenge of a lifetime for the King of the Chicken Skins, the Lady of the Peaches.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This promising picture has been painted by a new program on TV Prima Zdenkov Academy.
The pear immediately took a chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to join your cooking academy because, I swear to you, I think I can learn a lot from you", he challenged him in a video on social media.
And since the two have been at it for years, the Ark has not forgotten to irritate him this time.
"In return, I can teach you sweets from diet chicken, American cucumbers, or I can invite you to a water and show you why fried cheese is popular", Peach grumbled.
He's really serious about his involvement in the new Pohlreich show.
It's time to take it to the next level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what does the boss say", said Flash.
But Pohlreich didn't comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show, Yes, Boss!
Only Prima responded to Peaches' participation in the culinary academy by saying that he considers the whole thing his personal activity, which goes beyond television.
He hit the ground running with Hruška Pohlreich in December 2004 as his first cook.
In a matter of days, over 300,000 copies were sold!
The new show that Prima introduced yesterday at the fall broadcast schedule press conference is the real cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve episodes.
In the final episode of his show Now the Chef in November 2014, Zdeněk had a crossed pear beaten on the back of his shirt.
If he had my face on it, I'd be laughing a lot.
"I'm just smiling at the pear - it's a healthy fruit and has lots of vitamins", said the Ship.
They're not sure about the ship's culinary arts.
"Cooking like Lady Peaches is not even a possibility at home, because I'm not going to let gastropunk into my house", the boss is clear.
I respect the Pollack's very much, I even make chicken on honey according to him.
But his recipes will definitely not appear in my show", said the peach.
He's a fool!
He's not a chef to me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomical illiterate or moron", said Pohlreich of Hruszko at one lecture.
"I'm not 20 to wave my hand at them, but I don't solve them anymore", said Hruška, on account of the insults he had uttered.
British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock a car and a house by waving
A British inventor has become the first person in the country to have a microchip inserted into his body, and with a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the doors of his home and office and even start a car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam has had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and is now offering the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to use technology to make their lives easier.
The implantation process and the follow-up to treatment procedures are supervised by Dr Geoff Watson, an anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the entire procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam also offers a service for the exchange of microchip-compatible door and car locks, priced at £300 each.
A married father of one has had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
The White House props cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn for the American manufacturing celebration last month came in at $24,000, according to Navy records published by TIME magazine.
The green white Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One with the President on board, was the highlight of the July 17 program at the White House, which was a showcase of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials were touring the product show from all 50 states.
A Connecticut helicopter was parked next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a fork lift from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, requesting the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn in a "emergency" event, according to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of this momentous event", the commander of HMX-1 wrote in an e-mail to his superior, the deputy commander of the Navy for aviation the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17th at approximately 7:00 a.m. for the parade, scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m., and would remain in place until the entire site was cleared, which was scheduled between 6:00 and 9:00 p.m.
The e-mail also said that if there was a delay in the departure from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for the return flight due to the working hours regulations.
The original crew stayed that evening, along with the helicopter and a security team.
From the records obtained by TIME magazine, it was unclear whether a second crew was eventually sent.
The Hatch Act prohibits government officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible infringements of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a Hatch Act violation and were assured that everything was in order", the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're being blocked", the deputy commander wrote back.
This "Made in America" parade was designated by the White House as an official event and therefore would not be covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
In his participation at the event, the president pushed for health care reform, which passed the Senate and spoke of efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of air transport such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when they travel.
However, their presence purely for presentation purposes is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane flew in the background at his first-ever campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida.
"The White House is pleased with the 'Made in America' show, which showcased products from all 50 states that are made by Americans from American materials", said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often practice landing in the Washington area and on the South Lawn, and practice possible arrivals with the President of the United States at the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump was attending the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of the crew's ongoing training, a government official said.
The helicopter unit flew for another 11 hours on the same day as part of "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said no additional props were paid out of taxpayer money.
Sikorsky's spokesman stated that the company was not involved in any way in the negotiations to display the helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for presidential flights and the exact costs associated with the parade are difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly rate for fiscal year 2017, DoD expense reimbursement for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records show time 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopters are well below that amount.
"It is very misleading to list taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimates for the reimbursement of expenditure", Walters said of the whole matter.
These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual costs.
The Commission notes that the State aid granted to the airport in question is not compatible with the internal market.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer at the time advocated the use of helicopters for the purpose of the parade.
"The idea of the show, which is taking place this week, is to showcase products made in the U.S"., said Spicer.
I am aware that the Sikorsky Corporation and the State of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to the defense of our state and that they are providing employment to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that countless American citizens have been involved in making.
This is a fact worthy of remembrance.
It's unclear whether Trump was also looking at the helicopter during his tour of the South Lawn, but it's safe to say that he was behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back at the White House, Trump approached Sikorsky's representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the President, "I own three of them".
A young woman was stranded in a swamp near Lake Mead, and the police were on their way to her.
The girl left for the beach around 2:00 a.m. on Sunday.
Instead of bathing, she was trapped in the swamp.
When she decided to call the police on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent of her battery.
"As a result, the police soon lost contact with her", said police spokeswoman Ivana Balaková.
Several police patrols were sent to the location she described, but finding the young woman was not easy.
"Some of the police had to wade through the reed swamp hundreds of meters before they felt the solid ground under their feet again", Balak said.
And she was also missing.
The police were guided by the direction of her cry for help.
"To avoid losing this connection, they arranged for her to count down", said the spokesman.
Police didn't find the woman until 3:45 in the swamps near Borny.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
That's why the ambulance called took her to the Chesapeake Hospital.
Grandpa's connection to the STAN?
A bride-to-be becomes a saleswoman.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project seekmeusny.cz, it's like a billionaire is basically telling voters that the STAN is suffering from a shortage of decent people.
He also claimed that the politically uncoordinated group of lesser-known mayors and independents actually had no national program for the parliamentary elections.
Her candidate is simply a decent man, regardless of his political views, after an interview with Grandpa.
That's how Vittorio started, and it didn't go so well.
By hunting down decent people and personalities who might replace some mayors in the candidates, which Gazdík admitted, Djedek also cancels the popular argument of the head of STAN that the greatest value of the movement is precisely the politically verified and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians even according to polls.
They're just replacing the hastily collected unknowns.
The total break with the People's Party, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdík explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity in the candidates of the People's Party.
But if STAN was only a few people's idea of identity back then, then with the arrival of Grandpa, the whole identity game is over.
Not only did Gazdík long stand against ANO Andrey Babis, but at the first joint press conference, Dedek, who publicly praises Babis, stated the following: "My goal is for the ANO movement, that is, the Mayor's movement, to win twenty percent in the upcoming elections".
Let's hope he didn't get the wrong move.
Grandpa is a successful businessman and a billionaire, and it's no accident.
He often talks about politics in the same way as Grandpa, but unlike him, he won't own a political brand.
For some time now, STAN has been more like a reality show than a real political party, and Grandpa's helping hand seems to make the bride-to-be even more of a sales girl.
For a while, STAN went with TOP 09, then with the humanities, and now it's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone answers.
Police dogs practiced helicopter flying at the Bridge
Explosive-detecting and search dogs practiced helicopter flyovers today at Lake Bridge.
The police dog must not be afraid of flying, said head of the police kinologists of the Usteck region, Petr Tomášek.
Training a police dog takes about two years.
At the bridge, they trained both adult training dogs and those who are just going through training.
In addition to the standard training, which involved detecting the lake's surroundings for the presence of sharp explosives and searching for the missing figurine, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So as soon as the helicopter gets bored, the dog can go to work, so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter's path.
"The helicopter has arrived, the dog is going and immediately looking", said Tomášek.
A dog that is restless or unable to start work immediately on the helicopter ride is excluded from training.
"They are usually left by dog-walkers in the garden", Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs in the Eastern District with different specialties.
German sheep are predominant, but Belgian sheep are also increasing.
The dog owner's been taking care of him since he was a puppy.
"He is raising him himself, preparing him for the service that the dog will do for us", Tomášek added.
The animal shall undergo repeated veterinary examinations which may reveal any medical handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and uninjured, it passes its first test at 20 months.
"It takes about two and a half to three years to get to acute intervention", Tomášek added.
The length of time a police officer is on duty depends on the dog's health.
They usually serve eight to ten years.
They usually live with their owners.
Narcos Season 3 trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and the Cali Cartel becomes the center of a hit Netflix series
Despite the season two finale of Narcos, with the revelation of Pablo Escobar's killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service - the first named one has already received the first trailer and a wallpaper of other negative characters.
In season three, the DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world, the Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four powerful mobsters, they operate like a Fortune 500 company, only with the difference that they escalate violence and bribe more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is the brain of the operation, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in control of New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character recruiting American and Colombian drug lords to fight the war.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
Narcos season three will premiere on September 1st.
The UN says Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if they involve all members of society, including women, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the UN relief mission, said that local elections are contested by hundreds of women, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked", he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women are involved, as can all the related processes that are linked to elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are scheduled for April 5.
The Taliban have issued several threats against the electoral process, which is moving the international fighting to the next level.
In this year's election, for the first time ever, a democratically elected government is peacefully handing over power to a successor government.
Haysom said that strong women's roles would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that of the total 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
A unique brewery brewing beer again.
Here's to a good beer for the resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery back to life in Lobcz near Mšen a few years ago.
The brewery, first mentioned in 1586, has a Renaissance core and was converted to steam-powered operation in the 19th century.
The years of prosperity followed, when the brewery was famous for its dark beers.
Unfortunately, production was halted during World War II, and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have been a state property.
The damage was done by the brewery owners after 1989.
The abandoned site was devastated and torn down for building material.
But in 2007 a new hope was born in the form of new owners, architects Jany and Pavlo Prouzov.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have been and are carefully studying archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery is the same as it was in the 19th century, when its golden age began.
Their work was recognised by the declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the building became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trail.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing beer was also ceremoniously renewed.
To taste the wonderful lobster beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokorin, visit the brewery's picnic area.
The beer is brewed with coconut water from protected landscapes, malt from lobster fields, and zate hops.
In the lounge, you'll taste the traditional light bed, but also dark beer and specials.
And don't miss the brewery tour, held on Saturday and Sunday at noon and 2:30 p.m.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest forts of its kind on a global scale?
Such a unique structure was to be the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléř, on top of a terraced ridge above the village of Babí.
Originally, it was to consist of up to 12 bunkers connected by a vast underground.
This was to be the headquarters, the barracks, the munitions depots, the materials, the power plant, the engine room and the hospital.
But the Munich Agreement ended the construction.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground tunnels were drilled.
Thanks to enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who began the reconstruction of the unique building in the early 1990's, you can visit it.
The basement is 75 percent open!
The area includes, in addition to the T-S 73 infantry barracks with exposition and underground, an armed light fortification, two deployed infantry bunkers, trenches and the training path of Fortified Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, a cozy balcony and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building is listed alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Trajan's harbor near Rome, and the Assyrian palaces of Nineveh and Nimrod.
The Chotesh Monastery, originally from the early 13th century, which today is mainly a massive four-wing convent building over a beautiful garden.
A list he's gotten on, but unfortunately, it's a list of unique buildings in danger of extinction.
But the enthusiasts are not willing to give up and are organizing many events in support of the monastery.
One of them is the next year's Evening for the Khoteshov Monastery this Saturday, August 5th, where Vladimir Miskik, Ivan Hlas, among others, will perform, you will see the swordplay and look at the sites of the beautiful vast buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
But most importantly, you'll enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Identify the plant with one click.
Students in herbalism and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by a new free Pl@ntNet app.
If they're wondering what plant they just came across on their walk, this app will give them a tip.
All they have to do is take a picture of the plant, and the app will automatically identify the species.
The new app, which is available for both iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education at Bratislava's Mountain Park as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools also participated in the project, taking pictures with teachers and adding plants from their surroundings to the application database.
A newly developed French app is available for free download on the City's Secret Life website.
The main goal of the French programmers was to get as many people as possible to contribute their images to the app, and thus increase the number of plants that the app can recognize.
"Children who have a tablet or a mobile phone in their hands can go out into the forest", said Ivana Poláčková, the project coordinator.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of a flower, leaf or fruit of a plant, the application can recognize its name in a few seconds, which is then assigned to the photo in both Czech and Slovak.
In France, the Secret Life of the City project has allowed us to translate the app into Slovak and Czech.
Therefore, users are welcome to contribute a plant image that is not yet present in the database after creating an account in the application.
"The French will evaluate it and then add it to the database", Poláčková informed.
GMB's concerns about the investment in the McVitie's plant in Glasgow
The unions are demanding assurances from the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie's about a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish Trade Union GMB stated that the company is silent for the time being about any investment in the Tollcross factory.
The factory employs more than 500 people, who produce, among other products, Hobnob cookies and Rich Tea.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, stated that over the previous few years it had invested more than £5 million in the whole area.
She added that employees and trade union representatives would be among the first to be informed in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In letters to the contractor, the Scottish unions of GMB expressed their concern that McVitie's would not deliver on its promises to finance and modernise its production lines.
GMB chief organiser Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we have not received a clear response from the developer regarding the company's needs and future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying to our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and the staff come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working in the factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social exclusion.
In terms of jobs, wages and benefits - and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising living costs and declining manufacturing - the east of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturer like McVitie's.
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The construction manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible as we value the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB's employees and representatives in Tollcross was held two months ago and many issues were openly discussed at that meeting.
We have told our employees that, as with all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: "In recent years we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, particularly in production lines and streamlining operations.
We greatly value the heritage of Tollcross and the site here, and in the event of any changes to the operation of the plant here, the employees and union representatives will be informed immediately.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow in their bid to get Neymar on their side after they have made £189 million, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but did this French team warn Barcelona of their record-breaking attack three years ago?
The sensational move has stirred up the summer transfer market, with the Ligue 1 club set to surpass more than double the previous record fee for Paul Pogba's move to Manchester United, who paid £89 million for him last season.
Once confirmed and completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the highest paid professional athlete in the world - after taxes, he will be earning over £500,000 a week from PSG.
Barcelona are outraged by the way Neymar has been released from his contract, despite a source confirming that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world made aware of this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned any club that would be interested in taking on one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not afraid because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, then we will definitely get one of their players", Al-Khelaifi said.
We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they'll face consequences.
Barcelona seem to have crossed the imaginary line when they expressed interest in PSG defender Marc Verratti this summer.
PSG have made it clear that they will not allow the Italian international to leave under any circumstances, so it is possible that Barcelona are now taking a bitter pill for their bold move with the departure of Neymar.
Who's going to explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly understood rules?
Donald Trump has waived sanctions against Russia.
The day before, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And the day before, Trump had written that China was doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it would not continue to do so.
Even the idea of sanctions is a little bit of a bummer.
You can't put that stuff in one bag.
Maduro's Venezuela is indeed on the road to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is just not acting the way the American president would like it to.
Russia is a chapter to itself.
But if one were to summarize all this in such a way that even the average voter, American, European or otherwise, could understand what it is and what the rules system is based on sanctions policy, it would be a nearly impossible task.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only questioning what President Obama has already planned, just giving it a go.
So why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe was afraid that if Trump won the US elections, they would embrace Putin and lift sanctions.
It's a terrible thought.
In practice, it's the other way around.
With Trump, sanctions are not relaxed, they're tightened.
But Europe is even more frightened.
German Chancellor Zypries says Trump's sanctions are a violation of international law.
So kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there's no kosher or EU sanctions against Russia.
The head of the European Commission, Juncker, once again complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
You mean, sanctions are supposed to be so weak that they don't endanger anyone?
The common voter is batting.
For three years, he's heard that the fate of the anti-Russian sanctions depends on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire in Ukraine.
Now it turns out that this is about the EU's energy security.
The voter is going even further.
Russia is being sanctioned for getting too far where it shouldn't.
China is being blamed for not assembling enough.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his own country's borders.
All these punishments or even considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system, an order, a rule?
I'm not thinking of working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš has married, crossed the Republic with his visionary book and finalized the electoral program.
He's already done all the candidates except for Pardubice.
He said he had not interfered with them in any significant way.
He even agreed to let the Moravian-Silesian army be led by the hechtman and the shadow education minister of the ANO, Ivo Vondrak.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a deputy or a captain", Babiš confirmed his earlier position.
You've angered a lot of lawmakers and state politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors should run towns and cities themselves, with only managers.
You mean it?
That's not what happened.
I'm a supporter of direct democracy, we elect the president directly, and I believe we should still elect mayors and mayors.
I don't talk about interfering with the legislature in my book, they can be there.
The question is how many.
When I was presenting your book What I Dream When I Sleep, I overheard you talking about abolishing the House of Representatives.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct election and reducing the number of deputies.
New York City, with nine million people, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1,171 deputies.
And the mayor is being blamed for not building enough and not having done big projects, but she doesn't have the competence.
The same is true of the government that has been run by only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did it right.
The current Prime Minister is not in charge, he's just moderating the debate.
It can't work like that.
Is that why you want to push for a majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to enforce.
The only change on the agenda is a one-round election for the Senate.
We also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and an amendment to the Rules of Procedure of the House to avoid unnecessary exhibition of Members who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to show off at the meetings of the House.
It's definitely not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator, you will run the government, control the 101st Congress, abolish the counties and the Senate, and, through grateful mayors and mayors, control the entire country.
It's not like that.
There's nothing wrong with debating the number of MPs.
French President Macron has announced a reduction of the legislative body by a third, whereas there are 57,000 French people for every legislator, while here it is 17,000 Czechs.
But nobody accuses Macron of threatening democracy.
Even if someone wins the election in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms to prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
The odds for the majority are high, just look at Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like that is going to happen with the YES movement.
We just need a team in government that works for the people, not their parties or departments.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree to raise only the salaries of teachers, cultural workers and social workers.
Why did they vote me out and add 21 percent to the GIBS members who are already taking 60 grand?
Would you step on that as Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister is supposed to intervene when ministers are being uncouth, confusing the government with a travel agency and wanting to do business with state money like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers should not argue in government, but should discuss their differences outside.
The cabinet has to have the finished material, there's no room for coalition splits, power votes and deals, there's a decision to be made.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when the ministers are mostly partisan?
Above the parties is constitutional law.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not work, and he fired Babis from the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
But if he's a personality and has leadership skills, there's no need for such a hollow gesture.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Have you decided who you'd recommend for Treasury Secretary?
I don't think about it, because we're probably not even in that government, nobody wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I did that was so terrible.
There's no need to be so skeptical.
The city council has got a businessman named Dede who'd like to work with you. Maybe he'll win the People's Wing for your favorite George Piglet.
I don't think you are.
The CPSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO, while Václav Klaus Jr. may be promoted in the ODS, who will not be against it either.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice President of ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the field of economics.
So the now-mormons are a viable coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has a political background, ran as a puppet of Vít Barta for the VP, then he was raising money from the Dawn for his company, there was some coup.
He's obviously a distinctive personality.
A little brown, though.
If I take his program, there's a broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, you can agree with that.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder if you'd accept a man who has xenophobic views, speaks at demonstrations with sticks, and wants to leave the EU?
We are not considering working with Mr. Okamura's party, I can't imagine.
It's clear he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the communist's tacit support for your minority government?
I can't imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It's gonna be a winner-to-second-in-line negotiation, but God knows who's gonna win and who's gonna be second.
Of course, it's important that they be able to agree on the agenda of a coalition government.
Let's go back to your attempt to run the state as a corporation.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything slip away, never decided.
Coalition affairs like CEF or EGAP did not work.
I mean, Saturday is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
Once he did, the CZEC took control of the Czech government.
It's incredible that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by the CEEC management, which he imposes on the Minister of Finance, how to vote at the CEEC General Assembly.
If you were to become Prime Minister, would you change the personnel structure of the Supervisory Board and change the top management of CEZ?
Jesus, if I'm Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not yet.
Rumor has it the CEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He'd like to trade a good cooperation with the SSRD for an even better one with ANO.
Maybe after the election, things will pick up.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have a lobbyist for the Humble or the Pink, I'm a separate unit, and I'm not dealing with this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to change the leadership of the CEZ, the Czech Television or the General Health Insurance, the institution you criticize?
I want the CEEC to be a transparent society.
For years, he's been doing what he wants, on the backs of the traditional political parties.
You just have to look up Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he has the majority in the Czech Republic, he never led it, he was only there in numbers, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter to me.
CEZ is supposed to take the Dukovans, value them, put them in a subsidiary, arrange financing, run a supply competition or find a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state should finance and build new nuclear reactors is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her shows are running a permanent campaign against me, but I don't have, and I won't have, the authority to fire anyone.
But to control it.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that the public pays about 7.2 billion dollars a year in public broadcasting fees, but they don't really know how these institutions are run.
How come they don't know?
After all, the Parliament approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the position of CEOs and CEOs.
Look at the news reports negotiating this superpower pact of Sobotka Kalousek that's always worked.
This applies to both the current parliamentary commission on leaks from investigative files and lex Babis.
And Saturday was so stupid, he let Kalouske push him to kick me out of the government, which added up to the top 09% but the CPSU took it away.
They fear the disruption of their corrupt system, so they talk about the threat to democracy by the Babis.
No one is immune.
What do you think of the articles describing how the first vice-president of ANO, Jaroslav Faltýnek, builds up his power by putting his son on the board of Tepláren Brno and arranging contracts with the lawyer Květoslav Hlín's friend with city and state companies such as Prague Transport Company or České dráhy?
That's what we're always arguing about.
I don't like it, and I've blamed him several times.
Faltýnek argues that the lawyer in question works for substantially lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the Sokan, have never had a corruption affair, no Pelto, Kratochwil, Bresino.
If there was any sign of clientelism, we would fire the person immediately.
I'm uncompromising in this regard.
If something like this happens, we'll get rid of whoever it is, no matter who it is.
