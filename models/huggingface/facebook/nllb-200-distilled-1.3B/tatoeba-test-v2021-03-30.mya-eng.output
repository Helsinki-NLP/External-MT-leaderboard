Tom is our friend.
It'll be your toothbrush.

I'm curious to see which one you'd win.
The morning before, Tom was playing golf.
I don't really understand the question you're asking.
At that time, I was probably still taking French speaking classes.

It's your carelessness that has caused all this.
I feel the same way.
I have to go shopping with Tim.

I think you should answer your own question.
I put butter in it.
I just want to see him happy.
How many eggs do you want me to buy?

Tom didn't look where he was going, so he fell on the dock.
These glasses go with you.
What does that mean?

Which do you like better, an apple or a banana?
Where no one else has it, it's there.
How long has it been broken?

I know you have.
How many water horses did you catch today?
It's not easy to make women happy.

Just wait a minute.
Tom rarely arrives late for an appointment.
I'm learning Burmese.
I looked at my watch and realized I was an hour early.
Tom slipped into the water.
Do you climb mountains like Tim?
Let me see if the beer is cold.

We're still investigating this.
This is the first time this has happened.
I forgot to call you, and I'm sorry.
Yes, it is.
When will the roses in your garden bloom?

Do you always go hiking with Tim?
Tom and I spoke French to each other.

Do one good thing every day.
They follow.

I met this girl.
What do they want from me?
Tom has climbed in many countries.
I don't like this website.

Hello. How are you?
I'm a student of his.
Your room is at the end of the lecture.
It was a horror movie.
What time is it now?
And Tom seemed very worried.
"Where did you put your cock?" "I left it at school".
I'm sorry I forgot to call you.
It's not too late to turn back.
Is it cold outside?
I want to see you laugh.
Tom seems very unhappy.
I'm looking for someone to play chess with.
I feel the same way.
I think Tom should stay home with Mary.
And Tom loves to fool his friends.

I want to play the piano well.
I'm only five minutes late, sir.
Tom is playing outside with his friends.
