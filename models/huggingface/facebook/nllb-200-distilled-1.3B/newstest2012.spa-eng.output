Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code that condemns opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the former prime minister's imprisonment, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing a deal with Russia that was disadvantageous for Ukraine over the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, the appeals court has the obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge by the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code that sentenced the former prime minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
It required 226 votes to pass.
The Victory of Libya
The story of Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war.
It remains to be seen who is the winner.
As is customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of whether they are moderates or radicals.
The National Transitional Council has put into effect the traditional law, Sharia, which we already know in a way.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because thieves will have their hands cut off.
Women can forget about emancipation and apostates waiting to be executed and so on.
Instead of the dictator himself, society, made up of warring tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya an order will be established which we cannot even imagine and which we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably did not suit the Libyans mentioned above.
It is not surprising, in fact, that Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of the infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, NATO's attacks were not led by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each successful intervention.
When you look for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a gunfight that the Islamists and our politicians are using to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally with no guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we did not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals have no problem expelling the crusaders.
But without occupation, will the oil companies get their hands on Libyan black gold just by good words?
It is quite possible that it will not, but it may be that the West will finally be able to boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the Sharia followers don't cross us.
A new era of crisis is beginning
France and the rest of Europe are on the hunt for the investor hunter
A statistical whirlwind has swept Europe
Individual states have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the interquarterly period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates for economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5% as forecast, France's by 0.4%
Both countries have published data for the second quarter, in Germany it improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the forecast 0.1%), although in France there was a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year on year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the interquarterly period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic development is taking shape.
The results are even worse than analysts' predictions.
Main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year on an annual basis, but has stagnated in the last four months.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0,5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% year on year.
The interest on your ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest on Italian and Spanish bonds has risen to critical limits.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest rates on Czech ten-year bonds remain at 4%, although the situation in the area is worsening.
In Germany there are voices that say the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs are qualifying for the European Championship.
They won 1-0 and celebrate the qualifying with a bonus of 200 million.
The football team is on the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jiráček, the victory was won 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended fantastically from the attacks of the home team, so that they will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the party's development in detail in a detailed report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also the excellent game of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins didn't press until the second half.
The two losers of the match were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who missed two big occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup, so the national football coffers will receive a reward of approximately 200 million crowns.
From the first few minutes, we had a good offensive game.
Both teams were just trying to keep the lines straight and played nothing else around the middle of the field.
There was no pressure from the home players in the first half, kicking the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense was able to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed outside the facility at noon Tuesday and then chanted death slogans to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around the nuclear technology center where uranium is worked in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday.
They intend to prove that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in a recent report found that Iran is, by all indications, striving to acquire nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students began praying at noon outside the Isfahan nuclear facility and then chanted death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, which would aim to paralyze Iran's nuclear program, Israeli sources say not only the Isfahan plant but also the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched, would be hit.
Daily menu for an obese child: no breakfast and dinner with sausage
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with overweight, with overweight affecting 9% of the school population and obesity at 5%.
Most obese children come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, according to current research.
It demonstrates once again the importance of the environment in which one grows up for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, for example, obsessive children eat sausages at least twice as often as children from normal-weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had eaten chips the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence".
In families with overweight children, there is no practice of playing sports, which is applicable to most families today, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last school year and involved almost 900 primary school children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a coincidence", supported by the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12 thousand children from 4th to 8th grade have participated in the project.
A proper diet and sufficient exercise in the family are key factors that significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obese children.
"Only half of the children surveyed said they have five meals a day according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet", says one of the survey results.
No breakfast but with sausage for dinner
Specialists warn that in healthy development, details are also important, such as having a set time for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each person eats breakfast alone.
But the worst part was finding out that 10% of households don't have breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in families with obese children, insanity fries are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sugary soft drinks daily (70%).
In general, more than 40% of the children surveyed play sports, but this figure is reduced to less than half, just 15%, among their parents.
Make up your own diet
The next phase of the study enabled the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal from a healthy dietary point of view".
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"The popularity of sugary soft drinks is particularly alarming", warns the final report of the study.
The main food is the palm pulp, followed closely by the poultry.
Practically, children always reject vegetables and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changing to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if given the right information.
"In the control group of study participants, who completed the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program 'Obesity is not a coincidence,' there was in many cases a major shift in favour of the principles of healthy eating", the study results state.
The problem is that many children would prefer plain water to sugary drinks.
Children would also more often choose poultry and fish as their main meals on the questionnaire and restrict their consumption of sweet foods and flour products.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a little bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that was gonna go.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the entertainment world.
And it's going to get worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical work awaits us
And although the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it no longer fits a pin.
We've even studied with the principal, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress the woman who does not have perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone's short-necked, someone's got a stylized figure without the right curves and someone's overweight.
The stylist must be able to smooth out wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We've been given some tricks on how to make the body of women like Jennifer Lopez stand out, with huge breasts and hips but a narrow waist and at the same time not dress her in a way that's too defiant.
If, for example, the difference between your waist and hips is so great that your skirt or pants do not fit, it may be worthwhile to have at least one extra piece of fabric tailored.
You will not be sorry, for the clothes that fit perfectly are priceless.
A tailored skirt will feel much better than one that keeps moving, standing, dancing on your waist, etc.
The stylized body can afford to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or draped.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am glad that I have the whole week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the task at hand, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who must design two costumes: one for the day and one for the evening.
The current look, the fashion style that suits the person in question must be taken into account.
I've been asked to dress Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it's much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently put on about a hundred kilos (please note the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
Dresses have to be cut from magazines or searched online and printed, then graphically crafted.
The moodboard, which is what the complete result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of styling.
The stylist therefore does not only dress physically, but also deals, for example, with product pages in magazines (concrete topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
We were told all about it by the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But all this is already left for Sunday.
The stylist has to have a global vision.
The three special guests cheered the Saturday conference with information on all kinds of bodies.
The stylist Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, crucial.
Thus, such a trench coat can be worn classically with jeans and a T-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with high heels and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or you can just twist it around and pull it up your neck to get a totally different picture.
"Play with it", he urged.
The advice I value most is this: "To get started, you need to know all the rules first".
"You can break them later", said Jakub.
I finally get why we memorize all these formulas, what combines with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know a stylist has to have more types of clothes in stock than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story to have ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides photos, the clothes work in combination with other garments, all of which are different from what you wear in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that image and style alone are, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is still no clear trend towards using the services of stylists.
Even famous people find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks for our services, you have to keep in mind that they will most likely tell you a size that is very different from your actual (minor) size.
Then you just have to google and find out if the heart magazines have already written about the subject, if a certain celebrity has gained weight/thinned, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist should not just be oriented in fashion, but also understand the outfit.
During your work, you must above all communicate with the people you see, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't make a fool of himself, he defends his opinions.
"When a director hires you to sort out her wardrobe and complete it with nice clothes, you can't just take everything and throw it away and say, 'Fuck, that's horrible.'"
"Find at least a couple of things you can consider and recommend for someone to wear", says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit into the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
It's attached around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as bags or hats), special clothes hook pincers in front, if it was larger (pincers and other types of hooks are not allowed, because they could damage the fabric), or a sewing set.
To avoid being passive listeners and to put something into practice, we have learned to put on the soles of our shoes.
Even during photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, you could damage the sole and even more so the outside.
And We did not make it but a covering and a covering.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so we wouldn't accidentally damage them.
So you had to be very skillful.
Mario has given me joy in praising my work without reservation.
I'm not really good at those skills, to tell you the truth.
This is just a small part of everything we've heard all weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've realized that pursuing styling professionally is not a smooth road, but I don't care what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run, you race all over America.
The review
A journey, initially carefree, is complicated by a series of improper oversights of a routine journey during the morning shift.
I would like to say that I am very pleased that the Commission has taken this opportunity to make a statement on the subject.
The new installment, to which The Run is added to the title, raised high expectations even before its release.
It promised to give new air to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, as a result of what was shown, it appears as a game that should not end up being an action genre again.
We also felt curious about what the inserted scenes would look like, where the main character gets out of the car and walks on his own foot.
As is often the case with NFS series, the results did not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total count you lose points because of absurd errors, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In fact, they cannot even be called errors, but are rather the incomprehensible reluctance of programmers.
The adventure starts off well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You get behind the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
This shows that each race is run on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
That way, you don't even remotely feel like the game is always offering the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graphics is equivalent to previous installments of the series.
So it's not a big deal.
But a walk in the desert, the autumn landscape, or the high snow-capped mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, the careers are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you encounter a sandstorm that diminishes visibility.
But in the mountains, you have to be careful not to get buried by an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to outrun a required number of opponents (the normal thing in a classic race), then you try to gain time (classic timed duel) and then you are faced with a duel against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this, the police sometimes appear, which only makes things more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button just at the right time.
It's not complicated.
Surprisingly, however, there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you might expect (specifically there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that makes the game more interesting.
The driving pattern follows the footprints of the previous episodes.
That means that today it is not a big deal, but you can't say it's bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race designed with plenty of action suits this style of driving quite well, although we may find something better among the competing games.
So far, all is in order.
But problems arise after a while.
Unlike the correctness of driving models, the same is no longer true of collisions.
Games like this one can't be expected to recreate complicated warping and collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can't predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
Typically, when you overtake a car too tightly or drive it through normal traffic, there are only slight friction, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrollable pirouettes.
Or even end up totally destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no major problems arise, but it can make you feel bad.
The resets are programmed in such a way that when you suffer an accident or go off the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, only five resets are available in each race.
If you consume all of them, you have to start the race from the beginning.
So it's just a help in case something goes wrong, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes, even resetting doesn't help, it just helps to memorize the given stage.
A major disadvantage of the game is that the same events are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself in a "civilian" vehicle somewhere always with the same configuration, even if you are first, fifth or arrive five minutes early or late.
This is especially irritating in situations, when you see two cars coming together in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you have to turn or brake.
It doesn't matter when you arrive, because it's programmed so that the surprise will always happen right under your nose.
The opponents have one more advantage.
Throughout the game, you'll come to places where, regardless of the timing, you'll always be outmatched by the same opponent in the same place.
And it happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must get there before you, no matter the cost.
When it's in front of you, it makes it hard to see cars coming in front of you, so you can start to eat the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so obvious that you're sure to be disappointed right away.
And it's a shame, because even though the travel model is simple, the game is fun and action packed, so it's often not possible to follow in detail what's happening or where.
And it really doesn't matter, whether the credit goes to the idea with 50 exclusive tracks or the qualifying in the race so it doesn't fit the boredom, or whatever.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to be careful at the gas stations on the side of the road, because that's where you have to change cars, although in most cases you'll be fine with what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example, on mountain roads with curves.
In addition to the main storyline, there is also a parallel challenge, which is to say, there are races in specific places that you will know from the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which is useful for both challenges and stories.
When the driver reaches the top level, several possibilities open up, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog function is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and makes other community functions available.
One of the hardest elements to understand is how the last race in history is done.
You drive to the subway tunnel (pass), where you start running through the dark tracks (pass).
The speedometer puts you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and suddenly the subway convoy comes behind you and takes you just ahead.
In the newsroom we will probably have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
It is a pity that in the most tense moments the quality of the image is reduced and sometimes seriously.
This is particularly true in accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to appeal to the majority of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the "each one his father and his mother" category, but one can assume that no one would buy the game just for its music.
The final feel of Need for Speed: The Run is thus quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely stupid mistakes, we would have trouble claiming The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
It feels like the game isn't over.
The fun is guaranteed, but prepare yourselves because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the force of airport searchlights.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for being negative and Eurosceptic.
'The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between the individual institutions'
"I didn't expect a war to be waged without a quarter".
"It will take five or six years before the situation has stabilized a little, calmed down and the new players have got used to their new roles", began the Czech Ambassador to the EU Milena Vicenová with conviction at her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
How could one not take seriously his slogan 'clear and open about Europe', which he said at the beginning of his lecture when he described each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as would be the envy of many lecturers at the University of Carolina Law School?
Vicenová also reflected on the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first criticism is that he is a foolish, grey official, capable of taking on any role, but I must say that he has left everyone bewildered, because he takes on his roles perfectly".
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 countries, how to communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go".
The new position of Foreign and Security Policy representative is explained by the question: 'Who is this EU? What number can I call?'
No one wants to ban us from Olomouc cheese
The European Council has been, is and will continue to be the agenda for the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, solved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently busy.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good uproar", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget must be approved, because the current economic situation is much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive the most support and which countries the least?
The Ambassador also recalled her main motto, with which she arrived in Europe: 'About Europe with clarity'.
"The truth is, I don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, or slang that people don't understand".
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented - curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that nobody is going to ban us from Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to make more use of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of speed awaits us
The Czech people have a reputation for being Eurosceptic and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones, according to the ambassador.
He also regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame lies with a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, a Frenchman next to me says, 'What, you guys from the Visegrad Group are already together?'
The EU is facing new and very tough budgetary policy rules for the Member States in the future, she said.
It is perceived as something very real of the two-speed concept, if not more so, in Europe, rather than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone".
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure".
"It was said for the first time that only countries that want to cooperate and those that don't, stay out".
'These procedures will be increasingly used and will reinforce the two-speed Europe,' she hopes.
He also stressed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in implementing the principle that all issues affecting the EU as a whole should be discussed between Member States, not just between eurozone members.
Brand story:
Innovative IBM enters its second century of existence
If someone were to look for a term that would very accurately define IBM's strategy, the most approximate would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet has already passed a hundred years since its foundation.
The foundation for this long-term character was laid by the firm's first head, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He coined the slogan that many of the world's problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
Its slogan "Think!" became its hallmark, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully constructed company culture.
"For us, IBM means long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it stayed true to its core principles, but not afraid of the changes around it.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century", said the company's current director, Samuel J. Palmisano, during his anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the entrepreneur of Baťa in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American operators to enjoy paid holidays, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and salespeople.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the customer relationship.
From the very beginning the company was able to discover talent (as one of the first companies in the world to eliminate any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, which will replace Palmisano next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has worked for IBM for 30 years, where she was head of sales, marketing and strategy.
Over the past few years IBM has been involved in so-called virtual meetings, online brainstorming, from which endless future strategies and innovations have emerged.
Not surprisingly, ideas abound, since the firm employs nearly half a million people.
A reputable institution
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM has been more of an institution than a technology company", says economist Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor at Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users", says George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between going into business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or the "Big Green" - as it is known in the US familiarly because of its logo, has in the last hundred years become one of the biggest companies in the world.
It is arguably the most versatile technology company (it develops both hardware and software, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the most patents of any U.S. technology company and five of its employees have received Nobel prizes.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes, and floppy disks.
IBM will turn over $220 billion this year, making it the second-largest technology company by market capitalization (the first being Apple), after Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the Future
Not all products and innovations just satisfy the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on moving forward, you cannot be emotionally anchored in the past", admitted Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and equally, if they don't work, it abandons them).
And that's the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which basically stands and falls always exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly engaged in services, of which approximately one fifth is software and another fifth is equipment.
However, even in 1990 equipment represented more than half of the supplier's share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets worth a total of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM acts on the premise of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 1929 increased investment.
It seems that so far IBM has managed to weather the crisis.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of 2008 has risen by 120%, the net profit of the company has continued to rise.
IBM's motto is change everything but its value.
So it is to be hoped that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will hold out.
The history of IBM: from the cheese cutter to space flight
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted in 1924 - originally a trademark used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The foundation for IBM came from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous "ficher clock", which allowed control of the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the company's management.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name implies, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson ran the company, revenue doubled to $9 million and the company began its great expansion across the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after almost forty years in the chief's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his direction, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM personnel and computers helped NASA guide spaceflights (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the standard of computers at the time, came to market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which in turn acquired the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began offering a full range of high value-added consulting and services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the past three years is the concept of a Smarter Planet, that is, "a smarter planet".
It aims to make more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned or conditions improved, for example in transport and city management.
For the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform that enables retailers to manage the entire retail cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
In 1932 the branch was opened in what was then Czechoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe to have such a branch.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague, and there's also a world-renowned research team here that works with speech recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it is over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina still had the hope that Josef would wake up from his pink sleep and return home.
However, he will not wait any longer and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but not as my partner", Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová took Bartošové into her home for the summer, she could not imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned herself, apparently accepting her husband's relationship and even saying goodbye to him for good.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not be waiting for him at home with open arms.
He's the biological father of my children, and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will kick him out".
"But I would live here no longer as my dear old man who made a mistake, but as a man with whom I have certain ties", Rychtářová said, adding that she had already broken away from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef so far doesn't mind that his wife has locked the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision".
"I'll be with Iveta and no change is possible".
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect that".
"The company is still in business, I do housework, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping".
"Darina and I talk normally, only we don't share a bed", Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not object.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility", concludes Josef.
The worst vices of women: do they also apply to you?
If you ask men who are able to name some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourselves in the following lines, where certain female vices are mentioned that can make men's blood boil?
Going shopping
You blame your orange half for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one little thing a week?
Do you like to shop often at the sale?
So in your case, you could say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women find that they should appease their shopping cravings, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to wander through clothing stores, look for tight-fitting garments, and then try them all on in the fitting room (ideally in all different colors)?
While for most women shopping is a pastime, for men it can be practically hell.
Just remember how many times you've told your partner to wait for you outside the door.
The Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least ten pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Do these phrases sound familiar?
What's that?
So she's one of those women obsessed with her looks.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain about their physical appearance all the time.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more frequent the complaints, the more annoying the women become.
Order and cleanliness first
It's like an infinite vortex.
Clean windows, vacuum, wipe the floor, dust, scrub the bathtub, and all that at least twice a week.
Do you reproach your spouse for stepping on your clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for dirtying a freshly cleaned sink, and a shelf with glass doors that you have struggled to clean?
If you suffer from this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be overblown and that order and cleanliness surely should not take priority in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten their relationships and family well-being.
Making unpleasant comments
"Worn underwear is left with the dirty laundry".
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too?"
"Wet rags are not left on the floor!"
If you make these mistakes more than once a day, you can get your partner out of his box.
You don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, on the other hand, would not make so many comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women also do slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, which is why they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us occasionally misses a small, harmless gossip.
With the hand on the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are uncontrolled gossipy women who love to gossip and do so often, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female work team.
Jagr and Voráček helped Philadelphia with their assists.
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr participated Monday in the NHL game with two assists that brought the win over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and puts the Czech players back in the lead of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's play, and took a step further and was declared the best player of the match.
He was awarded two assists in the match and also Jágr's teammate, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr told overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"I told him before the game I'd triple".
"I was introducing him".
"Sometimes they look like ambushes", explained Jágr, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first trallaco.
A short time later the second intervention of the team also had a Czech trace.
Voráček grabbed the puck from behind the Hurricanes' goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first half, a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was ejected, but from the beginning of the second half the Flyers were already dominating.
Specifically for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through the quarter of Wayne Simmonds' goal.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player on the court, but he's definitely among the top three", Jágr told his central.
"I never thought I'd end up playing with a sportsman like him".
"I'm very pleased with it".
"I want to play for him".
All these years in the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results", adds Jágr.
Carolina even turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then again Dwyer's, from the penalty spot, until he was put to a goal away.
Matt Read didn't allow any more complications, although they were outnumbered two to one.
"Pronger had a good performance on our field".
"He cleared the disc, I picked up speed and Read went to the far side".
"I tried to hit the puck and I'm happy because I did it", Voráček described the last goal of the match as he lived it.
With their win, Philadelphia has moved into first place in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an upper body injury.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also by a two-goal margin, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec missed one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the back row, and play the game with only five defenders.
"That is bad".
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novices".
"Well, but there is nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it", said Jacques Martin.
"So much rotation of players turned against us, we couldn't resist".
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the puck out of our court".
"And so we left gaps", explained one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty shutouts for Winnipeg in the 5-2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals were scored by five players, ending a losing streak that had already lasted five games.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorised state-owned travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in most cases only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists were therefore going on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime leaned westward and the travel of Czech tourists was then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even in socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West in those days, but one had to stand in line with a sleeping bag and stay that way all night, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West was not granted to "politically unreliable people", who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired.
The way in which the Czechs travel has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 we were not going to spend our holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries all over the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware, that the destination of choice, Croatia, was not free to travel to until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia.
The early 1990s saw the introduction of visa-free travel to neighbouring Western European countries, which led to a huge surge in short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not seem tired of excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, groups of Czechs slept in tents in parks, since our income at the time did not allow us to afford a hotel or boarding house.
A typical characteristic of Czechs at that time was to take food with them (cans, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our living standards were rising and so were average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in demand for travel.
With the increase in demand for travel, agencies began, from 1997 onwards, to regularly prepare travel using charter flights, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts on passenger volume.
By the late 1990s, the Czechs were traveling visa-free to almost all developed countries except the United States, which made our travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism occurred back in 2000, when the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, thanks to huge demand, and it was to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries have been operating every year.
The exotic countries are currently visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in the year 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States removed visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs for the first time in their history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history spent more than 15 thousand CZK per capita on foreign travel, including the costs of the place of stay.
Ordinary General Assembly convened to elect the president, which could end up deadlocked again.
For almost five months now Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the next Extraordinary General Assembly will be convened in Nymburk on Thursday.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you cannot even vote to choose between the three candidates.
The candidates to preside over the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June, not without first calling his colleagues together to find a strong person who could handle football in the future.
However, after the Hašek era ended, a controversy broke out between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prague district of Smíchov, because talks had been blocked and not only as to the method of election.
No consensus was reached even as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment on, and because of this single point, a partial agreement was reached, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which full representation is not possible.
However, the disputes over the electoral code remain open.
The Executive Committee, which at its ordinary and extraordinary meetings did not resolve anything, could not shed any more light on the situation.
Opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how do we proceed in the third round to avoid a stalemate?
"The dispute is about whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model", says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who, from the association's leadership, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy.
The Moravian Region is willing to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely negate the concept of a bicameral system", this is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and to vote according to the applicable statutes.
The Commission is also aware of the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the application of the rules on the protection of the financial interests of the Union.
"I'd like to see the vote as strictly as possible in accordance with the bylaws".
"So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives like in the last General Assembly", says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
He said the new president would be decided at Nymburk and he hoped that the candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"All the passions will be appeased by today's match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will be the main focus again, and so we will cooperate more easily", says the Jablonice representative, who has more experience in football management than any other candidate, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope an agreement can be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated".
"It's not a matter of bohemian-Moravian conflict, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience".
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly".
"Anyway, I hope common sense prevails", said Rajchl.
There's not much time left for all parties to come to an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, which was to take Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl to Podgorica, did not leave this morning because of technical problems in Prague, and an alternative was to be found to transport some of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which, according to them, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to bring the divided parties into the most powerful sports organization in the country so that an agreement can be reached.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) which will try to give a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight for the presidency, because he can't find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen players, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary general assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not even stand as a candidate for such a relevant post.
"If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and not run for office".
"But to this day no such person has been found", Paclík told Czech News Agency (ČTK).
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the election, who opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the position of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would come.
In that capacity, I would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too involved in football events.
"I've already spoken to some people I might consider".
"I was crazy to hear some say that at this moment they don't even want to identify with Czech football".
"I would like to change that view", he adds.
What is supposedly most upsetting Paclík at the moment is Pelta's relationship with the President of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In the event I win, the status quo will remain and nothing in football will change".
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will get even less profit", Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a phone tapping during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta came out unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory could bring to football".
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us", said Paclík, who also takes a certain caution with his earlier statement that "he would sell Club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president".
In the event of winning the election on Thursday, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
The same view is held by the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow".
"He's very capable".
"I could imagine him, for example, as head of representation".
"but not as a manager of an association".
"I don't stick my nose where I feel I can't", added Paclík, who in September drew a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Arbitration Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He has been managing private companies since last summer and is also the director of Pilsen, which won the first division title in May with his support.
"I have the strength to change some things in the football field and contribute to its safe practice".
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations", Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards Sparta president Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it would exert pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to sport from lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key issues the new president should be concerned with".
"If they raise taxes on gambling, as the political parties are advertising, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going", he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the FAČR President must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal".
"But I don't see any point in hypocritically giving my shares in the Pilsen Club to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half", Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end the election deadlock.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FAČR had new statutes that would serve definitively to resolve, in the future, the controversies regarding the electoral regulation.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-electoral conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to take part at the last minute in the last general meeting, so this two-month postponement could be good for him to defend and present, in a wider context, his ideas on football management.
"People at all levels have been involved in football for a long time and look forward to meeting the new President on Thursday".
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association", thinks the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and on the Association's executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria of the time of Ivan Hašek is behind the current problems with the elections.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly the statutes were approved which were not as perfect as everyone thought".
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president already since September", Pelta warned.
It was precisely the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association that was used as a lure to win over the delegates.
"If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am prepared to respond in case this fails".
"It's a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist", says Pelta.
Plus, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
I had already said in the past that I was working with Henry Rajchl, whom I respect for his law degree, knowing that his opponent would also be my first vice-president.
He hadn't attacked Thomas Paclík in a long time who, unlike Pelta, didn't leave a puppet with a head.
"He's been in the football world for over a year, and he's already had some successes".
"Their attacks were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign".
"That is why many of them doubt their true character", he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is, he says, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the highest.
This last one should be a football promotional showcase.
"I would also try to sort out all the scandals that have arisen because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal".
"Immediately after that I would get involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football", the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as football president would not involve any personal modification of the staff.
"I should first know the tasks of each employee", he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, there is understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios predicted before the next general assembly, he believes the delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly get through it.
"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader", still two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FAČR would start working eagerly.
If the current vice-president, Jindrich Rajchl, is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the fourth general assembly, many people will surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that if he gets elected, he'll work hard.
It wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
It also commits to resolving the Bohemians case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work started by the previous president Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I would like to devote myself entirely to football".
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, through professional football and the training of young high-performing footballers".
"I don't mean that I would do everything alone", Rajchl said in an interview with ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the responsibilities of the executive committee so that each member can devote himself to a specific area".
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with great momentum".
"Many people probably won't like this, because it will mean starting to work really hard and not just criticizing the work of others", he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he is said to have considered the possibility of not running again as a candidate.
"Everybody knows, I work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will hinder me and hinder me at every step", she explained the reasons for her indecision.
"Many people have told me not to give up, because then others would give up too".
"It's about having faith not to just give up", he said.
It is said that it also motivates him to continue the work he has already started with Hašek.
"During those two years, a great deal of work was done that I don't want to lose now".
"There are processes that have been started and will have their effect within a couple of years and I would not like anyone to stop them", he announced, concerned that if they elected the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could return to what it was before Hašek's time.
"I believe in order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him are above all those people who would take care of football so that it was only a privilege for a select few".
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not for being a fan".
"I try to be objective".
"I want to make football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel good and not just the chosen ones", Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president is a bohemian.
"Although some people try to claim otherwise, I intend to do my utmost for Moravia".
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second division into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first division".
"It would not be the current situation where we have only three Moravian teams, which is a problem for young Moravian players", Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential race, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel I have strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice-president and who knows that there are clear successes behind me", said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of crowns from unfavourable contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating the lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his part of the blame for the federation's disunity.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football", he regards his other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year".
"If elected, he will probably continue what Ivan Hašek has already started and will not significantly change the staffing of the committees".
"I don't want to use that to my advantage", he assesses his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible vantage point, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Visitors to Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip for the past year and a half, there was one thing she couldn't miss in her luggage: a swimsuit.
Lying on her back over the water, she looked up at the artistic dome above, swam toward the marble angels, who were waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, he took notes in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the covered pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete buildings" in Taunus.
He made his "journey through the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" through 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
He wants nothing to do with sports, says Meder, only water is different.
He is only annoyed that bathers have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can breathe the fascinating scent of fir forests or hear the joyful song of birds in the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly", says this Viennese.
"I started collecting beautiful pools".
The water surface doubles the architecture.
The well-being factor in swimming pools is so great because all the senses are taken care of, according to Meder.
And if the builder makes an effort, indoor pools can be a real treat for the eyes: "Instead of floor, the bathrooms have a surface of water".
"On the one hand, it's transparent, on the other hand, it reflects the beauty of the entire building".
Everything is optically bent: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The small format photobook "Badefreuden" provides 190 pages of very interesting data on architecture and art history in historic oases of wellbeing, but, above all, it makes you want to jump into the blue.
Meder, a pool collector, discovers the highlights of her research in Hungary.
Alongside the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, there are nitrate waters in a unique karst cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths, whose pools are alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city is looking at the Zurich rooftop pool, you can look out over the snow-covered Arlberb from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: the water cathedral in Ötztal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
Steam rises from three open springs in winter, while the Ötztal mountains rise into the sky in the background.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, was not bothered by the chlorine smell in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people think they have reached a toilet.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose lye sticks to the skin when you enter the pool, a delight of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for beautiful places for bathing, when she wanted to visit open pools and sunbaths in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she came across a blocked terrain.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw weeds growing among the tiles.
The decay was countered by a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three phases of construction behind them; not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements from the time of their construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall in Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its painstaking modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of pool collector Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural to the Black Forest.
"It's very rewarding to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit", says Meder.
In a palace like this, the immersion in the thermal pool is apparently of little importance.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank looks at the commodities business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank relinquish its business in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a task force to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
The Commission has
For citizens, the matter is clear: according to one survey, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of those surveyed claim that Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions should withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity markets drives prices up, and banks bear responsibility for the world's hunger problem.
The consumer advocate's campaign is specifically aimed at Josef Ackermann, the head of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, commodity betting was intended to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that the players have decoupled from supply and demand, and are profiting from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently than US competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "deserves to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international task force is reviewing the claims in the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, at which time the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank's board, along with a recommendation on how to handle the matter.
The bank's management will report on the consequences at the end of January.
The final result could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even its complete abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The bets on rising food prices show in a particularly dramatic way how ruthless banks are currently harming public welfare".
Ackermann is the biggest bank lobbyist, especially on bonds.
"Deutsche Bank should cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts money into food price bets", Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann is about starving people or Deutsche Bank fame".
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first glance, but it's clear that the head of the consortium wants to provide a perfect image a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board will make a change to the board of directors that was not planned.
By abandoning the controversial land speculation, he can improve his image.
And he needs to care little about potential losses, which his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices are bet.
Many of the bank's customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such business: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments that make money from agricultural speculation.
Forty-three percent would advise against such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institution.
The 21st house in Vienna
The flag moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski, who is the author of the book
An architectural story with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion at the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, was left empty and fell apart.
Now it's reopening as an exhibition house.
The passionate postwar modern architecture, the clear forms, the glass halls, the bold curves and the new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its lightweight, floating steel and glass construction.
The building is considered to be a contemporary architectural landmark.
It made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was erected after the Universal Exhibition in the Schweizer Garten next to the South Vienna station, was refurbished in 1962 and inside was opened a 20th-century museum, it was called the "house 20".
The building was adequate but lacked the space and technology to make a museum; no wall to hang art, no good atmosphere.
Despite this it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been vacant since 2001 and is decaying.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz has refurbished the pavilion, now calling it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Tuesday afternoon the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, was opened with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery since 2007, has made a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, an artistic ice skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms at the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the eponymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafe and a bookstore and also an office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he sensibly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded it and was awarded the competition, but also because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "an energy devourer", Krischanitz said.
The windows of the glass façade were changed, an insulating glass reinforced with glass fibre was installed and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel lowered between the house and the street provides illumination, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in old mahogany tones and protected against rust.
And the movie theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the Monuments Office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked by the Office of Monuments Protection", says Krischanitz, warning of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The pavilion "which came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "accidental appearance in the history of the city".
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that is why I wanted to "awaken the right awareness".
In this case, house 21 is not in the wrong place, it is a case of urban luck.
And perhaps another stroke of luck will come: House 21 could receive a boost from another Krischanitz construction, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and is reportedly negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package worth millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train failures in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a news report.
The newspaper Bild reported, citing an internal crisis plan of the group, that investments were planned up to 2005 totalling around EUR 300 million.
This requires better availability of vehicles and the rail network even in extreme weather.
Among other things, plans are being made to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 to remove snow from the tracks and platforms.
The aim is to clear snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 per cent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, chairman of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train failures and delays this winter as well after a summit with government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, for example because it ran out of reserves in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting years for authorization from the Federal Railroad Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered a break in an axle at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in fines in the US.
After the uproar over President Josef Ackerman, a new problem appears in the US, Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutsche Bank, its past in the US buys the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute, 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a settlement, to end the strife due to the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage bonds.
The NCUA, the regulator of financial markets, rebukes many large banks for inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have downplayed the risks.
Such bonds lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clear up the matter without the parties having to go to court", said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank admits no fault with the settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect customer investments.
The NCUA is trying to reinstate the millions of losses it caused.
The agreements currently concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also held other large banks to account and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of doubtful mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing loans.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, it led to the downfall of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the American investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results came a few years ago, there is a difficult wind blowing for US banks.
Investors and the inspection have filed countless lawsuits to receive compensation or punish wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the most lawsuits.
It rebukes the 18 major international banks that the two US state-owned mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business to the tune of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a claim from the FHFA, it is dealing with transactions worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to answer for "substantial losses", without giving an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, is heavily invested in the information technology company IBM.
Since March, he has acquired more than ten billion dollars worth of stock.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always said he will not invest in computer companies or information technology because the long-term development forecasts of the companies are negative.
But he's read IBM's business report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He should have understood long before that IBM mainly provides services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive of Information Technology should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett recently revealed on the CNBC business news channel that he has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has thereby risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM hadn't heard about the compromise until now.
He praised the management for taking care of ordinary profits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job", Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long established lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centres.
The 100-year-old IT pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful equipment for businesses.
Buffett has avoided tech companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies that he understood the business.
Instead, Buffett took the opportunity on a freight train, at a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 of its own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it into one of the world's most valuable companies.
Yet, their lifestyle is humble.
That's why he's an idol to countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has earned him the nickname "Oracles of Omaha".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's stock on the stock market went up one percent.
"The blue giant", as IBM is known, has a market value of more than $220 billion and ranks, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world's most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat comes true
Following the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media have cast doubt on the German rule of law.
A newspaper reports a "bloody ideology" is being revived.
The murders of eight small businessmen between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
In Turkey and among the German population of Turkish origin, this news has caused fear and concern.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that had long been thought dead is returning. Since the firebombings in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there have been no further episodes of extreme right-wing violence against Turks.
However, there has never been any question that xenophobia exists in Germany.
The ultra-right network uncovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were far from predictable.
"Is bloody ideology reviving?" is the headline of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The newspaper "Sabah" highlights on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office for the Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, remembering the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate over the weekend.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had reflected on the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged in cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information reached some Turkish media like a slap: "German gift for the 50th anniversary", says the title of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German broadcaster "Hürriyet" does not insist on tracing this mental connection either.
"It's starting to smell bad", says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He points out that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Internet forums of Turkish-Germans, the police's behavior and subsequent success in the searches is discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities did not look for suspects in the far-right circle much earlier.
Some are less rhetorical about drastic measures: "From now on, it's all over, immigrants have only self-defense and weapons".
"This will be the best self-protection".
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network", writes "Selen".
This means that if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen will be solved in 90 years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been etched into German and Turkish memories.
No other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a real threat and to the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the group feeling on the Turkish side.
Not repeating the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press was then mainly criticized for the deficiency of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack, Solingen sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the Cologne funeral.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated by the amount of his taxes.
The current information in the Turkish media once again shows the depth of distrust many Germans of Turkish origin have since shown for the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort to provide a broad explanation and reassessment of far-right terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The bank of the Zurich lake scandal
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has slipped from one crisis to the next since then.
Now it's run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought of that.
After his spectacular departure from the Federal Bank summit, in July it was announced that in 2013 he would start a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly rejoicing, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity and dropping kind remarks about his future colleagues.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization".
"I am delighted to be collaborating with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
By September it was clear that everything would be totally different.
A financial USB operator in London bypassed all bank security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, the CEO of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The chairman of the USB board of directors was then considered equally touched, and everyone asked: When is Axel Weber coming?
It became known that Weber will be advising the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman of the board in May, not early 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and a consultant and has had a period of adaptation which is certainly necessary.
Suddenly, he is responsible for the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that it deserves the title of "Europe's biggest scandal bank" for a long time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has been slipping from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis started.
USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid, but also manly Swiss asset manager, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a big number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's big banks.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker who later taught banking in Zurich for many years, explains: "To my students, I have always described the USB as a model of a good bank".
"From the current point of view, one wonders, 'How could I be wrong?'
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007, it came out that something went very wrong with the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, surprisingly resigned.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund went into a loss-making recession with risky bonds and had to write off billions.
To finance this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
To this end, he found investors, naturally some of whom had looked down on him until recently: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare a loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors, in 2006 on the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its misplaced investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problem securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, by which it became co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was said how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the sum of UBS' balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than the Swiss economic results (see chart).
"We cannot rescue UBS again", said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated to a tax dispute with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly evaded taxes with the bank's help.
It also approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with a payment of compensation.
UBS has more or less confessed to aiding tax evasion.
At the same time, he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for wealthy customers: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank's secrecy is not the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Management Board and the Chairman of the Administrative Board.
And the exodus of client funds.
In a few months, the bank thus lost credibility in its two core sectors: investment banking through misguided speculation and asset management through aid to tax evasion.
And just when it was getting a little quieter again, just when it was thought that UBS was getting it back, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it turns out, apparently, this still doesn't work well with risk management in investment banking.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little", says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it does not master risk controls".
The idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers have long been presenting themselves, was thus born: to be the guardians of the greatest assets in the world: no risk is too great, but the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
UBS' Zurich headquarters doesn't fit the cliché of a solid Swiss private bank, it's just a little older.
It's a classic situation.
The bank has its head office on Bahnhofstraße in Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are ostentatious, the rents are among the highest in Europe.
Here you find jewelry shops like Tiffany's among traditional Swiss businesses like the Sprüngli confectionery.
The Swiss banks have been here for years: from the national bank, through the Credit Suisse palace, to the elite private banks like Julius Bär.
You enter the UBS reception hall through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are clad in marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the bank logo is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or have betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
UBS has become too big, he says, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the manners of the Anglo-Saxons".
In fact, UBS changed Anglo investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then disaster came, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"That Wednesday the coalition government of the small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do you figure that?
You talk to the Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges which, because of the merger, was too big for little Switzerland, and it continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two distinct precursor banks of UBS: a rich but sleeping bank with the asset management center in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks arrived in a timely fashion with a lot of money, with which they could make a big financial bike roll.
There are two names associated with this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team", says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, the modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make his way from apprenticeship at the bank to the top".
Ospel finally trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake: "He thought his models were a reality", says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case".
Tragic, perhaps.
It's clear: the folly came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the board meetings, where Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same slogan:
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They topped the "League Tables", the rankings that then documented the success of banks.
UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps worked out for him.
In foreign exchange and stock trading it was at the top.
However, the advisers in charge of the companies highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the language of "fixed income banking", there is a huge compensation for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Eager for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their venture funds created in American high-risk investments.
It became a powerful machine for securitizing American mortgages and then selling them, keeping certain risks to itself.
And also, like other banks, it looked down for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American housing market was on fire, UBS bought there", said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager had to leave because the attempt to organize turned out to be more complicated than they expected.
The positions at UBS became projectile seats and are insecure to this day.
Nowadays, whoever runs a big bank has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a banking expert, has an idea, to end investment banking, concentrate on asset management, go back to his Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking must be greatly reduced, it is clear at present.
The following Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only thought of as a temporary solution, as the bank the bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has taken over: He must permanently run UBS's business, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its mid-90s state.
It eliminates 3,500 jobs.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it? - Who is it?
What do you want to make money off of?
These are the questions Axel Weber is probably asking himself right now.
So far he's just saying he'll first look for a place with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock market
The looming recession in Europe has scared American investors earlier in the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remain in force.
The slowdown in industrial production on the continent is stifling hopes of stabilizing a crisis caused by debt.
General relief may not be imposed on changes of government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has been half full, not half empty, but now the problems are coming back to the forefront, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are listed in the sales list.
The Dow Jones stock index closed down 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.
In the session, the market barometer ranges from 12.027 to 12.170 points.
The S&P 500 index closed at 1.251 points, down one percent.
The technology stock market Nasdaq lost 0.8 percent and slipped 2.657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax index is falling 1.2 percent to 5,985 points.
The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its output and is at the end of its boom.
Enterprises produced two percent less in September than the previous month, as reported by Eurostat's statistics office.
This created skepticism among American investors: "We are not an island, if not dependent", said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot get out of recession so quickly, and there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this caution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview for CNBC.
It is therefore too early in its view to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, he throws away a decade-old principle and enters the American tech sector.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the traditional consortium's stock price and makes it price against the market trend at first just a percentage higher.

Smart greases are spreading in cities
In many places, the greyhounds are considered "problem birds".
Some like them, others want to get rid of them quickly, the greasy ones have been part of the city's image for years, but in many municipalities there are complaints from neighbors about the filth and noise of the animals.
Although no means has emerged against the "problem birds" so far.
The Greys are no longer leaving the cities, experts say at the first Greys symposium in Leer, East Frisia.
There specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in the cities.
Environmentalists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected fats from the countryside; chemical applications in agriculture are visibly destroying traditional living spaces.
Hunting, building, and felling trees make life difficult for the birds.
The fat ones are protected.
There are large colonies with over 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to mass kill the district's fat people made negative headlines.
Critics have called the hunting of animals by bird traps and the killing with sticks especially brutal.
"Throwing them out and driving them away in the normal way is not going to get anything done", said Werner Klöver, a town planner and landscape designer in Leer.
Shooting nests with water or knocking down trees are often unintended consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals drift, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere".
Driving them away is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them".
Without the surroundings, the problem in cities is not solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of driving animals out of sensitive residential areas and bait them to re-settle elsewhere is possible.
"Information panels instead of chainsaws" Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens advocates against treating animals differently: "The best thing is that we can stand a spike in the face with serenity".
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger Fratch Education Circuit in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs inform about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is being accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on criticism of bird noise: "They are all forms of communication, they have a lot to say".
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the fat ones not only harness resources to access chunks of schist, but they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at Cambridge University tested the intelligence of birds on four levels.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone that had to fall onto the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning greasers had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with their beak.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they caught the bucket in the tube's drawer.
Three of the four fat guys got it on the first try.
Portugal at the Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have secured their final play-off tickets for the Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Led by triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after a 0-0 draw in the first leg, made five consecutive appearances in the European Championship.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs second leg with outsider Montenegro, after they left things clear in the first leg (2-0).
Croatia did not let them score in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) both shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the play-offs of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
At the Stadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started off perfectly.
Ronaldo executed a direct free kick from over 30 yards to take the lead in points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her skills to score from a distance and scored 2-0 from 25 metres.
The Bosnians, who did not show up in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player, leader of English side Manchester City, delivered a head kick to the club, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek hit for the Czech Republic
Next up, collegiate Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the penati area of Bosnia, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark pitched a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European runner-up cleared it all with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt in the 81st minute with a goal from Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion qualifies for the Euro for the fifth time in a row.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) also got lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the opening phase.
In the last minute, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided a possible goal in Tomas Sivok's own goal with a reflex (9).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the front row lap, right in the goal of Cech.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the long-range of the world-famous goalkeeper, the forward of FC Seoul again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end decided the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey squandered the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks are no closer to a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink would have to leave his seat on the bench of the 2002 World Cup, the Croats celebrated their fourth appearance in the Euro Cup final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
In the seventh minute, with a long-range kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post.
After the second reaction, Croatia took more and more control.
After the break, Croatia did not let any goal be scored.
Alongside Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute gave way to Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the Bundesliga legionnaires in practice.
Trapattoni is going to the European Cup
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who triumphed 4-0 in the first leg prepared for a preliminary decision, took the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the invited team.
Ireland pushed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy got his first big break.
From the first moment, the Estonian defense avoided possible advantage goals.
But in the 32nd minute, he got ahead of him.
After a defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, getting it 1-0.

Slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of World War I, "begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one's soul drop to its feet.
Here are some tips for action: Gently start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
You will get to know these people very well in Mr Englund's novel-telling, and this dramatis personae will function as your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, like one of your men and women, you are confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he describes, correctly, as "a work of anti-history".
It contains some notable names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, fancy journalists, or discussions of tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened". It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods".
"The beauty and pain of battle combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from standard history books.
It's also a corrective to the notion that World War I was just the disastrous trench war on the Western Front.
"The Beauty and the Sorrow of Battle" moves expertly through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book are hit by beehives; you spend Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War floods these people's lives like a natural disaster, a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's home with your children, do you stay or run?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one understands what's going on, or even why this war has to be fought.
"Lack of facts", notes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjecture, assumption, hope, fear, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"The Beauty and the Sorrow of Battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the High Seas Fleet.
Her stories have been obtained in large part from memoirs, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or moving, but they are most alive in Mr. Englund's accumulation of small moments, missing details.
Many of these are about deprivation and coping with what you have.
She tells the story of a German schoolgirl: "Succeed them, everywhere substitutes".
"Coffee slip, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons, and a few other things".
He keeps talking about the surrogate food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice pressed in ram's fat (and topped with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from dried potato roots and peels; shoes with wooden soles".
There, he notes, "are 837 permitted meat substitutes in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American acknowledges his own drive for savagery and says of war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are made for and not to sit on armchairs with a cigar and a whiskey, the evening paper or a best seller, and pretend that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starchy, stuffy chest".
A British soldier, on the other hand, realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
"Once you resign yourself to the thought of self-sacrifice, you would like to think it could happen in front of an audience", he writes.
Rather, it is horribly like "a condemned man being strangled in secret".
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new kinds of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition", writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories".
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: The eloquent, ideologically convinced mass murderer in well-made clothes who carries out his butchery while sitting behind a desk".
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both undignified and heroic behavior.
Mr Englund talks about soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and smear on their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital", he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it on their eyes, often resulting in lifelong blindness".
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr Englund's prose, agile but not extravagant, is perfectly suited to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, it reflects the way the war "unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the Modern Memory by Paul Fussell, or novels like No Novel on the Front by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive stories.
Mr Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
Your book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a work of nonfiction.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he came from his book, ripped that page of dramatis personae from your fingers, and burned it with a match.
After a previous misstep, a planned assault at the minute.
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
Monday-Tuesday night was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be emptier.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underscoring how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks, such as pepper spraying on protesters, violating departmental rules and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "occupants" could not be repeated.
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared by watching how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye on Zuccotti.
Agents increased so-called riot training - counterterrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing large numbers of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park came at the "last minute", said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"The few cops I know who were called for this, they weren't told it was to enter Zuccotti Park", said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The only people who knew they were going into Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department".
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district - dozens of mobile officers who routinely flooded high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, such as those who commute daily to work, had been commuting to and from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do it when there were fewer people in the park", he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with headlights and speakers congregated at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages that resounded from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply packed their things and left.
No shops were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if any arrests were needed at the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the police department, said it was for their safety.
But many journalists said that they were tried to prevent them from seeing the police enter the park, and that they had been treated harshly by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved westward through the dense tangle of protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and paper and plastic garbage bags crammed with clothing, cleaning department teams followed, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, images of which appeared on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took up positions near the camp's kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some of them made a barrier, and the police came in to methodically arrest them.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp locked each other's arms.
And two people were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said that about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "altering public order and resisting authority", he said.
The highest ranking officer at the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the department head, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not running the operations", Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the east side of Broadway between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to go in.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, and on Pine Street, one block south.
From those positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of officers, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the north perimeter.
Some of the night's loudest action took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an officer and a protester were hospitalized.
The support workers union is suing the city for the layoffs.
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city's lowest paid lost their jobs on October 7, in a move that union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal last spring to allow the city access to a health assistance fund run by task forces to close its budget gap.
The city authorities have categorically denied that accusation.
At a City Hall hearing last month, education councilor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget passed in June.
A board member countered by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be fired.
Officials from Municipal District 37 said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants, and it features eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more attendees because they had been chronically undersubsidized.
It notes that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit".
P.S. District 36's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each enrollment per poor student in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by the language in a memorandum authorizing the firing of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" most often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school payroll to a work exchange, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired", the draft complaint says, "and not just in excess".
Mission accomplished, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed and for American involvement to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat from Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican from Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent from Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "bravery".
"This resolution is to honor the brave men of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country", Kerry said.
"It is a statement of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations".
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the Libyan debate has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting each other and the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and it never got to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress annoyed enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not angry enough to actually mow the lawn under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate might be ready to act.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee 'congratulates the people of Libya on their tremendous courage and extraordinary resilience in liberating themselves' and 'commends the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism'.
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers as did the June bill?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
Across the Capitol, the House is set to vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican of Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue to actually achieve a vote by the full House or Senate in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far been unsuccessful in getting their amendments through the assembly, but not for lack of trying.
Goodlatte's is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicates - the same bill is proposed in both the House and Senate - and others with slight variations from one another.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance of payments amendment in the House alone, and a handful of others that will "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially novice Republicans looking to refine their résumés - the opportunity to brag that they were the "authors" of the measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on a budget balance amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while Representative Jose E. Serrano (Democrat from New York), wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat from Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as is one banning flag burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
As enthusiastic as Members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren't much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but it was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beaten but not defeated", Giffords speaks in her first TV interview since the shooting.
Ten months after a gunman shot her at point-blank range at a constitutional rally in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) appeared on national television Monday night, sang to the Broadway tune "The Sun Will Rise Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In her appearance on ABC News' "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult journey back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and punctured the left side of his brain, and that went from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he came back to the House by surprise to cast his victorious vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords replied: "Rightly".
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special, which aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special was about Giffords' recovery from the Jan. 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar running across her forehead.
She can only hold one or two fingers up while her husband cheers her on.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
A nod of the head.
A frowning of the lips.
And then his first word, "What".
Within days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast", a request for a change in her breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Falling".
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said she doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said that he was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died", Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, and hard, and hard, and hard, and hard, and hard, and hard, and hard".
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated".
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've just been hit.
And you're gonna come out of this, and you're gonna get better and you're gonna come back stronger than ever".
Troops are more pitiful than respectful.
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At that moment, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines burst into their posts around him.
The tag crowd stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, also known as the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the troops' role differently.
"They showed them as some kind of orphan child", the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they did.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The sharply contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an often distant, sometimes adoring, American public.
He lavishes troops with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, service members say.
The public is acting more and more like they feel sorry for those uniforms.
"We are not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon be leaving for Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way some people can show their support is by putting us in the role of helpless souls".
The issue is a very sensitive one for military leaders, who don't want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that the troops who returned in the final years of the Vietnam War faced was far worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity are held quietly and privately among war veterans.
After their two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of dread because they had faced insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there was an "angry, violent veteran under the surface", said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had asked him subtly if he would be able to hold out under the pressure of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions", recalled Cancian, telling his children.
The military's unease stems, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II", said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of a service member's suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they've endured, the number of friends they've lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces growing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for their alleged passivity in the face of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
Private Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims to have been raped by a fellow soldier.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he ran into a colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer cans.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It sounded like an alarm", Lyman says.
However, the Texas native put her concerns aside.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"She's from Texas", he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts".
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached her from behind, threw her down and raped her, she alleges.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision in a landmark trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether the lawsuit they filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of soldiers' constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C., lawyer, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going after the army's top plank, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a top-down structure", he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says that since February, she's been contacted by nearly 400 more survivors, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of piling up all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, he's going to present several cases, if necessary, to keep the pressure on.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy - essentially, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for damages suffered by active duty personnel.
"The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs' military service", the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the '50s.
While women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have died, two thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time the military modernized, too, Burke says.
She's not alone in her fight, and three other lawsuits are underway, in addition to yours.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
Meanwhile, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on diagnoses of "personality disorder" assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service - a common occurrence, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefits claims for people who say they have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a number of amendments.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense's Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
However, the attacks are significantly underreported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, that figure is about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to trial - half that in the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe his seizures as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 different times to a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and her assailant's blood - from a cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which she was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read", says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to work - I found myself screaming from the living room".
"They put me in the psychiatric ward, and when I came out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That wasn't your judgment.
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was discharged from service on less-than-honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
As for whether the case brought by Lyman and his co-plaintiffs will continue, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move on".
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a lifelong critic of the Beast Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it doesn't have the same incentive and deterrence that responsibility poses.
He adds: "The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try".
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go your way, Burke, plaintiffs' lawyer, will put her other hundreds of plaintiffs on the line for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform is brought about", he says.
"Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy airing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a massacre in Norway in July that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time before his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We realised it wasn't that hard to reach them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report on European digital populism by the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook's cache of personal information is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been using it for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research", says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.
However, in a twist of sorts, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen".
DEMOS' work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in "likes", wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is driving a research boom, boosting the number of academic papers with the site's name in the title by almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't reach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to poll people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"You'd have to go through the party, and they'd never let you in", Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all that - you go to them directly".
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that college students who shared their drunken exploits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent about the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who posts too many status updates with his drunken habits.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it", said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post reported.
"We've found a way to identify at-risk children who otherwise would not be diagnosed".
Facebook is also constantly "picking" its own population for data.
The site's Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the voter turnout expectation in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (mostly using accessible information - longtime digital freedom advocates argue that the site should make its vast data available to others for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not - the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines for how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could be examining their profiles", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted with students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was just between them and their friends".
Then there's the question of methodology.
Even offline, there's no guarantee that a research subject is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it's impossible to know what part of a user's profile information and wall posts is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things", Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes a paperweight and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There's no substitute for going into the real world and talking to real people", he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social still happens offline".
"Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind behind two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway", he told a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court because it was mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism".
"I acknowledge the facts but plead not guilty".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views".
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm he is locked up.
Everyone attended with the goal of advancing to the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman", a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect".
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not mentally ill, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may take comfort in the fact that the attacks of July 22 appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I wish it looked like a monster, but it doesn't", said a relative of one victim.
"It would be a lot easier if it looked like it".
7 Lessons from the Lost Steve Jobs Interview, shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the tech genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs that has been dusted off as a preview of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows.
He was certainly a self-confessed designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a junkie of flowcharts - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a tremendous amount of work between a great idea and a great product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for over an hour with Jobs for a long, rare conversation.
At that time, it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working hard at his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly re-edited archival footage is the basis for Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, a 68-minute film that hits Landmark theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient because of Cringely's questions, pushing him to go faster toward the issues or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there's something strangely prophetic about The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It's one thing to read posthumous reviews of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after I explained everything in detail here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Throughout my years in business, I always asked, ""Why do you do things?" and the answers you invariably get are, "Oh, that's just the way it's done".
Nobody knows why they do what they do, in business nobody thinks things through very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs goes into detail about his efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Puzzled by the way costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was done on a case-by-case basis, and then adjusted with a "variable" - he developed an automated factory that he claimed could determine retail trade costs.
About the Pope joke:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" that he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make long distance calls for free.
There's been a lot written about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world a half dozen times and you were yelling through the pay phone and I was back a minute later at the pay phone next door", Jobs says with a chuckle.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world".
We two, we didn't know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope, while doing his best Henry Kissinger imitation.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst out laughing just before the pope himself was awakened to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling over the phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs landed a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees".
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
It was the size of a suitcase, had a small cathode ray tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I'd get a ride to HP as a teenager and waste my time with that machine and write programs for it.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Early in his career, as he was selling a handful of motherboards, a customer asked if he could assemble the entire equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to figure out how to assemble and deliver finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments -- they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300], and I got fed up and I went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for 15 dollars and that was totally reliable.
On the big companies losing their strength:
Long before he led the Apple revival, Jobs predicted the way many industry leaders would stumble in his vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers and printers, and what?"
You have a monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it's these kinds of people who end up running the companies and the people in charge of the products are pushed out of the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position is rotting because of people who don't have the notion of good products vs. bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
They took defeat from victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There's a tremendous amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows".
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make -- some things you can't make electrons do, glass does, robots do, factories do.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain -- these concepts -- adjust them all at once...
In the end, it all comes down to taste -- it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best that a team of humans has done, and then trying to adapt those things to what you're doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed about stealing great ideas.
What made the Macintosh great in part was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't for computer science, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with health care law rivals as the court accepts the case.
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to consider the politically controversial question of whether to accept President Obama's health care challenge, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were entertained at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will be presenting the case before the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to study the review petitions thoroughly.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the comprehensive health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
The magistrates agreed to admit the lawsuit to process and, in fact, a historic 5 1/2 hour plea is expected by March, and the outcome will likely further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and argue that the law should be struck down will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. attorney general under George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated for many years to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most prominent Republican in the Senate and a vocal opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at the dinner?
It's nothing new: Both judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, they would arguably fall under Canon Code 4C, which says: "A judge may attend fundraising events from law-related and other organizations, although the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor, or feature on the program of such an event".
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethic activists in the government.
"This impressive breach of ethics and indifference to the code runs counter to the demands of several judges that the court abide by the same rules that apply to all federal judges", said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges were entertained at a fundraising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the court".
Your appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any claim to impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in critics who say they blend the court's activity too easily with the agenda pushed by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the attorney general for the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were filed in the trial court.
Her critics have pressed Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in upholding the law to be impartial for now.
Kagan has given no indication that he will.
Boeing receives a record order for $ 18 billion
Emirates is ordering 50 double-aisle Boeing 777s, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at over a billion dollars.
It's rarely news when a company gets an order for 50 units of their product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 planes is a record $18 billion.
It's as big as the place where Boeing got the order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest ever order for commercial aircraft by dollar value - 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 jets.
The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, which would bring the total sale price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow.
Then on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel economy and spectacular passenger services.
The sale price for six of them is over a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing", said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong".
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil producing nations.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to the airlines, because it's one of the biggest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is making money from the rising price of oil.
That's important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural protection", he said.
The Emirates order solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps to keep at bay the attempt by its competitor Airbus SAS to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing's win at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co. shares are up 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote in Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón claims that the narcotics traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the gubernatorial race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderón appears to have lost her bid for governor of Michoacán during the violent state's election, and she claimed on Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime during the entire electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country", Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview a day after the vote on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our election workers... They took over the ballot boxes, set up barricades... and ordered people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hopeful of winning the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly outran Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate for his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the leftist candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the governorship, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It's President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against the traffickers in December 2006.
Yet the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidacies out of fear.
Although for the PRI, as unpleasant as the Michoacan elections may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, for next year".
The BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help bail out the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would impede growth in Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world's two largest and fastest growing economies needed to "do everything possible" to accelerate the economic bloc's recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries looking at Europe's difficulties in an "impartial" way and said that Asian financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together".
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful", he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune".
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means".
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility - offered greater bargaining power for Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and depleting foreign capital inflows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent", he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth".
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where do we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India's 1.2 billion people, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on holiday to the beaches and that will not be good", he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep the many well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs of poorly managed, loss-making companies like the railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens to have "important chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank's forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces "downside risks" due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts.
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta heated up Congress on Monday, warning that the impending automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and spark a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon hallways, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department", Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "sequestration", would result in 23 percent global cuts and a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate manner, would make most of our naval and construction projects unworkable - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts", Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily lay off many of our civilian officials and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to fire civilians in order to meet the target".
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our military and seriously damage the goodwill".
The cuts would eventually reach combat troops, Panetta said.
"While wartime funding in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by the hijacking, war efforts would be negatively affected by the severe disruptions in base budgets", Panetta warned.
"Personnel hiring would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and contract oversight supporting the war".
"The payroll staff would be reduced, leading to delays in wartime supplier payments, and legal and political support would be disrupted".
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a hijacking at the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power".
"We are firmly against this draconian action", the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not an outcome you can live with, and it is certainly not one we should impose on ourselves".
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it must not be allowed to happen".
Whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about possible cuts, even though he got a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budgeting experience in Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors".
"It's a brigade without bullets".
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots".
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to accomplish the mission", Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It's a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries".
"In fact, it invites aggression"...
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how the reductions "generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be deployed and engaged previously around the world; and pose an unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new land combat vehicle the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping development and further testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Spot a Lie
A glance at the latest headlines shows just how serious and pervasive deception and lying are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment allegations with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "caught" with an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a mockery of his denials quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And again, no one who lived through it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about cheating on school and college exams are widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given the test answers to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much of a hoax are we finding?
On any given day, studies show that you can be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
Sure, a lot of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Lying detection, or "lying tracking", is an essential skill that we all must acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game like, say, Charade, where the goal is to exclaim, "I've got you", cheat detection is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars do look you in the eye.
They don't always stutter, babble, blush, or get restless.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained polygraph can get to the truth by learning about the statement structure, microfacial expressions, question formations and timing.
I spent several years probing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or negotiation management.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, make them feel at ease, manage their own emotions, and intuitively sense how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-directed" lies, while women tell more "others-directed" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they usually tell tend to be "huge").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the subject's usual behavior.
This is called "creating a baseline".
It helps to provide reference points for measuring changes later.
Notice the subject's posture, laughter and vocal characteristics.
You better know if someone normally kicks your foot all the time so you don't make unfair accusations when you see your feet kicking in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for groups of deceptive behaviors, verbal and nonverbal.
Consider these behavioral groups as warning signs, not proof of deception.
People who cheat may freeze their upper body trying to remember their story, may point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a "post-interview gasp" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
Often the interrogators make it seem that the interview is over just to seek that post-interview relief.
He also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson went all out and used the time spent claiming his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide manhunt.
Cheating people may also use distancing language: "I did not have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal cues are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to be honest... as far as I'm... aware".
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to detect deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances of avoiding being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan diverted after the threat of US delay in approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating unions, while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to get back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada's executive, Alex Pourbax, says the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, though it is true that it will be on a different route.
This comes after the State Department announced last week that it would delay a decision on a federal permit for the project until new potential routes that bypass areas of the Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a vast underground water supply, are studied.
"This is a real road to progress", Rep. Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may set aside any decision until 2013, after next year's election, though officials denied that politics was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department, and expressed their full support.
The 1,700-kilometer pipeline would run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do that, you'd have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department's inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to throw up in fear.
A New York family claims that disco music diva Patti LaBelle behaved like a crazy person in the lobby of her Manhattan apartment building, terrifying her young daughter to the point that she threw up in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's rant scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers", her family says in Manhattan Superior Court.
It was November 10th of last year when streetcar driver Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was getting in the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes,' and I went to pick her up", he said.
LaBelle angrily rebuked the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't have left your daughter near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think".
He got angry and started using bad words - the C word and the J word out loud...
He had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water from the bottle at me".
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you've done to my daughter,'" said the girl's mother.
LaBelle leaped on the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be held back by her surroundings and pulled into a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard she threw up, he added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives have not returned calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and the family plans to donate all the money he makes to a children's cancer support association.
"The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her behavior", Davis said.
"That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when directed at a kindergarten teacher who is holding an 18-month-old child".
Climate adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's administration, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has fallen and the economy has contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-styled change, which generated great expectations regarding the progress in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, but instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of affectations by frosts, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damages in 582 thousand 835 cultivated hectares, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, maize and garbanzo.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year was observed to grow rapidly, as while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloenses were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate went to 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent, a rate that in number of people throws more than 74 thousand unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
"What we are seeing is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation that was approved in the congress to combat money laundering, and for people who grab dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something", he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state looking for work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties of entering, and second because entering they already have many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise", he said.
Informal use
The analysis of the Sinaloese labour market is aggravated by the high level of informality that prevails among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being co-paying as a worker to any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the labor lags of the state are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of Sinaloenses workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, far below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI contraction
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 the greatest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment of the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the state IED amounted to 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded during the same period of the previous year.
The State Government's Economic Development Secretariat, meanwhile, accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In view of the economic contraction, the state government requested in July to the state congress the approval of a credit for 3 billion pesos, which would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2 billion 600 million pesos, and until November have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of Mario López Valdés's government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensely to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, lacked align the effort of all and above all the good march already synchronized of this new team of Government, we hope that next year will be much better", he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López said events like the frosts of early this year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing much below the expectations we had", he said.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Patronal of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he said that it is required to accuse the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated", he said.
Work to be done
The Coparmex president stressed the importance of establishing a future vision that better aligns the Government's efforts.
"In general terms I would say that the Government has been striving to give good results in different matters, in terms of economic development there are some advances but it is important that a long-term program is developed", he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the Government is aware that there is work to be done", he said.
He 's been convicted of eight kilos of marijuana .
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fines for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General's Office said the narcomenudist sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for purposes of commerce.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcotic dealer was driving a white pickup truck, carrying a black bag in the trunk of the vehicle and a small backpack in the passenger seat, where the military found eight kilograms of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured was placed at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person remains interned at the Center for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
He owes contributions for works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Hábitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of municipal Social Development said that although the work programs have progressed, they are at risk because the State Government has not met the contributions that are due to it, which amount to a resource exceeding 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these becomes effective.
"They have almost 12 million to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth, when since July they should have given us a part", he said, "we have started the works and are very advanced, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not meet the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a credit to cover the more than 7 million that did not contribute at that time the state administration.
"It happened to us in the previous six years because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we to be able to access these programs we had to get the resources to cover what the State left pending", he said.
Despite the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to speed up the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them reach as soon as possible.
"They have almost 12 million to contribute and even though the year is almost over, they haven't given us a fifth".
Court rules "analog off" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals by digital ones is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have brought against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogic blackout" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to invalidate it did not come together.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be followed to concretise the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft judgment, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reserve.
The project was supported by Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenum of ministers also decided to dismiss the demand put forward by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister-president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal Executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for public administration to prepare.
"Neither do I think that if I did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the Federal Executive, who has as a constitutional mandate, the rectorate of the State.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital ones is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years, and it results in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the change, he said, would be postponing the benefits of digitalisation, which implies a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "since it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic rectorage of the State, includes a group of attributions that the Constitution leads to the faculty of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
He said the executive, by issuing the decree, is not in any way invading the sphere of Congress's powers, as it is providing in the administrative sphere for the observance of laws issued by the Legislature.
They analyze the possibility of a count "vote by vote" in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor election is just 27 percent, even without counting the votes for 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total acts.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the Program of Electoral Results Preliminary (PREP) the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is just 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total acts.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just last November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local norms with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As you may recall, Michoacán did not homologate its Political Constitution nor its Electoral Code of the State or its Law of Electoral Justice, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal term so that they could come into force in the present electoral process and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication in the timeframe provided for in the Law of the Official State Periodical, with the argument that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the state's vote on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal", since it has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counting of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes in one or more electoral packages may be carried out if the results of the minutes do not coincide, the minutes of vote and counting are not in the file of the box or are not in the possession of the president of the box, or if there are errors or obvious alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total number of votes received in all polling stations may be counted when there is evidence that the difference between the candidate presumed to have won the election in question and the candidate who has obtained second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that at the beginning of the sitting there is an express request from the representative of the party and/or coalition that nominated the second of the nominated candidates.
The total vote may also be counted if at the end of the ordinary count it is established that the difference between the presumed winner and the second-place candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate came in second place, in which case the electoral packages that have been the subject of partial counting shall be excluded.
It should be noted that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between first and second place is just 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total acts.
His last will and testament
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, during the Monday were held recognitions and a requiem mass.
According to his relatives, the last wish of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé.
After receiving a tribute alongside the other people who died in the accident, Bacio Cortés' family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At 12 noon, the ashes of Lieutenant Colonel arrived at the chapel of veiling located on the Nazario Ortiz Garza boulevard, where they were arriving family and friends.
At 5:30 p.m. he was given a recognition at the Saltillo Technological Institute organized by his former colleagues from the technological bachelor's and the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was a part during his bachelor's preparation.
"His will was to return to Saltillo and his ashes were scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé, he always expressed this to his family and friends", Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister, said.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all her dreams, she considers that she was in the fullness of her life, "he was a successful man, extraordinary as a father, as a son, a loving brother and the caregiver of his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the Air School in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe him because they said that he even got dizzy in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "just was in Saltillo all the family wanted to greet him, like the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopan for his relative's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
They say their final goodbyes
With honors was dismissed the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, in tribute that headed the governor Jorge Torres López, and that he surrendered people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, directors and students of the Saltillo Technological, where he studied in 1985 and stood out both in the study and in sports.
Bacio Cortés, died in the past days when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, along with the secretary of the Governorate, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of that department.
At 18:05 hours the remains of the Saltillense Bacio Cortés (cremated) arrived, to be delivered by the funeral home to members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the plant, where he was already awaited by his relatives, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
They've located three abandoned bodies at Cadereyta NL estate.
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot in different parts of the body and shot in the chest, in an abandoned farmhouse in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find happened at the 1.5 kilometer of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by the house noticed that the door to the beige-colored coffee barred farmhouse was wide open.
Looking inward, about ten feet [3 m], they found the bodies of three people, and immediately alerted the authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark, unbuttoned mixed pants; next to him was another wearing a white strap-on T-shirt.
Barely a foot away was the body of another individual in a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three of them were lying face down.
According to the data obtained at the scene, the three people were killed elsewhere, as no casings were found at the site.
The bar of the fifth floor features legends that go from one organized crime group to another, as well as several bullet holes in the bar and the gate.
They've captured 11 in Cadereyta.
The Secretariat of National Defense made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" and clandestine inhumations.
According to the information given, in a first event on November 11 in the colony Los Alveros were detained eight people and managed to rescue one who remained deprived of his freedom.
They were given three properties and a cell phone; they claimed to be members of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another incident on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel conducted a surveillance tour in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without plates and two subjects on board.
When the military stopped and inspected, they found a long gun, a magazine, and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, on November 13 at 14:00 hours, one of his accomplices was arrested in the ejido La Frauda, who, seeing the military, tried to flee.
They are attributed clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Tiran, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italy's newly appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the president of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, will meet Wednesday with President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet made up mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present to the president the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the countries which will be eligible for the EU's assistance.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The 'framework is now well delineated', he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, far less than normal, as Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore battered confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to act quickly, market instability put the yield on Italian 10-year BTP bonds above 7%, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be bailed out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers' Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot".
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were boosted considerably by the backing of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result", said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began on Monday consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organisations.
He'll end his round of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italy's debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Bailing out Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone's current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before elections are brought forward.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist it should be made up of only technicians, an indication of his reservations about a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish rub is superior to the Ticos
Of the 22 players called up from Spain, ten have played more than 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 called up made it to the 50 games.
A stark contrast to Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 called by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly ranking, have a wide record of A-class inter-section games, the Tricolor only have defender Michael Umaña as the only one with all 50 international games.
This figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the English Premier League, maintain a year of intense activity in league and domestic cup championships, and high-level clashes in European cups such as the Champions League.
The experience with the Spanish Furia in the Euro and World Cup qualifiers is also worth mentioning.
Tico footballers, on the other hand, have limited international exposure in a zone, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish Selection is of the archer Íker Casillas, who on Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equalled the record of the exporters Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and set a new record for Spain of 127 internationals.
Xavi Hernandez, the brains of Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the week before by UEFA along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the ram of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost a century behind Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with [ Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the Tico side, and close to Michael Umaña, are left-back Júnior Díaz, with 48 appearances and artilleryman Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have made it past the 30-game mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least of them.
With more than 30 appearances in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) are among the most successful players in the history of the Spanish league.
On the national side, with fewer than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest of them don't get anywhere near 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have yet to debut.
Spain's all-time leading scorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the record holder with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in its two-decade tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to perform one of their best shows yet next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It's been over 20 years of waiting, but the band says that for them too it will be a dream come true to play in the country.
This was confirmed by bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is on the South American side of their two-decade tour and will make their only stop in Central America on Sunday.
They will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the angeline band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is at The Nation on the Internet.
For their Costa Rican fans, it's a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are going through?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I ask because there's a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the days before.
What do they tell their most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to his concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the last 21 years happened in the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully that's gotten us in shape for this gig in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing.
My friends were always going to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, they're great places to surf, and that's how we found out, from people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with a lot of songs.
What have you got planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We're going to try to put on the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we're going to try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You guys never repeat the repertoire.
What's this about?
I think part of it's because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to pick which songs to play every night.
When you have two or three songs in your repertoire that you haven't played in a while, it keeps you focused and also keeps you surprised because it reminds you of the reasons why you liked those songs and that you may have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they're celebrating 20 years.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all they've accomplished?
Yes, I certainly did.
First of all, I think none of us imagined that we'd be in a great rock band and having done it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We keep counting our blessings and we're so excited that we can keep making music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We're lucky to be able to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean to you to be a key part of the rise of grunge?
It's always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We're very close friends with the people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement comes from a group of friends and it's something unusual.
Every once in a while, a band from a city comes out, but it's much stranger when five or ten bands come out of the same city at the same time.
We're proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them now and then.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to still be friends with all of them and we're honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It's also very strange that a band like yours can stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yeah, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is a lot longer than most bands last.
First, I think we're all lucky to still be alive, and second, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also opened up that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy, but thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do they find a balance?
As we've grown, it's been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you don't be too much of a touring act because it's easy to fall into that game of the big crowds and the people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you should respect the music and what it brought, not get all cranky about being famous and being a rock star, something none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some really good songs and at first it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and we never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of frustrations because it lasted this long and the most important thing is that we're still very good friends with Bruce and Greg, who started the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think about the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and so much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yeah, the production sent us videos with several suggestions and that was the band we liked the most, so we're looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics to Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he sings it with the first thing that comes to his mind.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
There's so many of them.
Among the first ones that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge relevant even though it's no longer a fad?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the other bands that came out at the same time, and, if it's relevant now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever before.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that might seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs even though they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them to me, I cried when I heard them and they're deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, they definitely represent that for me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that's dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is admitted again for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for a loss of muscle strength in his legs, his primary care physician said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including tongue cancer, for which he has undergone four operations and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he does not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He was operated four times for cancer of the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which have been added other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people at the hands of an army death squad that operated clandestinely in the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the high point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collectivity of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propitious for the exchange of information on all political matters between the two nations", according to the South American country's presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that emerged when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries which remain tax havens, a statement which provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation of its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairman of the G20 since November, a group of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has an agreement with the South American country to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguay Round of multilateral taxation agreements was concluded in December 1994 and the Uruguay Round of multilateral taxation agreements were signed in December 1995.
In trade, Mexico and Uruguay have a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place since 2004, which has increased trade in goods between the two nations.
The mustachioed plumber goes through the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before had he done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which hits stores around the world this month, has been designed from the ground up to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows three-dimensional play without the need for glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopy without glasses should work", said Nintendo's Spanish press officer Omar Álvarez during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support", as so far successes like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has maintained that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Alvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the more experienced will be able to give a "second round" to the levels of the game, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This foray into three-dimensions of Super Mario also means the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that had not been produced since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo winked at the fans of the series and repeated the formula of the success of previous installments, consisting of the plumber of the mustache having to travel through platforms mined with dangers in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find new moves, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had given a process for extradition of ex-governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for conspiracy to launder US$70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to be tried there.
In a press conference, Colom said his decision was based on the independence of the judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a sentencing court had already ordered the extradition.
He said that during his term he "did not get his hands on" judicial resolutions and handed over all the extraditions he has seen.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for narcotics trafficking, will be extradited.
Colom's actions are an executive procedure after all judicial and constitutional procedures to prosecute the former president from 2000 to 2004 were exhausted.
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzling Q120 million from the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 at-risk youths
The entity was born to prevent the fall in the marginality of untrained children
The first 25 years of the Trinijove social support institution are important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation over the course of this quarter century.
In addition, there are over 100 jobs currently being created for this social group.
The anniversary was marked yesterday by a large event in the former Fabra i Coats factory complex, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighbourhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little education, without work, with learning difficulties or in a situation of falling into marginalization.
The celebration in Sant Andreu yesterday brought together a large number of officials from entities and institutions that have been collaborating with the association for 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full election time, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
The event was attended by the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and former mayor and current ecosocialist councillor Ricard Gomà.
The current Councillor for Social and Family Welfare, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director general of social work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the Fabra i Coats grand hall.
But he said Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is too, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President cited Trinijove as an example of how to fight against bad circumstances and give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and the work it does", he said.
A farmhouse occupied by the makrofests was evicted
The invaders had taken over 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the estate yesterday at noon without offering any resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of 51 rue de Balmes lived in has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building yesterday at noon voluntarily, where they were organizing a neighborhood-wide mass mass, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was over, the door lock was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on there will be access control", the administrator said.
The occupants, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installations and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the massive parties, which lasted up to two days and despairing tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the disco points out that the invaders of the finca were making unfair competition, as they sold the glasses at three euros, while in the disco they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had to respond to neighbour complaints about noise, while, according to her, the discomfort is not caused by the customers of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, by the attendees to the parties that were organized there, which had increased in frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The head of the disco explained that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and nine months ago "forgave" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the city, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately dislodge the building to end the problems of coexistence and civism that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the past few months the occupiers had been entering all floors of the building and almost all floors, and that in some even robberies have occurred.
He added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be strong against the incivism that has been generated in the finca".
Also yesterday, the Mossos cleared a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police headed to 35 Calle de Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people entering the building.
All four were arrested at the scene.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversies over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the height of the now-defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional posters for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In fact, it was accompanied by a comparison, in numbers, to New York's Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again located, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a nature park is based on this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the boars playing the role of Yogi the bear.
In September, the city council called a mega-competition of 16 competitions for as many doors to Collserola.
A doorway is a reference to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone's trying to put doors in the field.
The question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it involves of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It's almost a recurring theme to pick up when two members of this ancient elite cast recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact leads, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between the views of three Barcelona architects, and university professors, who have come forward.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after tackling the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to debate "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, the one of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is to be assumed that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, it is very accessible.
Collserola is more complex", says the architect, for whom the title "Collserola's doors" contains a "lexicological trap": they should not be thought of "as accesses to a park, but as the delimitation of areas where action is needed".
Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertainty that is today projecting the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of boundaries on where to build.
"To limit something is to set the next step", that is, to overstep it.
"We must think of new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM) ] can lead to real disasters".
More closely adhering to the question, Mòdol believes that, in a simplified way, the Vallès side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", for a mere topographical question.
Mòdol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat of Collserola that "should not fall into a broken sack", although he is grateful for the opportunity that the city offers to his guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe passage that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a hit", he points out) that have had to be created: "The architects should be only a tool".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, because in the basis of the competition there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "16 transversal competitions have been called - he says - in the direction of mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means that you have chosen to participate in all 16 contests.
Otherwise, a design for one of the doors may clash in program and definition with that of the architect of the door next door.
In his view, yes, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Ronde de Dalt should provide, throughout its length, an area of facilities that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and he will walk free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal representative of the Casino Red granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the process that was followed for alleged blackmail
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of the Casino Red granted him a pardon before the Second Penal District Court, which is pursuing a process of blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale attack, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonás demanded payment of an economic fee for the regiomontano city council to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public complaint, the state prosecutor's office opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panist mayor and on September 2 he was arrested and jailed for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agente del Ministerio Público 3 in Patrimoniales, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days after being issued a second arraignment order after the Public Ministry agent dismissed the cohecho and organized crime charges.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta penitentiary allegedly for blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with a million and a half pesos; however, he only remained a few hours in the medium security prison as there were death threats against him.
Authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was turned over an arrest warrant by the secretary of the Second District Penal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after nearly two months of investigations, enough evidence was found to determine Jonas' guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went to judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the mayor regio; so in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Ministry agent assigned to the court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez about whether the damage had been repaired and which of the partners of the gambling house was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
Based on the 197/2011 file, Jonas Larrazábal is granted legal pardon and no further claims can be made regarding the process that followed him; in addition, he will not be required to pay compensation for damage or punishment.
After the hearing with the legal representative of the gambling house, at about 15:50 Larrazabal Bretón was ordered to be released immediately.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the jail in San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be archived.
You will also be notified of the judge's immediate release order.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash that killed Secretary of State Francisco Blake and seven others
The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) said the results of the accident that killed the secretary of the Governorate, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others, indicate that the helicopter impacted directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transportation, said that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"Elements that appear to indicate the unit had multiple contact with the ground, blades had contact with trees 25 meters away where the unit lost the fuselage".
He also said the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport personnel.
He also said that in the investigations done in the impact area there is no report of the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"On a search, it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact occurred structurally.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, with adequate requirements for transporting passengers.
The terrain has a seven-degree slope at a 30-degree incline.
The Secretary of State said that the priority was to get results as soon as possible, but that the investigation could take several months, even up to a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, director general of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said the helicopter of the Presidential Staff was operating at cruise speed at the time of the impact.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact", he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations the flight was performed under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reports from the AICM indicated that conditions were suitable for takeoff, as the aircraft advanced toward the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, layers of low-lying clouds were present.
Routes selected:
It is likely that the crew sought a lower elevation and better visibility to the Cuernavaca Valley due to the cloudy conditions.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the aircraft's last radar record match, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a restricted area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred in a straight, lateral path.
The pattern of dispersal of aircraft debris suggests that the helicopter impacted the ground in structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion was detected:
At the crash site, there is still no evidence in the wreckage of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest investigation results indicate he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During fieldwork, aircraft parts have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above mean sea level, the terrain showing a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably disassembled along this route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search of a wider area than the cordoned off site, around the crash, no scattered pieces of the aircraft have been found, strengthening the presumption that the impact occurred in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find gene for obesity
Social Security conducts research to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting a research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called protocol 'Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence', which will allow to have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital of Speciality of the National Medical Center Century XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
The team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the National Polytechnic Institute's Research and Advanced Studies Center (Cinvestav).
The research is invited to participate in the population whether or not entitled, go to the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday from 8:00 am.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico West) and that since October 8, the activity is being carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico East).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and identify in children and young Mexicans risk factors to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
The aim of the World Diabetes Day, which is being celebrated on 14 November, is to bring together three thousand children and young people aged between six and 14 years, with the consent and supervision of their parents, to apply specific questionnaires on nutrition.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He said that on Saturdays, all participants were given anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure readings, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels and genetic tests (to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López said the investigation was prompted by health professionals' concern about the alarming increase in weight among children.
'Health surveys in 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years there was a 77 per cent increase in obesity among boys and 47 per cent in obesity among girls; there was also a dramatic rise in overweight', the IMSS specialist said.
He said the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian, 30 percent European and five percent African heritage and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translate into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and which is stored as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive assessment of the children, which allows them to detect whether they are overweight or obese.
He even said that there were dark folds (acanthosis) in his neck and forearm, indicating that he may have metabolic changes and even prediabetes.
The information is kept confidential, and the doctors give it in writing to the parents, who are told about each of the measures and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the television and using means of transportation instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, i.e. the greater consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics that are analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt from UNAM would prevent potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the paving were attended to, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 thousand potholes each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt paving is adequate, potholes could be reduced in quantity or, even, eliminated completely.
In his lecture A Technological Opinion of Potholes, delivered as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he revealed that his laboratory develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to asphalt but with greater mechanical strength, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltens, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it presents a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
The above means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is changing during the day according to environmental conditions and temperature, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt sheath, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the pebbles that make up the folder, he said, is covered with asphalt.
As vehicles move and effort is generated, this allows forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
Over the asphalt sheath, abundantly, is placed a final layer called a rolling sheath, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
Since it is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt foil and provide friction on the road.
As the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the effort, the rolling stock also requires proper thickness and care of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it affects the performance of the asphalt foil considerably.
When the soil becomes wet, water diffuses into the inside of the carpet and is difficult to get out, this causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a pothole, he said, the first to wear out is the rolling film and only then is the asphalt foil affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but is a process that should be addressed at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The National System of Researchers member explained that vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the pavement should always be in relation to vehicle load and ensure that it is met, to avoid potholes forming frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to research and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even on the market and allow repairing potholes easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valley's candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Señorita Colombia.
The Valley receives her 14th princess title.
Once again the Cauca Valley is getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and the sceptre, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of women valley caucanians who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Arenas (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question many people ask today is, what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision taken by the jury to designate her First Princess is that she was not convinced by her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Carretera Leamos.
To the questioner the Caucasian valley replied:
"I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it's a way of getting cultured, I definitely think the book that marked me as a child is 'The Little Prince,' it's a pretty deep book.
I am currently reading Crime and Punishment, a book of universal literature that we should all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a beautiful book called The Burning of Blood".
A response that she did not like, firstly because of the term "culturalisation" and secondly because she did not explain in a concrete way how each of the books she cited has marked her.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina expressed feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise happens what has to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses put forward, it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotá journalist insinuated that being the favorite, the one who received the ovations and the candidate who took all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage".
And that was evident in her first bathing suit appearance on the beach at the Hilton and her two coronation night shows.
Although she looked confident in both, she was lacking the strength and drive that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic did.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "As at home", of the RCN Channel, opined that the fact that Melina was designated princess "proves that the candidate who wins the most awards during the contest does not remain as queen".
Also, Valle was very elusive with the press at the end, and that's where he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For some reason, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we have to look beyond the physical and focus on their social sensitivity, that before entering the Contest are already involved in projects", she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the back and the fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The coach of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, which the truth for me was not very noticeable, she dropped points in the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos, believes that the mistake of the valley of the Caucan was the surgical interventions that were practiced.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle couldn't do them.
Her body was never her strong point and she was charged here".
For this award, which for the first time gives the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in bathing suit came a cruel vaticinio that last night was fulfilled, because it was said that this was the container that Raymundo granted to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Whether it is true or not, Melina is starting a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, eluded the crown.
That was the work of the calligrapher who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A lofoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lofoscopist from the Cali CTI went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC's top leader: "Alfonso Cano", through the cotejo of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopists who work in the CTI section, that week Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years, was on the "availability" shift.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in Chocó municipalities, where he often had to go into the jungle for more than five days to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after completing the corresponding courses, he specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar was warned to wear minimum clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be that of the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to carry the decadactilar card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the search team at the site of the body, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance, which was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local peasant, no glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplant and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints from the corpse with those on the card.
His eye didn't miss: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the top FARC chief.
Searching for the print
For a Sijín of Cali dactiloscopist the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can be key in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, lofoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of people caught.
When caught, many criminals present false IDs or no papers.
We take their fingerprints and run them through the database.
The investigator related that in one case of theft, he had to remove a piece of a wall from a house, because the thief had leaned his hand on that place to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not proper surfaces to take a fingerprint, but in that case we could get the fingerprint of the entire hand and identify the delinquent, who had participated in different thefts", he recalled.
Fingerprints can also rule out or reinforce suspects in homicide cases.
A man was found dead recently, liquor bottles all around him.
The investigation determined that a family member could be a suspect in the crime and indeed a print on the bottle matched.
Although this doesn't guarantee that he was the killer, it does place him at the scene of the crime.
A typist at the ITC explained that on objects "fingerprints are taken with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a graft or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians", the CTI expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the television show CSI.
Just as not everything that glitters is gold, not everything you touch becomes a footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective co-ordination is carried out.
"Indignant" defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were crowding outside Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part of them complied with the eviction order and moved to a nearby parish.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter the Manhattan square where they were evicted in the early hours of the morning and by trying to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order allowing the "indignant" to camp there again, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to camp out in the square again, we will move somewhere else and continue the legal battle to get back to Zuccotti, as well as through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations", said one of the spokesmen for the Occupy Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the response of the "indignant" to the eviction of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the site and allowing the protesters to remain camped.
In addition, the "indignant" people occupied a new park at the junction of downtown Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, and owned by Trinity Church Parish.
For at least an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the Police went and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says several hundred people had moved into the area, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in support of the movement and tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private property - remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday to discuss the legality of the early morning evacuation.
Some of the protesters who were displaced were carrying and distributing copies of the court order and even handing them over to the officers guarding the square, which caused "some small confrontations", Bray said, denouncing that some officers beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting Occupy Wall Street members or enforcing "laws that were issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with shops or other properties they used previously".
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the protesters, who he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with tents and sleeping bags.
The regidor personally defended the eviction carried out in the early hours of the morning from the Zuccotti square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people were not coming to protest, but to violate laws and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that at its core Bloomberg is more interested in preserving financial interests than those of American workers", added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "lacking respect for freedom of expression".
The "Ocupa Wall Street" officials also said they plan to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two-month protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas television special.
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", a lifeguard on "Baywatch", Playboy's bunny, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private television station CTV announced today that Anderson, along with crooner Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, bringing to life a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today released footage of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread internet distribution of a pornographic home video in which she appears alongside her then-husband, "Mötley Crüe" drummer Tommy Lee, is seen dressed as the Virgin Mary holding a doll in a manger representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as host on part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan reborn after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe the country has suffered since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government put the material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have subsided.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the Gross Domestic Product data for July and September turned the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and by 6% in annualized terms.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also represents the highest growth rate since January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the uptick in the purchase of machinery for restoring areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Indeed, firms increased their investments by 1.1%, compared with the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decrease after six months of uninterrupted increases.
The real upturn in the Japanese economy, however, is not solely based on the Keynesian drive to use crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use the shortages to grow from scratch.
Japan has reawakened, largely thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has committed itself to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "safe havens" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the gloomy US outlook, a privilege that weighs heavily on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic buoyancy is determined by the health of big tech groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed their weak results between July and September to the yen's price.
As markets continue to besiege the peripheral countries of the EU, the government of Yoshihiko Noda does not let down its guard.
"We must be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen", said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the outlook is not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates turning points in the world economy highlighted that the major powers are slowing down.
It's down four tenths to 100.4 points, down from 100.8 in August.
The euro area was even below the average, which is at the 100 level, falling eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again feeds into doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives won't sign any written commitment.
With peripheral risk premiums soaring and uncertainty re-established in the parks, Greece continues to be entangled in the maze leading to the exit from Europe's great debt crisis.
The feeling that the 'consensus' of the new Greek transitional government is being imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by genuine political conviction is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the one hundred-day period agreed in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections on the scheduled date, 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October", Papadimos said when opening a parliamentary debate yesterday that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not remove any doubt about his position: "We have committed to help the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else".
The Conservative leader was a step further on his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the $8 billion Athens urgently needs, and made clear that he would not give his approval to any letter of commitment to compliance with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still reeling from the impact of Papandreou's referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "an unambiguous written commitment as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8.000 million, although no definitive date has been set.
The Greek wire still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "prevailing" position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a leading position in the world in the role of microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the plante in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" she said lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to reach the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with horizon 2015, and, "especially, in the one that has as a goal the reduction to half of the volume of people living with incomes below a dollar a day, with which the "threshold of poverty" is fixed.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate in the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", main beneficiaries of these loans.
It is "many achievements" and "many challenges we face".
The Microfinance Summit is not only a forum for debate but also a platform from which to promote 'two basic goals'.
His Majesty explained that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families will have accessed these financial services and 100 million of those households will be out of poverty.
The impetus in the conception of micro-credits in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path started years ago as a pioneer" by Muhammad Yunus, highlights Doña Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the founder of the tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of poverty eradication", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about its lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all of them I have been able to see the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose link with this project earned him yesterday the title of "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid by the "baquero of the poor".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The minister of foreign affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
He said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to economic boom times, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said that micro-credits are "a serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty", and that now "more than ever" governments in developed countries must work together to ensure that they are not the victims of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to people "excluded from whom everyone closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the attendees to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, went without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially on the agenda, but the issue was brought up in the autumn, in particular to satisfy activists who feel that the government's policy is currently too unconstrained with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes won by Angela Merkel and, after several hours, by Wolfgang Schäuble, the Euro-phile Minister of Finance, dispels any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a slogan: the response to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because 'nine million jobs depend directly on the euro'.
The Chancellor said: "The time has come to make a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be seen in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to allow for greater control by the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to 'give Europe a face'.
In any case, that is one of the proposals in the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that the 27 will quickly reach agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the ball is on the field.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment in the Community.
The Chancellor, anxious to calm the mood within her party, has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has not tried to win her congress at the expense of the 'small' European countries or the countries in difficulty who are willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of 'French-German friendship', Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except by the way.
Remembering that two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of fraud in sickness insurance
After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against the casualties by disease.
Mr Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund and deliver a speech on the recurring theme of social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which starts from the will to save rigorously, but still reminds of an axis of the presidential campaign of the right, the majority wants to focus on the casualties by disease.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day's absence on private sector workers before they can take leave.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly earnings.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
It would also be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose a day's unpaid leave on employees in the event of a work stoppage (until now, they have no leave, compared with the three days applied in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority also bring back the issue of fraud, this time aimed at the abuse of workplace workers.
"The controls will be considerably increased and, in addition, if someone is found to be committing fraud, he will have to repay the amounts", warned Xavier Bertrand speaking on RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly out of proportion to the reality of the workplace leave fraud.
In fact, since 2002 this issue has been constantly monitored and various policy offensives have been launched which have usually borne fruit.
The French don't get sick more than the rest of Europe.
Let us first look closely at the national figures.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), more than 237 million euros in sickness benefits were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, sickness benefits accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this total, 46% is related to maternity and accident leave, while 54% is related to sick leave, amounting to EUR 6.2 billion.
So 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed not to have taken a single day off for sickness.
Another study, in this case by the Assurance maladie, shows that in 2010 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
Compared with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long-term study carried out in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS showed that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health and other reasons) ranged in France from 10% to 11%, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% to 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sickness pay is not particularly significant compared with undeclared work.
The fraud has a fairly limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found that in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, the short-term losses were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of the more than 45-day losses, subject to systematic inspections, 11% of the cases were considered to be 'duly adjusted or unjustified; a figure which, starting from a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
This brings the total to 169,000 'unjustified' cases among several million workers who took sick leave.
Certainly, a negligible figure compared, for example, with black-collar work.
According to Dominique Tian, MP for the UMP, who wrote a report on the subject in June, this would result in a loss of tax revenue of between EUR 9 and 15 billion a year, more than the total cost of sickness benefits and certainly considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece is going to need a new adjustment plan to straighten out its economy.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
'To make efforts to bring the economy back to life, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme,' declared the Head of Government, delivering his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the countries which are eligible for the EU's assistance.
As a result, Papadémos has forecast that the country's public deficit will fall "to around 9%" of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures", he said during a meeting with deputies from his New Democracy party.
He said he was in favour of deficit and debt reduction and waste reduction but against any policy that would impede economic recovery.
The European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Olli Rehn, warned that the IMF and EU would not unlock the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee of all parties' support for the planned measures.
An expert committee says euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live in denial of death, says report from Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just for cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of a major report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts from various fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia when the patient is faced with such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
With or without medication, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, even though most Canadians wish to die at home, 68.6 percent of them end up dying in a hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this respect is recorded in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Penal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or are not a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
The report's co-author, Jocelyn Downie, said yesterday via teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide had not been legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favor of euthanasia, believing that it would allow people who are about to die to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people are of less value.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe that no proceedings should be initiated against them.
The situation with regard to the maintenance or interruption of health care for a patient is not so clear, the report authors say.
In addition, among its recommendations, it suggests that it be stated in the Penal Code that the withdrawal of healthcare, if legally refused, is not a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also calls for training of health professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient can refuse care at the end of his life without fear of being sued.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just for cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian healthcare institutions, the Committee calls for it to be considered as euthanasia and subjected to the same procedures, unless it is used to reduce physical pain.
Other experts have reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts signing the report "extreme", not least because euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill patients.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 can ask for help to commit suicide", says Deschamps, who yesterday consulted a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also stresses that the report's authors seem to prioritise personal autonomy over any other value in society.
But he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
Health Law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the report's conclusions, which she called "manifestly pro-euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, also of the Royal Society of Canada, especially questions the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's king urges President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy" against the Syrian government
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad's supporters demonstrated yesterday outside the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Bashar al-Assad's Syria intensified, which, with the support of Russia, is resisting it and denouncing that there is a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League suspended Syria, the European Union has tightened sanctions on Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, have spoken out in favour of President Assad's abdication.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, as well as create the conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said he regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave", he declared, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the Arab League and European Union's decisions to "strengthen the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly tough line" on the crackdown in Syria, says State Department spokesman Mark Toner.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces have already lost their lives in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) has announced.
Two other civilians have died "during heavy shelling and machine gun fire in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, the NGO said.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem said the country was "moving towards the end of the crisis".
The European Union has also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend its functions in Damascus, which it considers a 'dangerous step'.
Syria "will not falter", he added, guaranteeing that "the plots plotted against Syria will fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "civilian protection mechanism" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé, has also expressed support for the deployment of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he says is in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November, which provides in particular for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities held by the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan from the crisis, although it did not support the imposition of possible sanctions against Damascus.
The Commission
Monti asks time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time for the markets to form their team and launch a programme that will include "sacrifices" aimed at regaining the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner debated yesterday with the political parties and today he met with the trade unions and employers.
He should form a relatively small cabinet, made up of technocrats outside Parliament.
'Monti has spoken of a broad programme with many sacrifices,' said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups taking part in the meetings, after meeting the appointed President of the Council.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he hoped that Mario Monti would ask for a vote of confidence in Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list of no doubt a dozen Ministers to the Head of State, Mr Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise time limits" for forming a Government and preparing its programme, he stressed, adding that he is "confident that the markets will have patience and will understand".
His appointment as President initially won the approval of the markets, but then there was concern, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government must operate until 2013, the date of the next legislative, he considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that 'even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change'.
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving budgetary balance in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further stringent measures.
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, which calls for the EU to take a more active role in the fight against terrorism.
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of epoch" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconiism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", the editors claim.
The big unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place some 200 billion euros in government bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with Iran's nuclear program.
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in developing a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
In identifying the investigator, the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA expressed its "grave concern" last week about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic explosion diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert who not only knew the technique well but also, as one member state has reported to the Agency, worked for most of his career on such technology in his home country's military nuclear program".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while, over the same period, other types of racial and religious violence have declined or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, compared with a 13% increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and offences.
The total number of "hate crimes" has risen slightly to 6,628, of which 47.3 percent are due to racial differences and 20 percent to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that such crimes have re-emerged", Human Rights First said. "The increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant", the organization said in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long argued that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds Paul Legendre, a senior human rights official.
"The U.S. government can and should work to end such abuses", he adds, noting that such efforts could include improving police reporting on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the civil rights era.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence based on race, color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter modified the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes its service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another called "name" allow you to more legibly and live follow the activity of other "Twittos", that is, those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") you follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This lets you know if they follow up on messages, subscribe to new accounts, rate a message as a favorite, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before being rolled out to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi à un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable à celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users have been debating the interest of this innovation through "tweets" with different opinions.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much like Facebook", writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature is going to help me better follow some elements of my Twitter feed", writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budgetary 'golden rule' in the Constitution
The ruling Social Democratic/Christian Democrat grand coalition government in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a budgetary "golden rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade of Austria's sovereign rating by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Socialist Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers meeting, when the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an extra EUR 3 billion in interest each year", said Christian Democrat Vice-Chancellor for Foreign Affairs Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus responding to a request from the Brussels summit of 26 October to the euro area Member States, in which the Heads of State or Government called for the reduction of the public deficit and the restoration of the balance of public accounts to be included in the Constitution or in a law of equivalent value before the end of 2012.
The Austrian Government's approach is similar to the 'German model', as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a 'rule'.
By 2017, the structural government deficit should decrease each year by 0,75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the federal government structural deficit should not exceed 0,35% of GDP each year, while the regional states, as well as the municipalities, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt to the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
A strong yen
No threat of further foreign exchange intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would re-intervene in the currency mark-up if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to near historic highs brought on by the Japanese authorities' intervention on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold off massive yen for dollars to bring down the value of the Japanese currency, which had just hit a new record since 1945 against the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been steadily rising since then, driven by purchases by investors who see it as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and a debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen below 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those caused by the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at over 160 yen.
This explosion in the Japanese currency is hurting the archipelago's exports, since it makes Made in Japan products more expensive and reduces the value of the income generated abroad by Japanese companies when they convert it into the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Noda said, fearing that the rise in the yen will cut the weak recovery.
The world's third largest economy has recovered in the third quarter (by 1.5% on the previous quarter) for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption by households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister felt that the high yen level did not reflect "Japan's economic foundations".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's Deputy Governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", implying that no further monetary flexibility should be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting in late October, the issuer increased its purchases of Treasury bills by five trillion yen (€47 billion), bringing the threshold for funds for the acquisition of various financial securities to 55 trillion yen (€519 billion) to flood the liquidity market.
The euro area:
The guys grow, the bags weaken.
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to weigh on European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, and improved growth in France and Germany, rates in the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the stability of the euro area, European stock markets sink a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 o'clock, the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3.064 points.
The Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"In light of the new tensions in relation to loan yields in the most affected euro area countries, stock markets worldwide continue to reap some of their recent gains".
"Investors, nervous, are well aware of the risk of contagion", said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, as quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, renewing market participants' concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, is looking to Europe and trade will continue to be conducted within a narrow range of variation, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilised", said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The re-emergence of concerns about the future of the euro area is affecting the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, a drop of 0.4%.
According to traders, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that provides, in particular, for the option for a struggling country to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates exceed 6%
The credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds was 6.85%, while Spanish bonds at the same maturity were 6.2%.
These tensions over interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which risks suffocating under the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, said that implementing the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the crosshairs of the markets, while on Sunday the legislative elections will be held there.
The spread between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
Statistically, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a more favourable figure than the 0.3% forecast, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, revised down the second-quarter figure, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stagnation.
Besides, the fourth quarter is what really worries economists.
Germany, on the other hand, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m. after the European Commission warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogma.
If there is one issue that cannot be dealt with by considering short-term considerations or simply by thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is fitting that an election meeting should be the time to reflect on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it considers the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we have seven billion people on the planet, the demographic evolution will mean that the demand for electricity will double by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing scarcity of fossil resources must be addressed in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Germany is therefore alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or in Switzerland, which is only concerned with building the latest generation of power stations.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, are moving ahead with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
The German model of renewable energy is sometimes cited as an example, but the reality is quite different.
The choice of Berlin will mean higher electricity prices, greater energy dependence on increased imported gas, particularly from Russia, and increased CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal-fired power stations.
In a few months, the damaging effects will be felt.
The case of Denmark is worth considering.
Europe's champion in the wind sector, which generates 30% of its electricity, is also a major user of coal and gas because of the intermittency of the wind.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would undermine the realism of the wonderful statements about reindustrialising our country and defending our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and are not in fact opposed to this type of energy in principle, according to surveys.
We must remember that the energy policy of our country has failed to build an industrial sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Export-oriented in scope, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specialised in international markets and capable of creating jobs that cannot be relocated.
If France were to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of 6 billion euros a year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to run for 60 years when its manufacturer is scheduled to collapse?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the aid is compatible with the internal market.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France we have a safety authority which exercises strict and transparent control over both the existing power stations and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, with their recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In the last half century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, the Three Mile Island accident, occurred under normal operating conditions; it caused no consequences to people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to reactor design and unforgivable human error.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did from the two previous ones.
Thanks to these developments and cooperation between safety authorities and French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR is designed to withstand such phenomena.
While all the electricity players who wish to build a power station are studying it, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift to Areva's and EDF's competitors, since it would leave them free to assume leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogma and partisan maneuvering dominate a debate so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration - A Burden or an Opportunity for the Economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a 'country of human rights'.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made headlines, with the Interior Minister (see Libération newspaper of 23 May) proclaiming recently that France "does not need foreign talent, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The point is that there is a fair amount of consensus on this issue between the left and the right.
On the right, Jacques Chirac set the tone by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with nearly two million migrant workers", while on the left, Michel Rocard set the tone by explaining that France "cannot take on all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of national territory by a mob of Polish plumbers.
Both sides consider immigrants to be a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act toward immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande merely includes trivia, saying that co-development will solve the 'migration problem'.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally lucrative, but economically it's very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in host countries.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, particularly low-skilled ones, by pressuring them to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are complementary rather than substitute for national workers and mainly work in sectors where there is a lack of employment.
Low skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive influence on the salaries and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows would lead to a long-term increase in real wages of between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, contributing on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income less expenses) of 150,000 euros to the public budget on average over his lifetime.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points he was missing "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but it is also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have thought that for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote as directly as possible.
We know, since Napoleon the Little, that this was a thoughtful thing.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient in itself and can even become an 'instrument of oppression', as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had a twofold revealing effect in this respect: it showed the need for a powerful return to the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be reflected on in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, the Republican soldiers are no longer advancing in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organised according to needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a blank check to the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to make a coup, but a common, full-fledged, calm and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we wouldn't know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that is subject to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, the one that suffers from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that is being humiliated on the international scene.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that is slowly losing sovereignty and with it each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty should take back the helm of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce their debt burden, free themselves from markets and prepare for their future through investment.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level which cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless they lead to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be another madness and would lead us to a new deadlock.
We must take up a new stage in European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
A revolution motivated by interests would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, we must make Europeans.
Contactless cards are becoming more common
The world chip card fair opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an upbeat atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of micro-processor cards (bank cards, SIM phones, etc.), totalling 6 billion units, according to calculations by the Eurosmart office.
The most powerful segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or shopping simply by bringing the card to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the year before!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, the start is more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are in use.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
To get the upper hand, however, banks need to make them available to their customers.
"Two major French banks have committed to systematically extending contactless banking cards to their customers in the future", says Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile phone payments
But it is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, which is essential for making transactions.
"They're falling behind".
"But it should finally experience a real boom next year".
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012", explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Crédit agricole bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to market an offer that will allow its customers to pay contactlessly via their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-held suspicions of links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Algiers already "has the certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that they are cooperating", he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to have come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have restarted the catwalks.
Abducted from a restaurant in Niamey by people linked to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their captors during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the raid, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
The terrorist axis
The study of the calls made points to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers have particularly caught the attention of investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has been in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, for a long time, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we certainly must wait to possess more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys outside financial and intellectual support and is becoming more active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such 'supports' have become increasingly evident in Boko Haram's evolution and rhetoric or in its modes of operation, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices similar in style to those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuja to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long considered the group as a community of enlightened people of little interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict respect for sharia law, while its militants launch into the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administration.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and attacks on police stations increased.
The reaction from Abuja was, as is often the case, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, he claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuja, particularly the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would span from Mauritania to Somalia and Nigeria, is a concern for all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Somali al-Chebabs operate in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making increasingly loud statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The slogans are spreading, often unfounded, about China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the nomination by the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for manipulating their currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that means a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy view, is almost choked by an attitude that "supports" emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the polls, is still inaudible.
Reagan style
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear program.
"If I get elected, I will stop Iran", he boasted.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second highest-ranked candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such matters.
Recently, he urged countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capability", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military to Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with 2008 Republican nominee John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents say Reagan had simple ideas too and that he won the Cold War.
Remember that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of the boys from Iraq and on their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population is rather positive about Obama's national security balance sheet, which killed bin Laden.
From Iraq, he is suspicious of military interventions that generate a sinking.
And by arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
Nord Stream, new gateway for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which links Western Europe directly to Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into operation.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, took part on the shores of the Baltic Sea, amid orchestral music and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that directly links Russia with Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and their Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have together turned the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
The new pipeline will bring 27.5 million cubic metres of additional Russian gas to Western Europe each year via a 1,224 km first tunnel linking the St Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline should be completed by the end of 2012 and will supply a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project looks like a victory.
Poland and the Baltic States had strongly opposed the project.
The Nord Stream will in fact allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding the overland passage through third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: it will be harder for them to influence Russia by threatening to cut off access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
I mean, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of energy Europe, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in making its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large consumers of gas and with increasingly limited reserves, a reality.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically", François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the pipeline, showing how big gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom executives, many in Lubmin, at the gas arrival point.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of steel coated with cement to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It rests on the seabed, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"A hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution", says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to step up measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs as much as 242 Eiffel Towers and is uninterrupted in its entire length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Swedish waters, but the project was abandoned when the Swedes were unwilling to allow a Russian state company to be permanently established at sea off their coast.
"In the event of a breakdown, we will stop the gas flow in less than a minute", says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider leakage unlikely, for they have planned joints that are projected to leak every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the status of the pipeline is ensured by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, which carries out external inspections, as well as by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
In the shape of a cigar, it is inserted into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of ten feet per second, it provides precise data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without any repair.
The gas circulation is ensured simply by pressure.
At the beginning it's 200 bars and at the end it's 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) and Gasunie and GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom subsequently leased all gas transmission capacities to Gazprom for a renewable period of 25 years.
"Gazprom will be paid for the full capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported", says Jens Müller.
The construction of the pipeline was financed by 30% of the shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom alone assumes the risk of the costs.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
A pair of 15 foot high valves form the gas outlet.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million an hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to bring people back to the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as if aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a design notebook, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used, among other things, to cover the benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century, to the current taste", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand manager at Modo Modo.
And he succeeded.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12,7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed, has been far from complete.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer profile, since the notebook attracts businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which started with 12 employees, now has around 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city centre, and has been able to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the boom of e-mail", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a notebook with leopard caps, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, diaries, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
An enviable success: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th Employment Week for the Disabled begins today.
Despite a determined public policy implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is twice the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the general population.
Discouraging?
"No", says Éric Blanchet, managing director of Adapt, the association which organises the Employment Week for the Disabled.
"The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still a great deal to be done".
It should be noted that disabled unemployed people still face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They are usually older: 37% are over 50 (an average of 17%).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% have not completed secondary school and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, longterm unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In other words, there are many issues that make it particularly difficult to return to work and that "are the core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, managing director of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
There are also those that are not mentioned; people's minds move forward, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur association for the Cité noted that managers surveyed have "a low level of knowledge about disabilities", with an "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually disabled".
The result: private enterprises with more than 20 employees are far from the target of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, which date back to 2008, they reach a ratio of 2,6%.
"We are now at around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, managing director of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: the number of establishments 'subject to this contribution', as well as the amounts disbursed, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has put a lot of pressure on companies", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, particularly among large groups".
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 employees have disabled employees in their workforce, compared with 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy"
Ahead of their match against the Blues on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens are delighted with this friendly.
We dare not say that there was any conspiracy between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the podium of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made up.
Five months after his striker's grudge against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for her progress and for being Belgian".
"I want to go forward", the Lille striker replies.
As for the contrast between his performances in his team and in the selection, "it's a set", he has justified.
"I'm in Lille all year round, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
"I have to get in line".
Called up to play Romania on Friday night, considering this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Not to mention the pleasure.
He has been cheering for the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious 1998 and 2000 campaigns.
"I've always been a fan", he says.
This will certainly reinforce the 'special' character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy".
In a simplistic way, Leekens has referred to "pride".
"Pride" for playing "a gala match".
"Proud" also for verifying, as "neighbour", that France "is again a very high-level team", about a year after the Knysna trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job", he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not be attending the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Blues to... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up", he said.
"We're building something; the players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You'll be able to see it in the next games". Including the game against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal are looking forward to their second leg against Bosnia at 22.00 on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes are up, we'll be a happy team and, above all, a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt; the Selecçao, which he has led since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to beat.
Considering the first leg (0-0), on Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the matter is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for over an hour, yes, but they couldn't score the valuable goal that would have given them the peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but it also carries a risk, since we haven't scored away from home".
But at home, in the bright Lisbon Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced they will pass, before an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is clear that the game "is very even", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the game is very evenly matched, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead", said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance of participating in the Euro 2012", has, however, relativised the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it also carries a risk, since we haven't scored outside the home", Bento laments.
"We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the outset to "not give them time to think".
Good idea, as long as, this time, it's realistic.
