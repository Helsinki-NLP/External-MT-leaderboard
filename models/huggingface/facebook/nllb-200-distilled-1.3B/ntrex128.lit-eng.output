Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that it looks like a puppet
Some Assembly Members have objected to the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is in relation to the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that this could be ridiculed at a political level.
A Labour Assembly member said his group was concerned that it was being used to rhyme with Twp and Twp.
For non-Welsh readers: twp means stupid in Welsh, and pwp means something.
The MEP said that the whole group was "dissatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative stated that his group was open to the name change but noted that it was an abbreviation of the word from MWP to le.
For the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English letter u.
The Assembly committee, which is currently drafting legislation to change the name, said: The final decision on the names of all the members of the Assembly will, of course, be up to the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals which received strong support for the Assembly to be called the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the names of the Assembly members, the Commission preferred the Welsh MPs or WMP, but the MWP received the greatest support during the public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are clearly offering alternatives, but efforts to reach an agreement could be a headache for the presiding official, Elin Jones, who is expected to present draft legislation on the amendments in a matter of weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other amendments to the work of the Assembly, including rules on disqualification of Assembly members and a committee structure plan.
During the legislative debate, the members of the Assembly shall have a decisive say on what they should be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
Opposing the referendum on the name change, President Gjorge Ivanov said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
During the Harlem Troubles, the bells of St. Martin's and other churches fell silent
"The older people I spoke to said that historically, you could find a bar and a church on every corner", Adams said.
Today, you can't find either one.
He said it was understandable why the bars were gone.
"People communicate differently these days", he said.
 Bars are no longer a neighborhood site where people gather all the time.
Speaking of churches, he worries that the money from the sale of property won't last as long as the leaders hope, and that sooner or later they'll be back where they started.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with cooperative apartments for people who would not help the nearby temples.
"Most people who buy co-op apartments in these high-rise buildings will be white", he said, "and so they will rush the moment the churches close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these co-op apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations in 1870, before Harlem became a black metropolis in the metropolitan community, and St. Martin's was built a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregation was organized in the 1840's.
The black congregation that organized the nearby service took the name of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main store in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by fire, but since the parishioners of Father Johnson were planning to rebuild it, they ordered a carillon.
The minister David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and the successor of St. Martin's, was proud to call the carillon the poor man's bell.
Experts who called July the carillon have called it   a cultural treasure and  an irreplaceable historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng, a University of Michigan expert, also noted that this was the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who began playing a larger carillon 18 years ago at a Riverside church.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him with another musician.
What's happened over the past few months at St. Martin's has been a complicated story involving architects and contractors, some of whom were recruited by the church's laity, others by the Episcopal Church's diocese.
The governing body of the parish of Zakhrya, made up of lay leaders, expressed concern in July that the diocese would try to pass on the costs of the church even though it had not hired the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
A shark in California injured a 13-year-old lobster catcher
Officials say a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was catching lobster on the opening day of the California lobster season.
He was attacked just before 7:00 a.m. in Ensinitas, near Lighthouse Beach.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he and his friends were diving for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then he came with a group to help him out of the water.
Hammel told me that the boy was excited to catch the lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "It bit me!"
It bit me!
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire wrist was stretched.
And I cried to all the people, and said, Come up out of the water; and there are sharks in the water. And Hammel said,
The boy was flown to San Diego's Rady Children's Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition.
What kind of shark attacked the boy is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago but was determined not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the waist.
Officials have closed the beach from Casablanca Bridge to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to break into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's will take over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, with the department stores' stylish beauty departments staffed by specialist consultants.
Actively entering the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow and fashion and household goods sales are falling, larger beauty departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, more will be set up next year.
Investment in beauty is increasing, and shopping malls are looking for ways to use shelves that were once used for TVs, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's has announced it will double its beauty lineup to 3,000 product names, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweeserman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range will also be given more local brands in areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The mall also re-launched its Boutique makeup range, most of which is vegan  increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop will be testing discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second later this year in Sale Oak, Birmingham.
The trend towards online shopping and the desire to buy small amounts daily from local basic stores means that shopping centres have to do more to attract visitors.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said that branded stores increasingly look like one-stop shops as the chain of malls tries to compete with cheaper Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services than food.
Sainsbury's has added Argos stores to hundreds of stores and has also set up a number of Habitat stores, having bought both chains two years ago, which it says has boosted sales of foodstuffs and made them more profitable to acquire.
The mall's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy department failed.
In the early 1980s, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended in a dispute over how to distribute the revenue from the pharmacy stores in the malls.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's' sale of its 281 stores for £125 million three years ago to the owner of the Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, Céline.
It was argued that Lloyds contributed to this plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's chief commercial officer, said: "We have redesigned the look and feel of our beauty department to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be willing to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and our attractive environment and convenient locations have made us an attractive place of beauty that challenges the old shopping patterns.
Peter Jones is furious that Holly Willoughby has terminated his £11 million contract.
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones has come out of retirement after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Mr. Willoughby no longer has time for their Truly brand of household goods and accessories.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on her Instagram account that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby's last moment to leave the lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV has angered Dragon's Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say Jones was furious when, during a tense meeting on Tuesday, the golden TV girl at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that new deals worth up to £1.5m would mean she would no longer have time to devote to his household goods and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's trademark Goop and was speculated to have doubled Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
After 37-year-old H. Willoughby announced on her Instagram account that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from the UK to one of her summer homes.
A source said that "Truly" has been one of Holly's top priorities up until now.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, spanning the next couple of decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
Marlow Headquarters has a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods.
Experts believe that the departure of The Morning, one of Britain's most financially successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, as well as the delay in starting everything.
And it could be the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three, H. Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, maintained close ties with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for a decade.
In 2016, H. Willoughby and T. Cappu founded Truly, and 52-year-old P. Jones joined the March as chairman.
The couple is on vacation together, and Mr. Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We will not comment on his business dealings".
We had a rough talk and fell in love.
He joked about the media criticism of his comments, which some might consider "unpresidential", and his positive comments about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
In a short, whispered voice, the news anchor said,
I didn't give up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament failed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not getting an appropriate response from the United States over its early disarmament.
He noted that the US is instead continuing sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his speech, the short one expressed a much more optimistic attitude.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have this wonderful relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results, including the end of missile tests, assistance in freeing hostages, and the return of the remains of American soldiers home.
He defended his unusual attitude by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people wanting to get into this crowded arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing right in front of him.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, killing hundreds
Foreign NGOs were informed that their assistance was not needed following the Lombok earthquake.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, this was not declared a national emergency  a prerequisite for international assistance.
'In many cases, unfortunately, it was very clear that international aid was not needed, so it is a bit complicated', said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether staff working abroad will be able to work locally.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute.
Given Indonesia's constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the natural disaster.
Although tsunami shields were built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu likely caused more deaths despite the warning.
Traveling between many of Indonesia's islands is difficult at the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship serving earthquake victims in Lombok is on its way to Palau, but it will not reach the new site for at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made rebuilding Indonesia's destroyed infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, and he has spent generously on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has not given Joko's administration peace of mind, as he will contest elections again next year.
Joko also faces pressure from the lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslims are the majority and hold a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other simple weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores the away goal in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat by scoring a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
With their team trailing 1-0, Xherdan Shaqiri passed the ball about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal to former Sturridge.
He threw the ball on his left foot and hit it toward the long line.
The ball, lifted high above the penalty area, flew into the upper right corner of the net.
He finally flew over the leaping Cape Arrizabalaga and hit the net.
"I was just trying to get in a position to catch the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to keep as much time as possible for the attack", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, I hit the ball with one shot and, without thinking too much, I just jumped.
After a Belgian star Eden Hazard's goal in the 25th minute, Chelsea led 1-0 from the first corner.
In the attack, the Blue's midfield striker returned the ball to Mateo Kovacic with his heel and rushed into Liverpool's midfield.
This one in the middle of the court hit the wall pretty quick.
Then the goalkeepers sent the ball through the opponents to the penalty area to Hazard.
Hazard passed the defenders and passed Liverpool player Alison Becker with a left-footed shot to the net at the far end.
Liverpool will play Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo in Italy at 15.00 on Wednesday in the group stage of the Champions League.
Chelsea are in the UEFA Europa League against Videoton on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll now at 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said earlier on Sunday.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake that caused 20-foot waves.
Palu, a city of more than 380,000, was inundated with rubble.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Berkshire, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. outside of Grayson Mouse on John Street with a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police called in anyone who saw or heard anything in the area.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "It's still early days, but I would like to ask anyone who was near John Street in Berkshire who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have something on the VCR, to contact us because they may have information that is critical to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of the Berkenhead area and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who I think know the woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police reportedly are notifying the victim's next of kin.
A cab driver in Grayson Mouse just tried to get back to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He broke his promise when he found out what happened.
Residents are now being told to wait several hours before being allowed to return home.
A police officer was heard explaining to one man that the entire area was now a crime scene.
The woman was found at the scene of the crime wearing a scarf.
She kept saying, "That's so scary".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were parked outside the fence on the inside, and another van was parked behind it on the outside.
A large number of officers stood inside the fence and watched the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to email @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 on 30 September at 247.
The statues of Parliament in Cromwell are dealt the final blow in a dispute over the rewrite of history.
Removing it would be poetic justice for the Taliban's actions, reminiscent of the destruction of England's cultural and religious heritage by fanatical Cromwellite Puritans.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the statue's relocation, the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster was inevitably going to be the target.
Cromwell did not order or carry out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps it is not the Cromwell who will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Tom in the last century.
Sir William Ham Thorneycroft's magnificent portrait of Cromwell reflects the 19th-century attitude and is part of the historiography of a figure many still consider worthy of reverence.
Mr Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: "For many people, perhaps more so at the end of the 19th century than today, Cromwell was seen as the defender of Parliament from outside pressure, and that, of course, was the monarchy.
Whether this is accurate is still debated by historians.
One thing is clear, the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell became a unique figure representing one side of this divide.
His achievements as a defender of the Lord are also worthy of mention and honor.
A pig killer stabs a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and fatally stabbed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a man named Yuan was found dead, covered in blood from a ruptured artery, lying next to a pig in a Liupanxue market in Guizhou province, southern China.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer in Singhae, Qinghai Province, China, was preparing to inject pigs with vaccines in a pig pen.
He said that he and his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan were planning to go to the markets on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the cousin found the relative dead and found the door to the neighboring pigsty open.
He said the pig had a big, blood-stained mouth.
According to the report, the coroner's report confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms had struck the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and injured", said the cousin, who gave his last name as Wu.
Security footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that scratched the man was neither Yuan's nor his cousin's.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig had to be locked up to prevent it from attacking other people and kept in custody while police gather evidence on the scene.
It is reported that the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating for compensation for the death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, leaving the husband with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer against a tractor and pushed until his wife pulled him away.
After a pig eats a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can be a trigger.
They're just playful.
They're very picky, very curious... not interested in hurting anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly, he said.
Hurricane Rose's remnants will bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken as it moves through cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the coming days, Rosa will bring heavy rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
As of 5 a.m. on Sunday, Rosa was moving at 85 miles per hour as a Category 1 hurricane, and was 400 miles (620 km) southwest of Cape Euchenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a vast area of low pressure is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture, combined with the approaching extreme low pressure area, will bring a broad-based heavy rainfall to the southwest in the coming days.
Instead, two to three inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows, and possible desert landslides.
High tropical humidity will cause some areas, especially southern Nevada and Arizona, to receive between two and three inches [5-8 cm] of rain per hour.
About two inches of rain is expected in the southwest, particularly in large parts of Arizona.
The nature of the patrick tropical rainfall has led to sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions.
When a tropical storm threatens, it would be a particularly bad idea to go into the desert on foot.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers, and overturning can cause wind and dust storms.
The approaching low pressure area will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coast.
More than 1 cm of rainfall is likely, with possible small debris flows and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some heavy rainfall will begin to move into Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and will continue to fall late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah will continue Tuesday and Wednesday.
October will see intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic cools, but it will be quite warm in the tropics.
Sometimes this results in large temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday was a great example of the huge temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, are nearly 80 degrees Fahrenheit [20°C] below those in St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The summer heat should rise again to cover more areas in the next few days.
A warm autumn is expected across much of the central and eastern United States, from the Great Southern Plains to the northeastern regions, with temperatures reaching as high as 90 degrees Fahrenheit [27°C].
New York City is expected to hit 27 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that temperatures in the eastern United States will be higher than the multi-year average in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people watched six televised remarks Thursday from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the 1990s sexual assault allegations against his wife, Christine Blasey Ford.
But the political deadlock continued when the network interrupted regular programming over a last-minute change Friday: an Arizona senator drafted a deal for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, while drunk at a high school party, grabbed her and tried to strip her.
Kavanaugh was angry when he testified that he was absolutely certain it wasn't.
Nielsen reported on Friday that the broadcast was likely watched by more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the average number of viewers who watched the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Furthermore, Nielsen usually has some difficulties in counting people watching television in offices.
To make it clear, this is the same size audience as a football game or the Oscars.
Nelsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, led the network with an average of 5.69 million viewers for the full-day trial.
ABC, with 3.26 million viewers, was second.
 Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC  2.94 million, MSNBC  2.89 million, CNN  2.52 million viewers.
The court case was well-attended.
The main character in Friday's drama was Flack.
After a small Republican bureau announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him as he tried to climb the elevator to the Judiciary Committee.
CNN caught him on live video with his eyes down as people poured over him.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power where so many women have no power".
Flack said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he would have more to say at the Judiciary Committee hearing.
Later, cable and broadcast networks discussed live when the Judiciary Committee voted for Kavanaugh's Senate nomination.
However, Flake said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate within the next week, which the Democratic minority has called for.
Flake, after talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coon, was partly convinced.
After consulting with Coon and several senators, Flack made a decision.
Flack's choice was powerful because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times accused her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining the national interest.
The UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published after her photo on the front page, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson further attacked her so-called Brexit 'Shakespeare' plan for Britain and the EU to levy tariffs on each other, saying it was utterly absurd.
Police have arrested a suspect, Dyton Simpson, in connection with the death of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reports that 20-year-old Dyton Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released video of Sims and Simpson fighting, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS affiliate WAFB reports that police recovered the glasses from the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he fatally shot Wayde.
His lawyer says his bail is $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Medical Examiner's Office released a preliminary report Friday that says cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head, severed from the neck.
The department is honoring the Louisiana State Police's Fugitive Task Force, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police Department and the community for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the district's law enforcement for their brutality and justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-one guy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, the junior averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "blocked and shocked".
"It's all on the brain", Wade said.
A volcano spews ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano erupted and reached the southern outskirts of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Management Center warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday after it recorded 183 gas and ash discharges in 24 hours.
The center has been monitoring a number of landslides and earthquakes.
Photos on social media show the windows of cars covered in a thin layer of ash in areas of Mexico such as Chochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed that the volcano, located 45 miles [72 km] southeast of the capital, increased in activity after a magnitude-7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Don Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Before the independence vote, police clash with Catalan separatists
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's anti-secession vote.
Riot police who were trying to stop the masked separatist group were covered in egg and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds on the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
The police used batons to break up the fighting that began later in the day.
Within hours, pro-independence groups chanting "Unforgettable, Unforgivable" were met by unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain!"
Local media reported that 14 people were being treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but which Catalan separatists have been singing about, tensions remain high in the region seeking independence.
Most voters chose to become independent, but due to the large majority of those who boycotted the vote, voter activity was low.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police across the region tried to stop voting in polling stations.
A pro-independence group set up camp Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to change course.
68-year-old electrician Narcisso Termes, who is participating in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer sure about the prospects of Catalan independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
I watched parents cheer for those who could vote, but now we're stuck", he said.
Despite a vital and hard-won victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to keep pace this year, with many of their most prominent leaders in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Police assistant Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension keeps rising", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
Candidating for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and repression shown by the Spanish government,  he said.
Londonderry, arresting men who broke into the house in a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after re-entering a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at approximately 7:30pm (BVL) on Thursday at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, a teabagging may have been fired at the car.
Mengo's strike ensured Livingston won 1-0 against the Rangers.
Livingston's Dolly Mango's first goal guaranteed the win.
Livingston's promotion to the top flight has surprised Rangers, forcing incumbent manager Steven Gerrard to lose his second of 18 games.
Dolly Mango's shot proved crucial as Gary Holt's team was tied with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's side are unbeaten in the Premier League this season and will face leaders Hearts on Sunday, who they are eight points behind.
Before that, on Thursday, Rangers will play their Europa League home game against Vienna Rapid.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended its unbeaten streak in the division to six, and head coach Holt has yet to taste the loss since he replaced Kenny Miller just last month.
Livingston's losing chances against the Greek visitors
Before Holt scored, his team should have been ahead long ago because of his persistence, which caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
First, Scott Robinson broke through and hit the goal line, then Alan Lithgow slipped past Craig Halkett's head and landed near the goal line.
The owners weren't worried about letting the Rangers play up front because they knew they could get the guests in trouble by creating a standard situation.
That's how the decisive goal was scored.
Rangers missed a free kick and Livingston started to press forward; Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to pass the ball to Mango, who stopped it and scored from the centre of the penalty area.
From that point on, the Rangers held the ball longer, but the home defense was unbeatable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely in the game.
The same run continued in the second inning, although Kelly had to work to block a shot by Alfredo Morelos.
Scott Pittman's shot was blown out of the foot by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and after another standard-position Lithgow shot by Livingston, the ball ran past the goal.
The ball was constantly in the Livingston penalty area during the transfer, but was spat out each time, and two requests for a penalty  one for Halkett's collision with Glenn Middleton, who had run into the field after the substitution, and the other for the hand  of the ball  were not satisfied.
Analysis of the phenomenal occurrence of Livingston
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from the Tony Macaroni arena
A phenomenal game and result for Livingston.
All but one of them were excellent and continued to exceed expectations with the game continuing to improve.
The style of play and the staff have changed little since his return to the top flight, but Holt deserves the credit for setting the team on fire.
He had a lot of heroes behind him.
Captain Halkett played brilliantly, putting together a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they are playing well under Gerrard, they are far from their level this time.
They've had few decisive shots and only one break through the home defense, a bit of a wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was received in Cologne in a variety of ways
On Saturday (September 29), smiles and blue skies were seen as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to try to re-establish relations between NATO allies.
The leaders discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new great mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police banned 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also sought to be heard condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him back into their country.
Various protests show a division among the visitors: some German Turks consider him a hero, while others deride him as a dictator.
A cyclist has died in a car crash in Deptford.
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy Deptford road, southeast of town, at approximately 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped, and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The accident came months after another cyclist was killed in Childers Street after being hit by a hit-and-run driver, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
City police said officers are trying to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Roads are closed and bus routes have been re-routed, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison, six officers injured in riot
The prison authorities reported that six prison officers were injured during a major riot at the maximum security men's prison.
The riot took place at HMP Long Larten Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 0930 GMT, where it is still continuing.
Special Tornado Officers have been called in to contain this riot involving eight inmates and taking place in one wing of the prison.
Officers are being treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison official said: "In an effort to contain the ongoing incident, specially trained prison staff have been called to HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are making sure that those responsible are handed over to the police and, if possible, spend longer in prison.
HMP Long Lartin is home to over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police were called to the prison to deal with a major riot in which some workers were hit with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (this can be beneficial for dry areas)
It's not unusual for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen next week when Hurricane Rosa with its remaining power hits the desert southwest, creating a flash flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flooding warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, spreading into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's expected to approach with rain on Monday night, then head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday.
In Phoenix, the National Weather Service reports that only about 80 tropical cyclones have maintained their tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles [322 km] of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that struck within 40 miles [64 km] of the Arizona border.
Using the latest National Hurricane Center models, it is forecast to drop 18 inches [510 cm] of rain, with some areas of Mogollon Rim, Arizona, receiving as much as 18 inches [5 cm].
Other areas of the desert southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive between 2.5 and 5 centimeters (2.5 and 5 inches) of rain, with up to 10 centimeters (10 inches) of rain in some places.
For people who are not affected by flash floods, the Rose Rain can be a blessing because the region is suffering from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some people may benefit from the rainfall because the southwest is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona is suffering from severe drought, the second highest category reported by weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is moving toward the coast across the entire peninsula of California, which belongs to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 mph [137 km/ hr], was 619 kilometers south of Cape Euchenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles [19 km/ hr].
The storm is facing cooler waters in the Pacific and is therefore serious.
So it's expected to make landfall as a tropical storm on the Mexican coast Monday afternoon or evening.
The rainfall in parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a high risk of flooding.
From the California peninsula to northwestern Sonora, 8 to 15 centimeters of rain are expected, but up to 10 inches of rain is possible, weather.com reported.
Then Rose will move north through Mexico as a tropical storm, then on Tuesday morning, it will reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression, and on Tuesday evening it will move through Arizona into southern Utah.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall on the California peninsula, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods, desert debris flows, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Four people arrested in connection with the attempted murder of a man in the Mid-Summer Norton area.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsamer Norton at approximately 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset Police say a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in the Radstock area overnight.
Officials are calling anyone who may have any footage of the incident on their cell phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered from the Democratic Party's filth, its anger.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said in a speech in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh, during his campaign, "experienced the craziness, the anger of the Democratic Party".
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday in a strong and emotional denial of Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial on his own charges.
On Saturday, the president said that the American people saw that day how cool, noble and brave Kavanaugh was.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a solid reputation in public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made a direct reference to Kavanaugh's candidacy, while also speaking of the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
I'm not participating, although I'm actually participating, he said.
That's why I'm fighting for the great candidates everywhere.
Trump claimed that the Democrats were seeking to "resist and obstruct".
A senior aide to GOP leaders told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination should be Friday at the latest.
Hundreds dead, death toll rising from earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
Authorities reported that at least 384 people were killed, many of them washed up on the beach by huge waves as a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at the Palu Beach Festival on Friday when a 20-foot-high [6 m] wave hit the coast in the dark, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat was raised yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, so they became victims", BNPB Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just break up, it pulled cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that before it hit the coast, the tsunami was moving at 500 miles per hour.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to the centres at 24 Palu.
Aerial photos from the disaster agency showed numerous buildings and shops destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed, and the mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to be shaken by repeated attacks.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (TAPA) said that the energy released by Friday's particularly powerful earthquake was about 200 times that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The tsunami was reportedly strengthened by the city's geographic location at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said that some of the bodies were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, later adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher along the coast, 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Nugroho said communications networks were completely paralyzed, so no information was received from Donggala.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross spokesperson said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were going to the disaster areas.
It was said that this could be considered a tragedy, but that the situation could get worse.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palu, even though officials said the waves came after a tsunami warning was issued.
In a social media meme shared by fans, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building wailing for an impending tsunami to the people below.
Within minutes, the wall of water hits the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami disrupted electricity supply, cutting off communications networks around Palu and making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate aid.
Authorities reported that the military had started sending relief supplies by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still desperately needed food and other essentials.
The airport of the city was reopened for the sole purpose of providing assistance and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has exceeded 800.
This is really bad.
Doseba reported that World Vision staff from Donggala were safely transported to Palu City, where they were housed in a tent in the courtyard of the office, accompanied by destroyed images.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
This is really bad.
Even as relief groups began to take complex action to provide relief, some people complained that experienced foreign aid workers were being denied access to Palu.
The Indonesian authorities have also provided information on the situation of the affected persons and the situation of the affected persons.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster", we can call for international help, but that status has not yet been declared.
On the second night after Friday's Palu earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of the missing hoped that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would change the bleak history of natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled from the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
The coach of Indonesia's national parachute team, Gendon Subandono, had trained two missing parachutists from the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandy, were his students.
"As a senior parachutist, I carry my emotional burden", he said.
Gendon went on to explain how within hours of the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse, it had spread throughout the parachute sports community, sending desperate WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors at the beach festival.
But his messages were only one gray, not two blue crows.
"I think it means that the message was not received", he said.
While filling an ATM, a thief at the Newport on the Levee Entertainment Center stole $26,750.
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, a thief stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling an ATM at the Newport on the Levee Entertainment Center on Friday morning.
"The driver of the car was at the disgusting ATM at the amusement park and ready to add more cash", Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another man ran from behind the Brink's employee and stole the bag of money to replenish.
According to a press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police were unable to determine the number of people involved.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West, the rapper who changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on his Twitter account on Saturday, he wrote: "The person formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time and named his eighth album after the name, which was released in June.
The change began before a performance on Saturday Night Live, where West was expected to introduce his new album Yandhi.
He's replacing singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
It is not just an abbreviation of the current occupational name.
I think ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means tu, as K. West said earlier this year when discussing the album title with Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, that means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and it just became Ye, which means our reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more about who we are.
He's one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brotherly Love.
West's former colleague Jay-Z also changed his name to use it with or without a hyphen and in capital letters.
Mexican politician Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO for short) vows not to use soldiers against civilians.
Mexico's president-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would never use military force to deter Mexicans.
On October 2, 1968, during the beginning of left-wing student movements throughout Latin America, 300 people were killed when military forces opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza.
Lopez Obrador solemnly promised to support young Mexicans by subsidizing students every month and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are drawing young people into criminal groups.
The US should double its funding for AI
"As China becomes more active in AI, the US should double its spending on research in this area", says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI expert who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments come after various US government agencies published reports on AI, even though the US has no official AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China last year unveiled its plan to lead in AI innovation by 2030.
Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the US and the next breakthrough in AI is coming,  Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next big AI breakthrough will be in the US, as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face+.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat America's top player Othello, and later he was head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee acknowledged previous US government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, in an effort to help find more intelligent people.
Lee said that U.S. scientists often have to work hard to win government grants.
"It's not China that's taking academic leaders away, it's companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired brilliant university minds to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its efforts on artificial intelligence.
'I think that doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should be offered green cards automatically,' he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced its New Generation AI Development Plan.
In addition, Lee said, the National Science Foundation of China funds people in academic institutions, similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to U.S. scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced an investment of about $2 billion for the AI Next initiative.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
But nothing has been done in the months since the U.S. legislation to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its aspirations to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour implies claims to Greek territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on the proposed new name, but opponents, nationalists, claim that the name change would harm the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether voter turnout will reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to take effect.
The referendum question on the ballot: Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU if you agree to the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, it is worth the price of joining institutions such as the EU and NATO.
'Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,' said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will hold the results of the vote and make them decisive.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament would be required to change the name.
The State Election Commission reported that as of 1 p.m. there were no reports of violations.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old elector of the capital Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko vote in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name to make way for NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and pulled chairs in front of tents set up by the boycott.
'We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the servants' door,' said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you don't want to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and participate in Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership for Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20 percent, will attract much-needed investment.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", said Zaev after casting his vote.
He said the result would be "to secure our future".
According to the results of a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, the referendum should have a turnout of 3043 percent of voters  less than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian television channel Telma, 57 percent of respondents are preparing to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote "Yes".
For a referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent of the electorate plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first major policy failure of a pro-Western government since it took power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero beats all of Brighton's defence and scores the winning goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's defence and Manchester City won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored in the 65th minute, seemingly with incredible ease.
The Argentine striker got the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before breaking into the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four players wearing green shirts.
He went through one defender before passing several others at the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling's left.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero with a single spin from the penalty area and Aguero hit the ball to the right of the net with his right foot, defeating Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
Aguero has a foot problem, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We said he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We're lucky he scored at that point.
However, it was Sterling who helped the Sky Blues break through to the first team in this Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero was in the depths of Brighton when he got the ball in that attack.
From the left side of the field between the two opponents, he handed the ball to Leroy Sanchez.
Sanchez pushed the ball forward with several spins as Sterling raced to the next swing.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the goal just before he slipped off the field.
On Tuesday, at 12:55pm, City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at the Zinsheim Arena in Rhein-Neckar, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a friendly against the Rockies.
After the National Team was eliminated from the knockout stage, there were no more good reasons to push for a new weight.
Competitive Scherzer hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to stay in the playoffs; in the National League West, they are one point behind the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies, after a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, at least have a shot at a wild card spot, but they still have to work to secure their first division berth.
Even if we're playing for nothing, at least we can run out on the field knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where the crowd and the other team will be, will probably be the highest level we can achieve this year.
Why don't you get dressed?
The Nationals have not yet announced their starting lineup for Sunday's game, but they are clearly inclined to let Scherzer go on this pitch.
Scherzer, who will be 34th in the standings this game, had pitching practice Thursday and will take the position of punter on his regular day off Sunday.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump speaks in West Virginia
In his speech about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.
Everything we have achieved will be weighed in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
It's very, very important, I'm not running... but I'm running, which is why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates", he said.
And then he went on, "You see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see how it's happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see how low it is, how angry.
They don't care what they've hurt, what they've gone through to get power and control; that's what they really want -- power and control, but we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to resist and obstruct.
"And you see this for the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "wicked, nasty, low-minded, unjust people".
He pointed to the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which drew a standing ovation from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, um, like.
No, um... no, I'm waiting for one. That was really bad body language.
Labour has lost its diversity of opinion.
They do not tolerate open expression
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted no confidence in me, I guess it was a surprise.
I am the latest Labour MP to be told I am unwanted for expressing my opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, MP, has faced similar threats because of her strong stance against anti-Semitism.
My distrust was expressed in criticism of me for not meeting Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, on similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that we wanted to get a lot of members involved and that the meetings were productive.
For most of the eight years I was a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were like this.
Sadly, today, the tone of many meetings is not the same, and promises of a softer, kinder policy have long since been forgotten, even if they were ever implemented.
It is increasingly clear that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is assessed on its own merits by the party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became party leader and colleagues, who I thought had similar political views, began to expect me to turn around and take a view that I would never agree with, whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly about anything, no matter what, there are a lot of insults on social media that encourage my dismissal, condemn the policies of the centre and say I don't belong in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I'm far luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things about this political era is how insulting has become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a party of the same opinion, and with each vote of no confidence or change in the electoral system, this party is getting weaker.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years about not jumping around, not talking so loud, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect, which literally destroyed my entire school class, I have sought to win better public services for those who need them most -- whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never been a political secretary, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East should be in any way surprised by my political views and disagreements with current leaders in the area.
To those who pushed this procedure on Friday, I can say that with the country heading towards Brexit, which will affect households, businesses and public services, I have no desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, one message I have for Nottingham Momentum, to my constituents, Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political expediency will deter me from acting in my beliefs and in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
♪ The Irish are invincible ♪ ♪ The Irish are taking the top of the table ♪
Two late attempts distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ireland deserved this moment of triumph in the spectacular, promising match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
Now the team is at the top of the table... the only one unaffected.
In the end, they won because of their impeccable defense and the opportunity they took, so Coach Peter Murchie can really feel good about that.
"We have taken all the challenges in all the matches we have played so far and we are still unbeaten, so I am really happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "It turned out well, the players took their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, which was completed by Frazier Climo, gave the Irish the lead, but a yellow card for Scot Rory Hughes, who was sent off by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to collect a point, and Baggot stopped the unsuccessful attempt.
Climo increased the Irish lead with a penalty after scoring points in the middle of the match and successfully completing the individual challenge, helping the Irish to extend their lead to 17-5 before half-time.
However, Melrose started the second lap well and a try from Patrick Anderson, which Baggott successfully completed, cut the gap to five points.
The match was suspended for a longer period of time due to Ruaridh Knott suffering a serious injury and being carried off the field on a stretcher.
Ireland captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card and Melrose tried to use the excess players, but Bruce Colvine's attempt failed after intense pressure.
The home player returned, but after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Clyme without a ball, MacPherson pressed the ball from the penalty area for the remainder of the Irish fight.
Clima successfully completed his attempt, as he had done almost from the start of the rematch, after Kyle Rowe stopped David Armstrong's pitch into the corner of the court and prevented outfielder Gregor Henry from setting up the home team's fifth attempt to score.
The star of the game seems ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems poised to move into the hospitality and catering industry after it emerged he's been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC sitcom, writing and starring alongside his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the show's final season, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craigslist.
He has officially become a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although sources at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow's booming restaurant business.
We belong to the sea: Bolivia, trapped on land, hopes the court will open its way back to the ocean
The sailors are on patrol at the naval base in La Paz.
The blue flag of the ocean is flying over public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the slogan: "We rightfully own the sea".
It's our duty to get her back.
Trapped all over the land in Bolivia, the memory of the access to the ocean that Chile had to sacrifice in the bloody resource conflict of the 19th century is still alive and well, reawakened in the Pacific Ocean.
Hopes for a peaceful solution, which had been cherished for decades, are now being strengthened as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
'Bolivia is focused on a spirit of unity and peace and of course hopes for positive results', said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the ICC ruling on big screens, hoping that the Hague tribunal will give a positive ruling on Bolivia's appeal  Chile will be forced to negotiate for Bolivia's access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president of Indian origin who faces a controversial re-election bid, is also keenly interested in what happens on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts are inclined to believe that the court's decision in favor of Bolivia is unlikely to be a positive one, and even if it were, little would change.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to draw up a map of Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICC ruling will be published only six months after the last arguments have been heard hardly suggests that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
And even if Bolivia has made some headway, the last four years could have pushed it back.
"This issue of illegal access to the sea was raised by the current Bolivian administration", said Zarate.
She believes any vestiges of Chilean goodwill have been destroyed by Morales' vengeful rhetoric.
Bolivia and Chile will have a conversation at some point, but after all this, it will be very difficult to discuss.
The country has not changed its ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court decision was made unusually quickly.
"On Monday, Bolivia will have a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and end 139 years of disagreement for the benefit of both sides", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, and uses the sea issue as a political manipulation.
'Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,' he added.
A decision is an opportunity to see that we have to make peace with the past.
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will never be the first to give up nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises agreed by the leaders of the rival countries at a meeting in Singapore.
His comments came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be preparing to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting with Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the Utopian dream is that with continued sanctions and the US dropping the declaration of an end to the Korean War, North Korea could one day be overrun.
Washington is reluctant to sign the declaration unless Pyongyang first makes a credible effort to disarm.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is not serious about giving up its arsenal, which it seems to see as its only guarantee of security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The latest trend was revealed at the Paris Fashion Show, and massive headgear is fast taking over the nearest fashion store.
If you want to add to your hat collection or to completely protect yourself from the sun, this trend is for you.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne introduced a wide range of eccentrically sized headgear in their 2019 Spring and Summer collections, and he simply dazzled the Paris Fashion Week audience with his style.
These particularly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and these designers have been putting their eye-catching designs on the podium.
A special feature of Valentine's work was a huge hat of body color with a wide, feather-like border that covered the model's head.
Other non-standard-sized accessories were gem-covered watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even pineapples... but they weren't designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also launched a collection of weird masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were lip-synched and more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of the creatures looked like a nail suit, with a tube and underwater goggles, and the other resembled a melted ice pack.
And if you follow this huge fashion trend, you're not going to ask.
Fashion experts speculate that these giant covers could be in stores.
The giant hats became popular with the high heels of La Bomba, and straw hats with two-legged edges were worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand, which has created very impractical hats that have taken over social media, has launched another huge piece of artwork on the podium - a straw beach bag, almost the size of a swimsuit model.
The red-brick-colored raffia bag, decorated with raffia cutouts and a white leather handle, became an exclusive highlight of the Jacquess collection La Riviera SS19 at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I think next summer we'll see huge hats and beach bags in stores because the designer made such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the need for non-standard accessories".
John Edward: Speaking is a vital skill for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland improved their academic performance records, continuing to do so in 2018, and once again demonstrated outstanding test scores, only further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sport, the arts, music and other community merit.
With a total of over 30 000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen careers and to be global citizens.
Working in the education sector, which can design and implement the school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and are preferred in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you can't talk to a man in a language he understands, he'll understand you mentally.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will speak to his heart.
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exams this year show that languages are at the top of the popularity list and have the best retention rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of foreign language learners received the highest A-grade.
Data collected from 74 schools that are members of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A's in the Mandarin language exam, the highest A's were received by 72 percent of those who studied German, and the highest A's were received by 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland see foreign language learning as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as an elective subject are now considered as important in independent school curricula and elsewhere as core subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 per cent of all reasons for which employers had difficulty filling jobs were insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
As future employment opportunities will be highly dependent on languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career a person chooses in second-language learning, he will have a significant advantage in the future if he has these life-long skills.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will make a person who knows several languages much more competitive.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to engage in conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is so important for children today.
Learning several languages, especially in developing countries, will help children to have better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages used.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be of major importance to the UK in the 2020s, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in an independent school with teaching staff and specialists in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to creating learning environments that prepare children and give them the skills they need for the future.
It is undeniable that in today's global business environment, languages remain vital to the future of a country and that this must be reflected in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and outcomes to young people in Scotland.
It must be done.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
Fans won't have long to wait to see LeBron James kick off the season for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play is still unclear.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48 minutes", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers for six preseason games.
"At this stage in my career, I don't need a preseason game to prepare", he said.
A short speech in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five speeches Trump is scheduled to deliver next week, including stops in friendly areas like Tennessee and Mississippi.
By voting to approve the suspension of his Supreme Court nominee, Trump is seeking to rally support in the upcoming midterm elections as the Republicans face the threat of losing control of Congress in November's vote.
What time is Trump's speech tonight in West Virginia, and how do you watch it online?
A short talk in Willing, West Virginia, scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia online on the YouTube video below.
Trump is likely to touch on this week's topic of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, as she has stirred up a lot of tension over allegations of sexual misconduct after the Senate voted to suspend the nomination for a week while the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the most important goal of this campaign is to help the Republicans gain some strength in the run-up to the November election.
So Trump campaign officials say the goal of the five meetings next week, as reported by Reuters, is to energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to defend and expand their majority in the Senate and House.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the very hot campaign season begins", said a Trump campaign spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
"The speech scheduled for tonight at the West Bank Arena in Wilmington is expected to draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media", reports West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrissey, who is down in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president had to come to push him to the top of the ratings", said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, as reported by Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA is in a war-like mood and hopes to enter Sunday's singles competition
After three individual stages on Saturday afternoon, the foursome may be just what we need for this Ryder Cup tournament.
This kind of luck is completely made up, but players really believe it, especially in contests like this.
So, whose side is it on now?
"They led by six points and now they lead by four, so I guess we can consider it a bit of a success", Jordan Spieth said in preparation for the day.
Of course, Europe are ahead, four points clear and 12 games to go.
The American enthusiasm, Spieth said, has faded, and they're not lacking it, not to mention the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was unbeatable from start to finish and led impeccably.
As the round continued, those wild victory cries grew louder and louder, and in a bid to tie the fourth game, Thomas scored two points out of two.
His punch, which won the match on the 15th hole, was accompanied by similar shouts that seemed to say that the American team was not yet finished.
"You just have to focus and focus on your game", Spieth said.
Now each of these players has to play individually.
18 holes to complete.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undisputed Ryder Cup history.
A strange but charming couple from Europe scored four points out of four and can rest easy.
"Mollywood" was the only couple that didn't need extra hits not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
This development and the reaction of the frenzied spectators only confirms that they will be the players who win on Sunday and that no one else will be able to achieve the popularity of Fleetwood or Molinari, who, with the last rays of the setting sun illuminating the field of Le Golf National, have a chance of securing a European victory.
It would be nice if they were both in different pits at the same time.
Although it is too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played briefly with Sergio Garcia, the Eastern Four-Ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An extra hit and two double extra hits in the first nine holes of the series put the Spanish and Swedes in a bind they never got out of.
But Sunday, no one will get out of trouble.
Four balls and four bats are so interesting to watch because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give and don't give, and because the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe played better as a team, so they came up strongly in the final, but this quarter-final also showed that the U.S. team has a fighting backbone that some, especially in the states, questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will face off on the final day of the Ryder Cup with a heavy lead, 10-6 ahead of the United States after Saturday's quarterfinals.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari continued to heat the atmosphere with two wins over the hard-fought Tiger Woods and a four-point lead at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, determined to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the morning's four-match series against the losing American side to finish the stage 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in the four-way tie, winning two games but failing to overcome the points lead
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12-point game to keep the trophy in their hands.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points when he and Molinari paired up with Molliwood after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in fours, they impeccably crushed the losing Woods and American rookie, Bryson Dechambeau, by an even better score of 5-4.
Woods, who had only had two poor wins on Saturday, had shown a high level of professionalism at times, but he had already lost 19 and 29 of his four matches, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose rested in the morning fours and returned to play with partner Henrik Stenson in the fours; they beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepke, world number one and third respectively, 2-1 in the fours.
That on a pleasant, gently breezy day in southwest Paris, Europe was not going smoothly.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas lifted the American card by winning by two points on Saturday.
In the four-ball match, they won 2-1 against Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter, and in the fourth match, they defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 without hitting a ball into the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team managed to fight back a four-point lead going into a single game, even though Fury's half would have tied enough to keep the trophy.
Although they had been second for two days, their luck seemed to have turned on them on Sunday.
North Korea says it will never unilaterally take up arms,
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen its distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken notable goodwill measures in the past year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we have not received a similar response from the US side", he regretted.
"If we have no confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be the first to unilaterally disarm".
While Ri echoed the complaints of North Korea that Washington had previously heard about opposing a phased approach to nuclear disarmament, whereby North Korea would be rewarded for taking steps in phases, his statement stood out in that he did not completely reject the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first meeting of the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for the demilitarization of the Korean Peninsula and Trump pledged to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US demands nuclear disarmament first and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through violent means, even while abandoning the declaration of an end to war", Ri said.
"To think that sanctions can ensnare us is like chasing utopian dreams for people we don't care about.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim-Trump meeting, which the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months: "If the other side on this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea and not the US, the issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come up so bluntly".
But Ri's tone changed dramatically from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that after President Trump called Kim a missile lord preparing a suicide mission, it was completely inevitable that North Korea would launch a missile at the United States.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courageous steps toward disarmament, but said there was still more work to be done and that sanctions should remain in place as long as North Korea complies with its nuclear disarmament requirements.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable, and said whether it took two years, three years or five months, it didn't matter.
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should retaliate against Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must be steadfastly maintained without any concessions until the full and ultimate nuclear disarmament is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent Pyongyang from financing its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri behind the scenes of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to clear the ground for another meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that all the progress was only to get North Korea to announce within hours that he had made a gangster demand.
North Korea promised to dismantle its missile base and nuclear complex if the United States took appropriate measures.
According to him, Kim said that the appropriate measures he sought included the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and a move to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all of its students to get more sleep in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in the classroom, with caffeine and sleepless nights.
One scholar found that students at the world's best university often lack even basic self-care skills.
Charles C. Ceisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Brigham and Women's Hospital, have developed a course he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for this course came from a talk he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And at the end of my talk, this girl came up to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, my senior year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, will explain to students how good sleep habits are key to achieving academic and athletic performance and improving overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry and executive director of the Harvard Medical School Division of Health Services, said that the university decided to offer the course after it became apparent that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section has a picture of a dorm room where students can click on a coffee cup, curtains, exercise books and books to learn about caffeine, the effects of light, how sleep deprivation affects sports performance and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In the next section, participants learned how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons to encourage participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We understand that this will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health consequences of choosing to smoke", explained Professor Ceisler.
He says that the culture of boasting about staying up late at night still exists, and modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to a growing problem of sleep deprivation.
Ensuring that students get enough quality sleep should be their secret weapon against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even if they don't gain weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, so students feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Ceisler design a course when he attended one of his courses last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye opener and inspired him to apply for a course that was available to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all second-year students to attend the course before they start attending this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set their alarm clock for bedtime as they do for waking up, and that they guard against the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and LEDs, which can throw your circadian rhythm out of balance and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Mengo's goal has Gerrard's men down.
The Rangers suffered another disappointment when Dolly Mengele Livingstone managed to beat Steven Gerrard's weakened 1-0 record.
Ibrox were hoping to win their first league title since a 4-1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as manager and now the latter's side are eight points behind the relegated Premier League leaders Hearts.
Meng scored with seven minutes to go, but the Rangers, without inspiration, saw no chance to tie the score.
Rangers have now dropped to sixth, Livingston have moved up to third and are one goal behind Hibernian.
And that's not the end of the Rangers' concern, because the bullet probably came from the stands and hit the head of sideline judge Calum Spence, injuring him.
Gerrard made four substitutions to overtake Ireland and take them to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt had the same confidence in the nun who took a point off Hearts last week, and he would have liked how his well-thought-out combinations had chained his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but with it, Livingston did more.
They could have hit in the second minute when Meng passed the ball to Scott Pittman, who was coming into Alan McGregor's goal with a close pass, but the safety ruined his shot by driving the ball away from the goal.
After a long free kick by Keegan Jacobs, the ball reached captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate defender Alan Lithgow asked to pass.
The Rangers were in control, but the last third of the game was all hope and no faith in their game.
With 15 minutes to go, Alfredo Morelos thought he had earned a penalty when he faced Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson in the Colombian appeals court threw his hand in the air.
The Rangers were hit only twice in the first inning, but former Ibrox goalie Liam Kelly was hardly intimidated by a blow to the head by Lassane Coulibaly or a mild raise by Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal scored by Liviu in the 34th minute may not have been the match, no one would deny that they earned it for their efforts alone.
The Rangers again failed to overcome the sloppy Jacobs defense.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his own name and passed it to Mango for an easy finish.
During the break, Gerrard moved to replace Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the change paid off almost immediately when the full-back played Morelos, but Kelly's impressive run of the ball sent the shot back.
Livingston has brought the visitors to a game they enjoyed with the long passes of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team was able to increase their lead late, but McGregor defended himself from Jacobs' shot after Lithgow served from the corner.
Rangers player Glenn Middleton, who was substituted, appealed again at the end of the game for a penalty after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and MORE... on this day in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that later led to the invention of the device known as the Geiger counter.
The device has since become a hit in the scientific world and later in popular culture, when the 1950 film Bells of Coronado starred cowboy-like scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What the hell is that?
This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the atoms react, touch the radioactivity in the minerals.
Hey, now it's really shooting!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to spot bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to spot and kill bad cells
The vaccine has trained the immune system to recognize bad cells  this is part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and exchanging them in the laboratory
Then the cells can see the proteins that are present in most cancers and inject them back in.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in the treatment of patients with various cancers.
One woman who received the vaccine, which trains her immune system to recognize malignant cells, had her ovarian cancer gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory, then the cells can see proteins specific to HER2-type cancers and be injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and rectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which immune cells are taken from patients and trained to target cancer cells, has been successfully used to treat leukemia.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
I'm glad it's not over.
After a failed appearance on Saturday Night Live, studio viewers humiliated Kanye West with chants of praise for US President Donald Trump, who said he would participate in the 2020 campaign.
That night, performing the third song, "Ghost Town", wearing a "Make America Great" hat, he continued to denounce the Democrats and voiced support for Trump.
How many times have I had to talk to white people and they said, "How can you like Trump when he's a racist?"
Well, if racism had been a concern, I would have left America a long time ago, he explained.
The SNL show started with a comedy scene in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual misconduct allegations brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was never broadcast, footage of West's replicas was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if the Rock was trying to make fun of West with this tape.
West also complained to the audience that he was having trouble backstage because of his headgear.
They made fun of me backstage.
He said not to go in that hat.
They were mocking me!
They said I hit rock bottom, and he was cheering for the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see what the bottom is?" he asked. "I'm wearing my Superman hat, and that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?"
Start loving each other.
His remarks caused at least two outbursts of dissent in the audience, and members of the SNL broadcast seemed embarrassed, according to Variety.
West was brought in to replace Ariana Grande because her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many with his performance of the song "I Love It" while wearing a Perrier bottle costume.
He was backed by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: Thank you for joining the crowd".
But talk show host Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that West was just being himself, which is incredibly amazing.
But I choose NOT to be with someone (by buying their music or their clothes or by supporting their art) whose beliefs are a toxic ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
But we are also free", she added.
Before the show started, the rapper announced on his Twitter account that he had changed his name and was now officially known as Kanye West.
He was not the first artist to change his name, but followed the same path that had already been taken by Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was originally named Snoop Lion; the music legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.
Charges of attempted murder in a knife attack at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in east Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, this incident happened in Balihakamore.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
"Game of Thrones" star Keith Harington criticizes the distorted view of manhood
Another Harrington became famous as the sword-wielding character John Snow in the HBO fantasy adventure series The Wars of the Roses.
But the 31-year-old actor has been critical of the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on screen often make young boys feel as if they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought something was wrong and raised the question of how to tackle the issue of male bias in the #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married fellow "Game of Thrones" star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that the subject deeply affected him.
"I feel like I'm really touched by this topic right now. Where did we go wrong in building manhood?" he asked.
What are we teaching the men growing up to face these problems?
Another feels that television may be partly responsible for this wave of male-dominated distortions, as it creates very masculine characters.
And he said, What is born, and what is learned?
What is it about the media that makes young people believe that they should be known as such a man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time... how do we change this?
Obviously, we made a mistake with the young men.
In an interview, he also confirmed that he would not be involved in any of the War of the Thrones prequels or sequels when the series ended next summer, and stated that he was tired of battlefields and horses.
Starting in November, Keith will be filming a modern-day version of Sam Shepard's True West, a film about a filmmaker and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him in the making of "Game of Thrones", when he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, the show gave me a future family and a future life", he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series Rose played Igor, the love object of Keith's character, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at a property owned by the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reports a 14% increase in the number of its citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40 000 new cases were reported.
Most new infections in humans have been sexually transmitted, which is different from past statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people living with HIV has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
But over time, the number of HIV and AIDS cases in China has grown to 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a hot topic in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Most cases of the disease occur because of inappropriate protection during such sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as one way to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees leaked the Republican senator's personal information, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the accusations were made by far-right experts and websites.
"Lying, lying and another lousy lie", Waters said on his Twitter account.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information surfaced online Thursday, reported by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill, as the Senate was considering sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little later when these three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address used to identify the source of these records was associated with the Waters office and that information from a member of the Waters staff was disclosed,  reported the Capitol.
"These baseless allegations are completely false and utterly false", Waters continued.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations is not responsible in any way for the leakage of this information.
These unfounded suspicions are completely false and utterly false.
Waters' statement was quickly met with criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial sounds bad", wrote Fleischer.
It says she doesn't have enough of a name to be a congresswoman.
If someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't be defending himself.
He should not doubt the accuser's motives.
He should be calm and humble.
It seems Fleischer was trying to compare Waters' reaction to a Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is campaigning in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"True, if not false", he wrote.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
'We will ensure that the organisers are brought to justice,' she continued, 'that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my staff without exception.'
Comedy John English again hits the spotlight with a spoof of the spy-comedy Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to look for Brexit hints in any British film, and the same seems to be true of the revival of the action spy comedy franchise John English, which began airing in 2003 and returned to the screen in 2011 with the comedy The Resurrection of John English.
Will this sarcastic self-satire about how we've obviously gotten ourselves into trouble become a new national export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his wide eyes and rubber face has a second chance to bring out the unpleasant truths  after all, as the title clearly indicates, this comedy is aimed at non-English-speaking regions of cinema.
Of course, this silly secret agent, who, while he has a claim to luxury, has acquired some of the traits of Inspector Clouseau, some of the traits of Mr. Byne and a hint of the man who was used in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics to create the theme for the drama Chariots of Fire.
It is also loosely based on the character of the traveller and mysterious man causing chaos that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial.
There are some beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English movie.
I loved when John English approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the rotor of the hammer hit his helmet.
Atkinson's comedic talent is obvious, but the humor itself seems out of breath and strangely excessive, especially when serious film brands like 007 and Mission: Impossible boldly incorporate comedy elements.
The humor is as if it were more for children than adults, and I find the adventures of the unlikely John English not as inventive and as practical as Atkinson's silent pranks as Mr. Bean.
The most common theme at the moment is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has successfully hacked into a top-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British spies in the area, causing the agent to be outraged by the overly minor role played by Kevin Eldon.
It's the final straw in the prime minister's cup of pompous, cornered character, who already suffers from crushing political unpopularity: Emma Thompson, portrayed by Theresa May, pushes her best, but there's not much good material in the script.
Her wise advisers inform her that the identities of all her agents have been revealed and that she will have to look for people among the retired.
That means you have to go to Johnny English himself, who is currently the headmaster of a school in some fancy institution, but who is teaching illegal classes on how to be a secret agent.
English is sent back to Whitehall to discuss the emergency and there meets his longtime colleague Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a man who is involved with a submarine captain, and Vicki Pepperdine, playing a high-class girl, seems to be under-used.
So Batman and Robin, who are able to mix up all the things in Her Majesty's Secret Service, go back into action and meet the fatal beauty, Ofelia Buletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
The Prime Minister is dangerously brainwashed by a charismatic billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problem, the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, cause chaos on Walt's luxury yacht, and English begins total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality headphones to get inside Walt's house.
All the stop-motion footage was clearly reserved for this last series, but as cute or wild as it is, it all looks a lot like children's television.
It's pretty mediocre.
As with other films by John English, I couldn't help but think: Is the British film industry not capable of giving Rowan Atkinson a role that is truly worthy of his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan for the British to work four days a week but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party plans to discuss a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company executives to share the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving their employees one day off.
This would allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend and bring home the same amount of pay.
The source says this idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to shift the country's development in a way that is favorable to workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek was also welcomed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is in line with the Party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the overall Party industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea; the Green Party also promised a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this view is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not a party policy and is not discussed in the party".
John McDonnell, a spokesman for the shadow government, used the opportunity to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party conference last week.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless dictators" and "profit hunters" in utilities.
Such schemes by the shadow chancellor also mean that current water company shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour government may deduct some of the damage after seeing the damage done.
It also approved plans to include employees on the company's board and to create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees and enable them to receive up to GBP 500 annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer 60 Minutes' question about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on whether to send him to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the FBI's interpretation of the facts could influence the opinion of some Republican senators to disallow the judge.
In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Pelley asks Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI might find something that will change their minds.
Senator Kennedy seems to be a little more liberal than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Well, yes, of course", Kennedy said.
As I said, on my way to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
And it came to pass, when these accusations were brought, that I called him, and said unto him, What hast thou done?
He answered firmly, firmly, unequivocally.
So it seems that no one would change L. Graham's mind.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and I think it's really shocking", he says.
"I don't know what was going on with Dr Ford, but I do know one thing: Brett flatly denies it", added Mr Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
No one she names can confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything new is coming out.
What is the World Citizens' Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City, the World Citizens Festival is an annual music event featuring an impressive number of stars and pursuing an equally impressive goal: to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens' Festival in Central Park's Great Lawn will draw tens of thousands of people not only to hear from celebrities like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to spread the word about the event's true goal: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival was launched in 2012 as a continuation of the Global Poverty Project  International Mediation Group, which hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete various tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or in some other meaningful way helping to raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But are global citizens achieving this goal? 12 years remain before the deadline.
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really going to get them to demand and call for action? Is this just another example of so-called cliqueism, fictitious activism, where people think they're really going to make a difference by signing an online petition or posting a tweet?
According to the organisers of the Global Citizens' Festival, the movement has recorded more than 19 million actions by its supporters since 2011, promoting a wide range of goals.
They say that under pressure from these actions, world leaders have announced $37 billion in commitments and policies that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group identified 390 commitments and declarations that were triggered by the group's actions, out of which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid or raised.
The Group estimates that almost 649 million people worldwide have already been directly affected by the funds provided.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and practitioners to help children grow and reach their full potential.After receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens, it pledged US$1 million to Rwanda to help tackle the country's malnutrition problem.
'With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and people like you, citizens of the world, we can make social injustice like malnutrition a thing of the past,' said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador for the Power of Food, to a concert crowd in London in April 2018.
The group also reported that after receiving 5,000 requests to improve maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced funding for the 'Power of Nutrition' project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
On his website, he responded to a question from the DUK asking: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The citizens of the world say: 'It's a long and difficult road' and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great human rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will win because we are all stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are just a few of the performers that will be performing at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
According to the Secretary of the Interior, the United States could use the blockade to impede Russian energy exports.
"If necessary, Washington could use the navy to block Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East", said US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
According to Zinke, Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate authorities, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
'I think Russia is intervening in the Middle East because it wants to regulate energy, as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,' said Mr Zinke, 'with the knowledge available.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States can do this with the navy, can keep the sea lanes open and, if necessary, can blockade, to keep their energy from reaching the market", he said.
Zinke told the audience at an event organised by the Consumers Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called the Voice of US Energy Consumers.
He further compared Washington's approach to those used in dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are essentially the same.
"The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is to find a more or less weighty alternative to fuel", he said, also calling Russia a country whose entire economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements came as the Trump administration pursued a mission to increase its LNG exports to Europe and replace Russia in the market, offering a much cheaper option for European consumers.
So Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to back off from the flawed Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that the reason for Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely economic, and that it is an example of unfair competition.
'I think we all agree that energy cannot be a leverage and that consumers must have the choice of suppliers,' said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was met with a hostile reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its determination to continue the project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements in Berlin and Moscow.
'I am absolutely against third-country interference in our energy supply', said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's seriously considering running for president in 2020.
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting at Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to run our failed government, and they need to go to the top", she said at City Hall.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
During a meeting at City Hall, Warren lashed out at President Donald Trump, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about the way Donald Trump is treating our democracy", she said.
Warren is an outspoken critic of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren says the Weeks vote definitely needs an FBI investigation.
But a poll released Thursday shows that a majority of Warren's own state voters believe she should not run for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of likely Massachusetts voters say the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The poll showed that former Governor Deval Patrick has the most support, with 38% supporting his possible candidacy, and 48% opposed.
Other discussions have included the names of prominent Democratic presidential candidates for the 2020 election, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make a formal decision in January, reports The Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks at a rally for Donald Trump about Track Palin's anxiety disorder
Track Palin, 26, joined the army in September and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged Monday night after a domestic violence incident.
"I see what my son is going through, what he's facing as he goes back to his daily life, so I understand other families who are feeling the effects of trauma disorder, and some of the trauma our soldiers are coming back with", she told a gathering at the Donald Trump Assembly in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Mrs. Palin called his arrest the unforgettable truth, and she said that her son and other veterans come back a little changed, they come back with a harder heart, they come back unsure if they're going to be respected for what their fellow soldiers and lackeys and all the other soldiers have given to their country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and assault against a woman, as well as charges of obstructing the reporting of domestic violence while in possession of a weapon and not driving, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support opposition to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed amicus curiae briefs in Washington on Friday to support the challenge of asylum policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, is not to be disclosed.
She says that her partner Che and members of his criminal gang abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which are among the countries with the highest number of asylum applications, as countries plagued by ongoing gang and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that decisions on asylum applications be taken in the light of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition infringes that principle,  the amicus curiae brief states.
The lawyers also argue that the policy of barring immigrants from entering the country is hurting the U.S. economy and that immigrants are more likely to enter the business world and provide needed jobs.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June directed immigration judges to no longer offer asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
Asylum is granted to those who leave their country of residence because of persecution or fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, Mr Sessions said in a policy statement on 11 June.
Asylum has never been a solution to all the problems (or even all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
With the death toll at twice that of Palou, the search for survivors continues.
The situation of the survivors continues to deteriorate.
"The tension is high", says Risa Kusuma, 35, calming her feverish baby son at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
The highway keeps carrying more and more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their flooded belongings, trying to salvage whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the 7.5-magnitude quake damaged hospitals to the point of being uninhabitable.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Hari, with broken backs and shoulders, are lying in the field outside the Palu Military Hospital  as severe re-inflicted blows continue to affect hospital patients being treated outside.
Tears well up in his eyes as he recounts the tremor that hit his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
I didn't have time to save anyone else.
I think I've been through the walls", Harry told The Associated Press, adding that he had come to town with his family for a wedding.
I heard my wife's cry for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they're all right.
US ambassador accuses China of using propaganda to intimidate
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in the US newspaper, extolling the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday mentioned the China Daily's paid supplement to the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, and accused China of trying to influence the November 6 US congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the US election marks another phase in Washington's intensifying campaign to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war, with both sides grappling over tariffs on each other's imports.
The Chinese and US experts claimed that the Chinese countervailing duties were aimed at exporters from Iowa and similar states that supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad  US ambassador to China, former longtime governor of Iowa and a major exporter of agricultural products to China  argued that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad said China is "making itself even more ridiculous" by printing propaganda ads in our free press.
"In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the free speech and press that America respects and commissioned a paid advertisement for the Des Moines Register", wrote Branstad.
"Meanwhile, in the local press kiosk in Beijing, you won't find any conflicting voices and you won't get a true picture of the different opinions that Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, because the press is under the heavy fall of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
Branstad also added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had withdrawn from the offer to publish his article, but did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: As the midterm elections approach, the Kavanaugh fiasco has been thwarted by Republican voters.
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment, the analyst warned that this will be met with a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions are high and many Republicans have already declared their official intention to vote.
These things cannot be taken away later", said Grant Reeher, a professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Mr. Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute calls for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will remember it tomorrow and in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "Fall is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate lobby after Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee voted to nominate Kavanaugh despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, kzip reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be overwhelming, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst for the news website.
People say she was strong enough, and they're right.
But it could also strengthen positions, especially among undecided women voters in the suburbs and voters under the age of 18-29 who, while disliking the president, often simply do not vote.
Even before Ch. B. Ford's public testimony, when she detailed allegations of sexual harassment against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts said that if the Republican nomination was confirmed, it could cause outrage.
"This has caused a lot of confusion in the Republican Party", said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee or the final vote, not just about whether Kavanaugh gets appointed as a judge, but also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they handled Ch.B. Ford", Guy Cecil, director of the Democratic-Electoral Aid Group, Priority USA, told the news channel.
Yet it seems that Americans are still divided on what to believe after the testimony of Kavanaugh and Ford, although she is gaining some support.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents either completely or somewhat believe in the Ch.B. Ford shows, while 35 percent say they completely or somewhat believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh was likely or likely to have lied in his testimony, and only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At the urging of J. Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ch. B. Ford and the testimony of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ch.B. Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her while she was unconscious when she was 17.
Ms. Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party they attended while they were both ninth graders at Yale.
The inventor of the social network plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is creating a new startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The legendary inventor's latest project Inrupt is a company whose work is based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who and what information can be accessed.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt is to take over the world.
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
Solid technology-based app enables people to create their own personal online data store  POD.
It may contain lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all on the same browser at the same time.
The online store for personal data is unique in that only the user decides who and what information can be accessed.
The company calls this "personal data empowerment".
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team disagree with Facebook or Google on changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
We don't ask their permission.
In a report published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that Inrupt's mission is to provide a commercial energy and ecosystem that will help protect the sustainability and quality of the new Solid-based network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the Knowledge Network Consortium at MIT.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a dominant voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even while working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the Knowledge Network Consortium, the Knowledge Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I feel a lot of optimism about this new era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Honored Bernard Vann  Chaplain awarded the Victoria Cross in World War I
The centenary of his birth is being celebrated in his home town by the only Anglican clergyman to have been awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery in the First World War.
Colonel Lieutenant Pastor Bernard Vann earned the award during the attack on Belenglis and Liège on September 29, 1918.
Sadly, four days later, the minister was shot by a sniper, and he was unaware that he had been awarded the highest decoration in the British military.
A memorial stone was unveiled by two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the unveiling of the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat is a remarkably symbolic one.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, a lieutenant colonel led his battalion through the St. Kent Canal in thick smoke, heavy cannon and machine gun fire.
He then rushed to the line of fire and led the line forward with particular gallantry, then single-handedly attacked the cannon and killed three of the group's fighters.
Lieutenant Colonel B. Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something he would never be able to do himself, but they were also something that inspired great humility.
After a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, Michael and his brother Dr. James Vann laid the wreath.
Michael Vann said he was honoured to be part of the parade, adding: 'The courage of a true hero is shown by the support of many people.'
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 but had to settle for Kylie Pepa
Imagine: you stay up all night to see the cookie Bellator 206, but you end up not getting to see the main picture.
The San Jose poster featured 13 matches, six of which were on the main card and broadcast live in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Moussa and Rory MacDonald prepare to fight, UK viewers were surprised to see the video of "Crazy Pepper" off the air.
Some in the audience were not impressed, to put it mildly, because it was this fight that kept them up until dawn.
On Twitter, one of the gangsters called the change of the show from a children's animated film to a sick joke.
Under government regulations, 6am is inappropriate and therefore a children's programme had to be included  Asked about the broadcast, Bellator senior vice-president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, replied.
Yes, the cock-sucking Pep.
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, stated that future efforts will be made to adjust the schedules to reflect viewership in the UK.
"When I think about repeating it, I think maybe we could do it", said Cocker.
But then it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday, and we wouldn't be able to solve it until Sunday our time on Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when we changed the broadcast, there were a lot of messages, not all of them friendly.
We tried to fix the situation, we thought it was a technical error.
But it's not a matter of authority.
I can promise you that won't happen next time.
We're gonna reduce the number of fights to five instead of six as we normally do.
This is a bad situation.
Tom Daley felt insecure about his sexual orientation.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
24 athletes said it was only in elementary school that they realized they weren't like everyone else.
On his first ever appearance on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he claimed he took up public speaking about gay rights because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also said that winning the Olympics was not so important when he became a father.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, has been out of work for several months due to illness.
In the first show, hosted by Larry Laverne, where guests are asked to imagine they are traveling to an uninhabited island, Daley claimed that growing up he felt inferior to everyone else because it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls.
He said, "To this day, that sense of inferiority and otherness has been the driving force that has given me the strength to succeed".
He said he wanted to prove himself worthy of it so that he would not disappoint others when they finally learned of his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and, at this year's Commonwealth Games in Britain, he took the opportunity to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke up because he felt that he was lucky to be able to live an open life without any consequences, and he wanted to share that hope with others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with the man he met in 2013 was unexpected.
Mr. Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to T. Delay, when you go through so much at such a young age - he was only 14 when he competed in his first Olympics, and three years later his father died of cancer - it's hard to meet someone who's the same age but has had the same ups and downs.
When the couple became parents to Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, Daley said his perspective changed completely.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have said that winning the gold medal was my priority", he said.
But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
The son shares the same name as his grandfather, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 of brain cancer.
Antony T. Daley, whose father was unwilling to accept death, one of his last questions was whether he had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, which he was going to watch from the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wasn't going to live long enough to sit in the front row", said Mr Daley.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally recognize that he was not invulnerable", said Mr Daley.
A year later, he competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew it was something I'd dreamed of all my life - jumping into the water in front of the locals at the Olympics - it felt like nothing", he said.
It also inspired the first song choice for Heather Small's Proud, which responded to his feelings in preparation for the Olympics and still pleasantly scratches the skin.

Dr. Mickelson, out of shape, spent Saturday's Ryder Cup on the bench.
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday, his 47th Ryder Cup appearance, but he'll need to improve his form significantly to avoid a miss.
Dr. Mickelson, playing in his 12th appearance in the biennial tournament, was benched by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's quarterfinal.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as he often was in the United States, the five-time major winner spent part of the day on the support team, while the rest of the day he honed his technique on the court to correct the mistakes that hindered play.
Even though he never played very straight at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal player on the crowded grounds of Le Gold National, where long stretches of rough grass are particularly unfavorable for inaccurate strikes.
And as if the course itself wasn't intimidating enough, in Game 9 on Sunday, Dr. Mickelson will play the highly-precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who, along with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, has won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, can get off to a good start in the upcoming 12-point match, Dr. Mickelson's fight could be decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, but he probably couldn't say otherwise.
"He understood his role very well today, he put his hand over my back and said he was ready to play tomorrow", Furyk said.
He does not lack confidence.
He's on the all-time list of greatest athletes and he's given a lot to these teams, both in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't think he'd play two matches.
I was thinking more, but it just came out like this, so we decided to do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.
On Sunday, Dr. Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record to become the most-capped athlete in Ryder Cup history.
It may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, even if it doesn't match his personal best.
Dr. Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk claims that his presence has brought immaterial benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, intelligent, likes to make fun of people and is a great guy to be in the team room with", he explained.
I think the younger players this week were also having fun competing with him, it was good to watch.
He brings a lot more than a game.
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows that a big lead can quickly vanish
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead in the final Ryder Cup standings can easily turn into a tough fight.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where the opposing team led by captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with a score of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"We always remind ourselves that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and we also had a big lead in Valderrama, where we won, but only by a narrow margin", said T. Bjorn (pictured), after watching the 2018 show win 5-3 to 6-10 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow, we'll need all our strength.
Go and do it right.
As long as there are no points on the board, the game is not over.
We have a goal to work hard to win this prize, so we must strive for it.
I've always said I trust the 12 players who are on our side, but we know exactly who's on the other side... the best players in the world.
Satisfied with his players' performance on a challenging pitch, Bjorn added: 'I would not want to be seen by anyone.
Tomorrow's gonna be a whole different hair thing.
Tomorrow's game is all about the individual.
It's great to play with a partner when everything's going well, but when you're on the court alone, your golfing skills are tested.
That's the idea that you have to instill in the players... that tomorrow you're gonna have to squeeze everything out of yourself.
Now I'm gonna have to break up with my partner, and he's gonna have to squeeze everything out of himself.
Unlike T. Bjorn, opponent Jim Fury hopes his players perform better individually than as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who each scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both sides of the final day's surprises, because Brooklyn was on the winning team before Europe kept the Miracle of Medina and turned them into losers.
"I remember every damn word", he replied when asked how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players for the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you're looking for a quick start, like you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When acceleration occurs in one direction, the middle machinery becomes very tense.
We've put our team together and released the players in a way that we can, you know... try to create some kind of magic tomorrow.
Thomas will be tasked with trying to fight back and face Rory McIlroy in a top-level match, with Europeans led by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
"I picked these guys in this particular order because I think they're going to win the whole game", said T. Bjorn about his pick for the singles.
Delivery of new German warship again delayed
The newest frigate in the German Navy was scheduled to enter service in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but local media say it won't be available until at least next year due to failing systems and skyrocketing prices.
According to a military spokesman quoted by Die Zeit, the commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz  main new Baden-Württemberg class frigate  has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was overshadowed by the problems that plagued the ship already delivered.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to be equipped with powerful warheads, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some classified technology, such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic tracking.
Another important feature  longer maintenance intervals, which allow the latest frigates to sail away from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, the continuing delays will cause the state-of-the-art warships, which are said to allow Germany to direct military power overseas, to be obsolete before they are put into service.
The failed F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially declined to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship that has already been delivered to a builder.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German press mentions several major software and technical defects that would have made the ship unreliable on a military mission.
The software deficiencies are particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen, half the size of the older Bremen class frigates.
Furthermore, it turned out that the vessel was far too heavy  this reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Navy to implement various improvements in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project  along with the technical equipment involved, including the training of the crew  is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from an initial €2.2 billion to a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The latest frigate's problems have become particularly significant in the wake of recent warnings that the German navy is declining in power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the navy was indeed facing a shortage of suitable vessels.
The official stated that over time, the problems arose because the old ships were already written off, but there was no way to replace them.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study at a Scottish Highland manor is investigating how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future conservation activities.
In their study, National Trust for Scotland scientists will be monitoring the dwarf, soprano, brown eared and water-faced bats in the gardens of Wester Ross Inverness.
Special recorders will be installed in certain areas of the site to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
The National Health Service staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests with handheld detectors.
Experts will analyse all the audio recordings to determine the frequency of the signals and the activity of one species or another.
A map of the habitats and a report will then be produced to help to form a detailed picture of the behaviour across the landscape.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser at the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management activities such as grassland management and to identify the best way to manage forest areas to ensure that they are suitable for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations have declined in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development, which affect drainage and destroy residential areas.
Windmills and lightning are also a threat, as are mosquitoes, some chemicals used in building materials, and domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, ears are more useful than eyes in catching prey during nighttime hunting.
Bats accurately locate insects or obstacles in their flight path by sophisticated echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes a very responsible view of bats.
Ten trained experts work there, regularly conducting surveys, sewer checks and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The manor's caretaker, David Thompson, says the manor is ideal for them.
"We have a great place for bats in Threave Manor", he said.
We have old buildings, many mature trees, and great places to live.
But we still don't know much about bats, so work here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He stresses that it is essential to check for bats before starting the site management work, as accidental destruction of one litter may kill up to 400 females and young, which could lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats shall be protected and their killing, harassment or disturbing shall be prohibited, as shall the destruction of their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official with the Scottish Bat Foundation, urged the public to help save the bats.
She said: 'We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't know how many native species are doing. '
Ronaldo has denied rape charges. His lawyers are going to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "melagraphic" and claimed that people using his name "want to be famous".
His lawyers are prepared to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorg in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep the matter quiet.
Speaking to 142 million followers in a live Instagram video hours after the allegations were made, the 33-year-old Ronaldo criticized the reports, calling them "melagraphic".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
What they say today is a lie, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner looking into the camera.
They want to be famous using my name.
It's all right.
They want to be famous, say my name... it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man, I'm fine", the athlete added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on charges they called "unacceptable" for publishing allegations about private space.
Judge Christian Schertz stated that the athlete would seek compensation for the moral damage, which would be equivalent to the magnitude of the offence  probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino and Hotel Suites in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Nevada Clark County Court, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete's room, where he allegedly raped her anal.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her that he was a 99% good person who was betrayed by the remaining 1% of his personality.
The documents say Ronaldo admitted the couple had sex, but claimed it was contractual.
Mayorga also claims that she contacted the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but she later agreed to settle out of court because she feared retaliation and public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking a retraction because she continues to feel traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he signed for Italian giants Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: the UK would regret losing its car manufacturers forever
According to Business Secretary Greg Clark, the UK would regret forever losing its position as the world leader in car production after Brexit.
He added that he was concerned about Toyota's UK division's statement to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production at the Burnston plant near Derby would be temporarily suspended.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker argued that the loss of jobs would be caused by border damage in the event of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The Burnston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
"I think if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, we're going to have to shut down our plant", said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota Burnstone.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, also expressed concerns about a no-deal exit and its impact on international trade.
For example, BMW claims that it will close its Mini plant a month after Brexit.
The carmakers say they are most concerned about threats to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota production line operates on demand, with parts for custom cars being delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border, which could delay or miss details, according to the industry.
The Commission established the dumping margin for the cooperating exporting producers on the basis of Eurostat data.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is designed precisely to avoid such checks at the border.
'We need a contract. We want to have the best contract, which, as I say, will not only allow us to enjoy the success of today, but also to seize this opportunity,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Not only Toyota's but also other car manufacturers' data show that the ability to continue to use a very successful supply chain system is essential.
Toyota could not say for how long the production would be halted, but warned that in the long term, the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnston for 24 years and is responsible for the Unite union meetings, said his union members were becoming increasingly worried: 'I have experience that once these jobs are lost, they will never come back.'
A government spokesperson said: We have proposed a clear and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU.
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again.
"As the fight for the Supreme Court justice continues, Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week", the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, Trump aides' ties to Russia, and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney general, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of using the 25th Amendment to remove the president.
Rosenstein denied this report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, following news of his resignation.
Instead, it announced that the meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he would not release Rosenstein, but the meeting was later postponed to coincide with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that included testimony from Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh's allegations within a week, once again delaying a vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "It's not set, it could happen this week, but given all the developments in the Supreme Court, it could be pushed back another week.
But we'll see, I always like to report the news to the press.
Some journalists would disagree: Sanders has not held a single White House press conference since September 10.
Our guide, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders responded that the reason press conferences are rarely held is not because he dislikes TV journalists who seek to influence viewers, but he added: "I have to accept the fact that they seek to influence viewers".
He then hinted that Trump would be more likely to talk directly to the press.
'The President answers questions more often than any previous president,' she said, adding without providing any evidence: 'We have looked at these statistics.'
Sanders said press conferences will be held, but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions of the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this a lot, and you've seen it happen a lot in the last few weeks.
Trump is a regular guest at the White House, public hearings, and press conferences with distinguished guests.
One-person press conferences are rare.
The president's free and sometimes bizarre appearance to reporters in New York this week may have explained why.
The Scottish Health Minister writes to NHS staff from the EU about concerns about Brexit
The Scottish Health Minister has written to NHS staff from the EU expressing her country's gratitude and wishes for them to stay after Brexit.
The letter was sent by Scottish MP Jeane Freeman less than six months before the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in the public service sector entrusted to it.
Mr Freeman wrote: "As the summer wore on, the UK and EU negotiations on withdrawal were moving closer to the expected outcome this autumn.
But the UK government has also started to prepare more quickly for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know you're all very worried right now.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how I value the contribution of all workers, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the healthcare system, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie, who suffered a head injury, underwent emergency surgery
Saturday's game, which the Vanderbilt Commodores lost at 31:27, saw Tennessee State Tigers defenceman Christion Abercrombie undergo emergency surgery after suffering a head injury, reports Tennessee reporter Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just fell down", Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics at Abercrombie's side line gave him oxygen, then put him on stretchers and sent him off for further testing.
Tennessee State Police Officer Chris Harris of the Nashville, Tennessee WSMV said that Abercrombie's surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center was complete.
Harris added that there is no information yet on the type and extent of the injury, and Tennessee State is trying to determine when it occurred.
Officially out of the sport, sophomore Abercrombie has transferred from Illinois and is in his first season with Tennessee State.
Before retiring, he recovered five balls on Saturday, bringing his total to 18 for the season.
Foreign buyers buying UK property will have to pay a higher landmark fee
Under the new Tory plans, foreign buyers buying UK property will have to pay a higher landmark fee and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless
This move will reduce the risk posed by Corbyn's successful campaign to attract young voters.
The increased nominal tax will be levied on UK taxpayers
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers of UK property will be taxed at a higher rate with a flagship tax, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless
By promising more affordable housing and applying it to high-income earners, the move is believed to reduce the risk posed by Jeremy Corbyn's successful campaign to attract young voters.
The increased nominal tax will be levied on UK taxpayers and businesses, and the additional funds raised will be used to promote the Government's campaign to combat homelessness.
The additional charge  payable in addition to the current mark-up charge, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of a second home or rental of a home  may be as high as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this step will raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it harder for first-time home buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad, and many affluent areas of the country, especially the capital, have become ghost towns.
The new strategy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the top-up tax to help more young people buy their first homes.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying up land quickly but not using it, and urged May to address the shame of Britain's housing supply by giving up affordable housing quotas.
Corbyn has announced several eye-catching housing reform proposals, including rent controls and a ban on evictions without fault.
He also wants more power to build new homes to give to the municipal councils.
May said: "Last year I said that as Prime Minister I would seek to restore the British dream, a better life for each new generation.
And that means we need to fix our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not fair that non-UK residents and companies established abroad can buy a home as easily as hardworking UK residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become almost impossible, and the threat of humiliating homelessness remains all too real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to one day be Scotland's manager.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of reviving North-East, currently third in the Premier League and three points behind the top-flight.
After leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got into the B team and that was the end of it, Ross told Scotland's SportsSound on the BBC.
But growing up in Hamden Stadium with my dad watching a lot of Scotland games, it always made me want to come back.
Of course, this opportunity will only come if I manage the club successfully.
Ross has previously been managed by Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, the former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not nervous about working under such famous managers at such a big club.
Now my success will be judged by my answer to the question, can I get this club back into the Premier League?
"The club is definitely a Premier League club, in terms of structure and conditions", he said.
It's not an easy task to get him there, but I think it's only when I get the club back in the league that I'll feel I've done a good job.
Ross' managerial career lasted only three years, before which he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and spent 15 months as assistant manager at Hearts.
He later helped Alloa to relegation to the Third Division and helped St Mirren, who were in danger of relegation, to win the championship the following season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than he has ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"The change must have been radical", he recalls of his leadership at Alloa.
I sincerely believed that I was better suited to lead than to play.
That sounds strange, because I was successful, earning a lot of money, and enjoying satisfying accomplishments.
But playing can be hard.
You have to overcome many problems every week.
And it's not easy now -- the stress and strain of work, but I feel like leadership is exactly what I need.
I've always wanted to lead, and I'm doing it now, and I've always felt like I was in my own corner as an adult, but leadership is the most rewarding thing.
The full interview can be heard on the Sportssound programme on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland at 12pm-1pm UK summer time.
Studies have shown that the best time to have a pint of beer is Saturday at 5:30.
The summer heat wave has boosted the incomes of the UK's struggling brewers but has added to the burden on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that sales of beer and bar groups rose by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of CGA, the business consultancy that compiled the data, said: "The endless sunshine and longer than expected England's World Cup attendance meant that July continued a similar trend to June, when beer sales rose 2.8 percent.
In June, restaurant sales fell by 1.8 percent, and in July the situation worsened.
The main beverage-related beers and bars performed best, with sales rising more than they fell in restaurants.
Although not as bad as the restaurant industry, the main source of income for the beer trade, the food business, was also hit by the heat.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Sales of beverages in well-performing beer and bar establishments rose 6.6 percent this month, while food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman of leisure and leisure sector analysis firm RSM says: 'These results continue the trend seen since the end of April.
For catering establishments, the main factors remain the weather and the impact of major social and sporting events.
True, a 4.8 percent drop in sales over several years will be especially painful, adding to the ongoing cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for businesses, which are mainly food-producing.  Time will tell whether the milder temperatures in August will provide the much-needed respite.
Overall sales growth in beer and restaurants, including newly opened outlets, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the expansion of branded chains.
The UK beer, pub and restaurant sector's recognised sales tracker, The Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyses activity data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion.
One in five children has a social media account hidden from their parents
The study found that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rise in fake Instagram pages
News of the sexual content has raised fears
Twenty percent of the students said they had to show their parents their main account.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create secret social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a sharp rise in fake Instagram pages, which refer to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
News of the sexual content has raised fears
Twenty percent of the students said they used a censored main account to show their parents, but they also had secret accounts.
One mother accidentally stumbled upon a secret Web site for her 13-year-old daughter and found that the teenager was insisting: "Rape me".
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Headmasters' Conference (ISCW) found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11-18 have two accounts, and half of these pupils admitted to having hidden accounts.
MDK's CEO Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidha Doyle will be the athlete's voice at the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidha Doyle was elected as a consultant director at the annual general meeting of the Scottish Sports Council's governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman, and Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for people in sport management to benefit from the range of international experience she has gained over the past decade.
'Eilidha has earned a great deal of respect throughout the Scottish, UK and global sporting community and we have no doubt that her inclusion on the Council will be of great benefit to Scottish sport,' said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I'm very keen to serve as the voice of the athletes and I hope to really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic gold medals in total, now appears as a regular BBC pundit after a brief bout of ischaemia.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if and to what extent I would recover.
I had to work until I was exhausted, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I am doing aerobics!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
An online ad for a breast milk puppy that compares mothers to cows received mixed reviews
The company that produces breastmilk received mixed reviews for its advertising comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what has been described as the world's first silent wearable breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie has released an ironic music video-inspired ad to show the freedom that a new breastplate offers to breastfeeding mothers.
In this crowded cow, four real mothers dance to an audio recording that includes, for example, the words, "Yes, I'm lying, but I can't see any tails", and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't my nails, these are my breasts".
The appendix goes on: "Pull it out, pull it out, I feed my babies with it, pull it out, pull it out, I caress my beauties with it".
However, the advertisement on the company's Facebook page caused an online controversy.
The video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and received several hundred comments, has received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom said it shows a glimpse of the dairy industry's horrors.
The use of cows in this product is a very bad way to advertise.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only to have their babies taken away from them a few days after they are born", wrote one woman.
Elvie's breastplate is hidden in the feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Of course, it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them in the advertising of breast implants for mothers who do not have babies?
Another added: "Advertising is a complete misunderstanding".
Another commentator defended the advert. One woman admitted that she found the song "very funny".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it if I was still feeding.
When I was sucking milk, I felt like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This product is brilliant.
Another commented: 'This is a fun ad for mothers who are weaning (often in the workplace or toilet) and feel like cows.
It is not intended to be a libel or a condemnation of the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they are all dancing with their bra fitted with invisible buttons.
The campaign is based on the insight that many women who have stopped breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pelvis emits no sound, has no wires or tubes, and has an unobtrusive space in the feeding bra  so that women can move around freely, hold babies, or even leave the house while they are weaning.
Mother's partner and creative director Ana Balarin commented: 'Elvie's peanut butter is a revolutionary product that deserves to be marketed in a bold and provocative way.
By comparing the nursing mothers to the dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the challenges of weaning, while also making it fun and as much as possible about the incredible sense of freedom that a new cradle will bring.
ELVIES's dick has made headlines for many years.
During London Fashion Week, designer Martha Jakubowski's collection was demonstrated on a runway by a mother of two using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved into tent camps at the Texas border
The number of people crossing the border remained largely unchanged over the month, but detained migrant children increased significantly  partly because of the Trump administration's tough rhetoric and policies that made it harder to place them with guardians.
Traditionally, most guardians were themselves undocumented immigrants and feared that they would risk staying in the country if they applied for custody.
The risk was further increased when the federal government announced in June that potential guardians and other adult family members would be required to provide fingerprints and share this data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's chief of staff, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for unaccompanied minor custody.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior convictions.
Nearly 80 percent of these persons  their guardians or family members  are living in the country illegally, and most of them are foreign criminals.
"We will continue to persecute these people", said Albenze.
According to shelter workers, in an effort to speed up the processing of children's cases, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some children to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days as was previously the case.
Many will try to defend their claim to legal status before an immigration judge, not by coming in person, but by video conference call.
Those deemed ineligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months, the longer children are held, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Advocates say that this is even more of a concern in large institutions, such as the Tornillo shelter, where the size of the shelter increases the likelihood that signs of a child's struggle will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can add to the trauma many have already experienced.
Syria has ordered the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
In addition, in an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the war in the country's eighth year.
Moualem, who is also acting as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil disguised as fighting terrorism are illegal and will be dealt with accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem claimed that the war on terrorism in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been displaced since 2011, was almost over.
He said that Damascus would not stop fighting this holy battle until we eliminate all terrorist groups and any illegal aliens in all Syrian territories.
There are approximately 2,000 US troops in Syria, who primarily train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions for them to return were good, while accusing some Western countries of spreading unfounded fears that discouraged refugees from returning.
'We have turned to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return,' he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will only receive reconstruction aid if Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has allowed for faster progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement included clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would be destroyed.
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a committee of government and opposition members soon to prepare a draft post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions under which the Syrian Government would participate in the Committee  The work of the group must be limited to the revision of the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why is Trump going to be elected to a second term?
According to this logic, Trump would have been elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers might expect, his presidency ended early in a scandal and rumor.
Without a doubt, that would be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!
So far, no signs of fatigue in the crowd.
Since 2014, CNN's prime time ratings on television have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, while MSNBC The Rachel Maddow Show tops the cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on prime-time news nights.
"It's the fire that draws people in because we don't understand something", says Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Descent", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, the veteran comedy writer and author of The Only Funniest Parts and A Few Uncomfortable Truths About Secretly Getting Into a Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
And he said, "He's making me laugh", Scovell said.
Chaos is valuable because it's fun.
Of course, unlike other television shows, the storylines that come out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the reunification of immigrant families and the state of the global economy.
Not watching is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it's more than enough to inform a citizen when you realize you've spent the last six hours watching a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward uses classified data for his book Fear, Paul Manafort demonstrates a $15,000 ostrich skin jacket (a lot of it inflated with makeup, The Washington Post wrote) and what Stormy Daniels' shocking description of Trump's anatomy means.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"His actions are like reality shows because every night he throws you something about the changing characters of the Trump show and the daily plot twists (involvement in a conflict with the NFL or praise for Kim Jong-un)", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars.

When I contacted Fleiss this week, it was 27 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, and the sun was shining, but he was inside, drowning, taping CNN, watching MSNBC.
He couldn't have broken up... certainly not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing these crazy shows, people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss said.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

The tense midterm election campaign is being funded by the community
Not surprisingly, the reorganization of congressional districts, which ended with two House members trying to win the same seat, brought a flood of money to Pennsylvania's 17th district.
The recently redrawn Pittsburgh suburb has drawn Democratic House of Representatives member Conor Lamb to the race for his seat in a special election last spring he won in another district.
Lamb is competing with fellow Republican House member Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's former 12th district, much of which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties had been rigged in favor of the Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
During the election campaign in the new 17th district, the main party finance institutions  the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC)  clashed over campaign finance.
Lamb rose to prominence in Pennsylvania when he narrowly won the 18th Congressional District in a widely-watched special election in March.
For more than a decade, the seat was held by Republicans, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political scientists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support for China, but then it calmed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, but had not received a substantial negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and owned a hotel in the country before the partners overran the Trump Organization.
"In light of recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan, State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of American diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions are only being considered for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, which would include cuts in financial assistance and visa restrictions for certain individuals, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
During internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar meeting last year that was seen as a major step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials had made clear they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions on El Salvador.
"In a show of the administration's importance to the gathering, Vice President Mike Pence is now on the list of speakers for the conference scheduled for mid-October", diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any report of any reprimand or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the discussion, which was reported by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions only if they remained anonymous.
Their story is backed up by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
Next, we are inevitably looking at a report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice  his very solid evidence is now available in the public archives.
And as we've heard, Mueller's investigation is also about whether the Trump campaign was working in secret with Russia, which corrupted our election.
If Congress were to fall into the wrong hands, Trump would have to take responsibility for this institution at the same time he's preparing to face his constituents again, and perhaps finally the Board of Governors.
There's a lot of "yes" and I'm not saying that Trump's end is inevitable like his European counterparts.
We all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic, and those choices will determine whether the fight goes on long.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler. All they needed was the West to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We got carried away and missed the opportunity to prevent the slaughter that would follow years later.
History revolves around these crucial turning points, when the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or halted.
Now Americans are at some of these crucial turning points.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who is the key to the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein's troubles began when the paper reported that last year an official had offered to secretly videotape the president and questioned his suitability for the job.
Rosenstein claims that the Times story is inaccurate.
What if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or incorrect, or if, despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and false testimony, the candidate is appointed to the Supreme Court?
And finally, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we risk a long winter for democracy.
But the lessons I learned in Prague, I believe we can keep them.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, and she was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had established the house where I had lived as ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light a candle on a swastika table on Shabbat.
With this legacy, how can I be pessimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is looking forward to the Rapid Vienna clash.
On Thursday, the Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna knowing that if they win against the Austrians after an impressive match against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, they could be in a strong position to leave Group G.
A knee injury limited midfielder Graham Dorrance to just two appearances this season in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he hopes the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to bigger goals.
"We were happy with the result because Villarreal is a great team", said the 31-year-old.
We started the game believing we were going to get something, and we ended up getting this.
Maybe we could have been more specific at the end, but overall, the game was not bad.
They probably played better in the first half, but we pulled through in the second and showed who was the better team.
Thursday will be another big night in the Europa League.
I hope we can get the three points, it's going to be a tough game because they've been great in the last few games, but I have no doubt that with the support of the fans, we can go forward and get a good result.
Last year was really tough... and what happened with my injuries, and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a good atmosphere.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying it; the training is great.
I hope we can now just jump ahead, forget about last season and play it right.
This fear of retirement savings is plaguing women with insomnia
Although the respondents clearly had a picture of the kind of care they would like to receive, few talked about it with family members.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member but don't try to talk about it", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's where you start.
If you do not communicate your wishes in advance, you will not prepare your family to care for you.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and what kind of care you would like to receive, as these factors may be important in estimating costs.
You can also get help from a financial adviser to figure out how to pay for these expenses.
You can choose to cover these costs with traditional longterm care insurance, mixed cash value life insurance or with your own property as long as you have money.
Choose legal documents to protect yourself from legal disputes.
Choose a health care authority: Appoint a trusted person to take care of your medical care and to ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the authority to manage your finances.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that the bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
For example, imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is being rushed to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
To be prepared, write down these details on a plan.
"It's not just financial issues that matter.
What kind of medication?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan that too.
Man shot multiple times with an Ilfraco pneumatic rifle
After a night in the city, a man who had gone home was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle.
The victim, aged 40, was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm in Ilfracoum, Oxford, Devon.
The shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m. local time, officials described as an accidental act.
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police are asking for witnesses.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
"At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday", officials said, adding that the death toll was expected to rise.
Due to the destruction of the communications support services, officials were unable to obtain any data from the Donggala Regency  area north of Palu, which is near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the island of Sulawesi.
With a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017, Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency located along the more than 300 km (180 mi) coastline of Sulawesi Island in the northwest.
The regency  in a smaller administrative region than the province  had a population of approximately 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic pillars of the central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, although it is mainly concentrated in Morovalli on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past century.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, a tsunami in western Donggala in 1996 killed nine people.
Located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is routinely shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most significant earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On December 26, 2004, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of Aceh Province, Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
In late March and early April 2005, several strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the nearby island of Nias.
In 2006, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
In 2009, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the area near Padanang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
In 2010, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck the nearby Mentawai Islands in Sumatra, causing a tsunami with waves up to 33 feet [10 m] high that washed away dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
In 2016, a massive earthquake destroyed the Pidija Jaya Regency in Aceh and caused panic as people remembered how everything was destroyed in the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not move, but the collapsing buildings killed over 100 people.
In 2018, strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist-populated island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists on the coast.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
An Alaska police report released Saturday said Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, he took her phone.
According to the KTUU, Palin was returned to the Mat-Su Pre-Trial Detention Facility for a term of imprisonment and released on a $500 bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded not guilty to all charges, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he faces up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspected assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with assault in his home, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin drew criticism from veteran groups for linking her son's violent behavior to his post-traumatic stress disorder from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after a tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the tsunami's impact are being shared on social media.
The tsunami struck the coast as hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek the rare death penalty for a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullah Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, in the rarest sentence for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
On October 31, Saipov, 30, of Home Depot, was allegedly involved in a truck-rented attack on a bike path along the West Side of Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists while driving.
According to a report filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm to justify the death penalty.
According to the court document, both of these charges carry the death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, property theft (usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases), and assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors say the attack was highly planned and premeditated, and say Saipov's conduct was vile, cruel and immoral.
'The following family members and friends were injured, injured and lost their loved ones as a result of the actions of Sayfullo Habibullaevicius Saipov: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernano Ferruccio, Hernano Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucco', the statement of intent states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case that called for the death penalty was tried in the Southern District of New York a decade ago.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last execution was in 1953 in a federal case in New York involving Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted two years earlier of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not repent of his actions immediately after the attack or months later.
According to the police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by Islamic State (ISIS) videos he watched on his phone.
Police said he also asked for the Islamic State flag to be hung in the hospital ward.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federally funded lawyers, said they were clearly disappointed by the prosecutor's decision.
'We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than plead guilty and serve life without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned,' Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to pursue the death penalty.
Tory MP says Brexit negotiations should be the responsibility of Nigel Farage
At a protest at the Tory conference today, Nigel Farage promised to mobilise the national army.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the heat of Euroscepticism and one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would have withdrawn by now if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the difficulties May faces in uniting her divided supporters have been exposed by pro-Remain Tories who have joined a separate protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister has a hard time implementing her Chequers compromise plan when she's under attack from Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostile reaction and force the Eurosceptics and Labour Party to choose her package or chaos.
Bone told a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to thwart Checker's plan.
He argued that Farage should be an equal partner and should be given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we would have left the EU already,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan.'
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight the world wars to obey others.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
'Bone's denied any suggestion that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The view that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely false.'
The pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkins also took part in the demonstrations and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
If the Chequers plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular with our party members and activists who are taking to the streets and, most importantly, voting for us.
You can drop the Checker plan and start listening.
In a critical statement, May added: "Premiers keep their posts when they keep their promises".
Farage' said that the politicians protesting must be made to feel the heat if they are to issue the 2016 referendum decision.
"Now it is a question of trust between us, our people and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, so we're here today to tell them we're not going to get away with it.
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has brought us a Brexit victory, and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
And anti-Brexit protesters marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
When the group was formed this weekend, a group of activists were waving Tories versus Brexit banners.
Labour's Lord Adonis has taunted the Conservatives over the security problems they experienced with the party platform at the start of the conference.
"These are people who say they can put in place IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus plus, frictionless borders and free trade with Ireland", he said.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a public meeting Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November, where she will join Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl as one of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign leaders.
There was speculation that she might run against Trump in 2020.
Since Trump became president, Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoake was her 36th meeting with voters using the public meeting format.
One participant asked if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and fix a broken government, and that it needed a woman to lead it.
Suspect in the LSU Sims shooting arrested
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police said Saturday they have arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At a press conference at 11:00 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department announced that a 20-year-old man, Dyton Simpson, has been arrested.
Police released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man seen in it.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
According to 247sports, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul reported to the media on Saturday that Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of his injuries.
Wayde's defending his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, having a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and was taken to the custody of the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 6-foot-2, 198-pound senior, Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton came close to the world championship title when the team told him to hand the win to Sebastian Vettel
When Walter Bott beat Lewis Hamilton in qualifying on Saturday, it was immediately clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would be crucial in the race.
Starting the race from pole position, Bott had a great start and, defending his position in the first two corners, almost left Hamilton in trouble, prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the two-block garage, leaving Hamilton and he came back into the race in the tail of the pack, so it was decisive.
Mercedes swerved into a two-block garage after the lap and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton burst forward after a near-contact with the unfinished action when the Ferrari driver reluctantly cleared the inside of the track after a double manoeuvre to maintain position in turn three.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back of the grid, but by the end of the first lap he was seventh.
He was the fastest for most of the race, as he drove without changing tyres to be as fast as possible to the finish, pass Kimi Raikkonen and finish fourth.
Finally, on lap 44, he crashed into a two-lane garage, but failed to gain pace for the remaining eight laps and Raikkonen crossed the finish line in the fourth.
Walter had a rough day because he was doing great all weekend, and when he asked me to skip, he was a real gentleman.
The team worked hard and won the first two places", said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a public meeting on Saturday for her persistent denial of a leaked letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were evil, vicious and wrong.
"What could have happened and is actually happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see that people are angry, unwilling, unethical and unjust", he said.
When you see official statements and leaks, and then you say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you out?
Remember her answer to the question, "Did the document leak?"
I'm sure you don't.
I didn't.
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak", he added, impersonating the senator.
Back in July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh that had been leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been leaked from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee, "I did not cover up Dr. Ford's allegations and her story did not leak".
She asked me to keep it a secret, and I did as she asked.
But the president didn't seem to agree with her denial, and he said at a meeting with people on Saturday night, "You know, that was really bad body language.
She may not have leaked, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
In his defense of the Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president claimed that the Democrats were using the accusations to their advantage.
They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the filth, the immorality; they don't care what they hurt or what they have to go through to get power and control", the president was quoted as saying by Media.
The elite league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against the Dundee Giants.
The Dundee Stars have recovered from Friday's Premier League defeat to the Belfast Giants and won Saturday's replay against Dundee by a score of 5:3.
The Giants jumped to an early lead with two field goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were tied before Dwyer took the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard of Dundee's team equalized the score, but two goals from Lucas Lundwald Nielsen later secured the victory.
Adam Keefe's men suffered their third defeat of the season in the Premier League, having previously drawn at Belfast on Friday night and defeated Dundee by a score of 2-1.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams this season, with the Giants winning the previous three.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute (3.35) after Kendall McFaul passed, and with four minutes to go, Beauvillier doubled the lead after a David Rutherford pass.
In a hard-fought game, Sullivan returned the home crowd to the game with a 13-10 lead, and after a pass from Matt Marquardt, Cownie tied the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants went into the first half with a lead, and at the end of the first quarter, he scored his second touchdown of the night.
With the score tied, the hosts regrouped and Bouchard once again tied the score at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen's first-ever Dundee team break through at the end of the second half, and secured the win with a team-leading fifth in the middle of the last quarter.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home next Friday.
A flight attendant died trying to help hundreds of passengers escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero after he died trying to help a plane with several hundred passengers safely take off.
More than 800 people have been killed and scores are still missing after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi on Friday.
The area continued to be devastated by repeated strong earthquakes, leaving many people trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
While his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly volatile control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained at his post to assist in the safe take-off of Batticaloa Air Flight 6321 which was already on the runway.
Then, thinking the control tower was collapsing, he jumped out.
He later died in the hospital.
According to Australia's ABC News, Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We flew him by helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pal.
"This is extremely painful news for us", he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands as the country's disaster risk reduction agency reports that the cities of Dangala, Sigi and Boutongo are difficult to reach.
'The death toll is expected to rise further as many victims are still under the rubble and are not reachable', said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high devastated the city of Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances are bringing in casualties every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
There are robberies in self-service stores everywhere.
Janis Gelfand, head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working to help the survivors, but we don't know what we'll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air News now claims one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
The airline that operated the plane, which crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, although it had previously said all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air New Guinea said it was unaware of a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for the man.
The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for more information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have reported that the plane landed in a lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell from a very low altitude.
"It was very good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to get to the emergency exits in a sinking, waist-deep plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and he himself suffered minor head trauma.
The U.S. Navy reported that its sailors who were working on the nearby dock also helped rescue people who were being carried ashore by inflatable boats before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet [30 m].
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, none of whom were members of Air New Guinea.
The analyst laid out the sequence of events on the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution presented the facts in a retrial Saturday of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman to death in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as a court expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chamber the night she died, contradicting previous statements.
When the records showed his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interview Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford made his case, testifying that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tell was telling the truth about being in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because his truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and addressee information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Haley said.
The defense is expected to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case would be referred to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative perception of the genre by spreading positive messages through their music.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip-hop has moved away from its roots of political messages and focuses on social issues.
They want to go back to the roots of hip-hop and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently been revived in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
A New York nanny sued a couple after being fired for a racist message.
A New York nanny sued a couple for being fired for discrimination after receiving a text message sent to the wrong address from her mother complaining that she was "another black woman".
The couple denies being racist and called the lawsuit "rape".
Mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman was devastated to learn that new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"No, but for one black woman", Mr. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But twice she was sent not to her husband, but to Mr. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman was embarrassed to find out that she had acted recklessly and fired Maurice, claiming that the previous nanny, who was African-American, had done poorly and was hoping to get a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice has sued the couple for severance pay and is seeking to recover as little as $350 a day for six months of living and working at the home of a client she was originally hired for, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple rejected the accusations of racism and argued that it was wise to fire Maurice because they feared they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist, " said the man Joel Plasch to the Post.
Would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so. I was just...
Plats, who had likened the case to rape, said that his wife had given birth to the baby only two months earlier and was in a very difficult situation.
You're going to sue me for this?
This is not a very nice behaviour", added an investment banking specialist.
As the case continues, the media has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers are concerned that readers will not understand the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to feel in another place reading a book for the first time before it's published.
Now it's very interesting to know what we know about Paddington's enormous success.
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book about a teddy bear, would not be too upset if his work was rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication, years after his father's death, was both a joyful and a sad one.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as a very important member of the family, she added that his father was quietly proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man and didn't like to brag", she said.
Because Paddington was so much like himself, he felt like he had a child who had accomplished something: you were proud of him, even though it wasn't really your job.
I think he was similarly impressed by Paddington's success story.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was immortal and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors were unable to save her life.
"Nad kept calling and saying that she was in really bad shape, that she was not expected to survive", said Mr Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad, who called to say she had two minutes to live and I had to say goodbye.
And I said goodbye.
I said to her, "Tashi, honey, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating slowly stopped working and was eliminated from her system.
She died a little early and that was the end of it.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it to myself.
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of his daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of the ordeal she was facing.
"No one knew", she said.
My head was down and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt a great deal of pity for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Postcards from mourning women to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are trying to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are handing out postcards on Wales Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call and ask for help.
P. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any father to feel the way I have to feel every day", she said.
Mr. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile would light up the room.
But he threw it away before he died because it was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother who had committed suicide.
Mr Davis said: "I'm always afraid that a chain reaction may occur".
Davis created the postcards to let people know that there are people around them to reach out to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still, you have to talk.
Mrs Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mr Davies, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, who passed away shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was depressed or depressed or complained", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
At Christmas, things got really bad: When the children wrapped their presents, he didn't look them in the eye and didn't react.
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to get over it: It left a void in their family.
It breaks our hearts.
But we all have to keep living and fighting.

When the FBI began investigating, Brett Kavanaugh's future was on the line.
I thought if we could actually get something he asked for  a limited-term and scope study  maybe we could bring some unity , Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was operating under a tightly-knit supporting cast.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their contradiction is determined only by time.
With just five weeks to go until the November 6 midterm elections, if the Republicans do poorly, as expected, their efforts to elect a man to the nation's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators trying to convince them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, formerly Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get 50 Senate votes to allow Vice President Mike Pence to sever ties and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
With Kim's rise to power, the number of North Korean defectors has declined.
South Korean lawmakers say the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said that 1,127 deserters were identified last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main factors were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the rise in smuggling prices.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Many North Korean deserters are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that were at the heart of a stalemate over nuclear disarmament.
This followed a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when the two agreed in principle to work towards a nuclear-weapon-free zone on the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not changing its sanctions since then.
'If we don't have confidence in the US, we can't have confidence in our national security, and in that situation we will never unilaterally arm ourselves first,' said Mr Rios, speaking at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi finds Brett Kavanaugh a Western and claims he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a "Westerner" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview with the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I just can't help but think that if a woman did this, they would say she was hysterical", Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, when he spoke about his family and high school, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes starting to scream or yell.
He also roundly condemned the former Democrats on the committee, calling him a "grotesque and coordinated reputational wreck" organized by the liberal party, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi claimed that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he had revealed his bias toward the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with his statements and his attack on the Clintons and the Democratic Party", she said.
Asked if she would seek to remove Kavanaugh if his candidacy was confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi objected.
"I'll say this: If he lies to Congress or the FBI, he's not only unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, but on the court he serves on now", Pelosi said.
Mr. Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
During confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time to judge a person hysterically and partially and say 'How wonderful!'", said Ms Pelosi.
The Power Women Should Exercise
It is a legitimate criticism  after months and even years of storing up anger that she cannot express without tears.
"When we're angry, we cry", Miss Stein told me after 45 years.
It doesn't seem unusual to me, does it?
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman, a company executive, who said that she cries when she's angry, but she invented a method: When she's angry and starts crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm actually pissed.
And she just kept crying.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are considered acceptable expressions of anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories is of one of my first jobs in an office that was mostly male, and I once started to cry in an unspeakable rage, and then an older woman, a harsh boss who always scared me a little bit, grabbed me by the tail and pulled me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to beat you.
Democratic congresswoman Patricia Schroeder of Colorado worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught cheating on the Monkey Business in 1987 and withdrew his candidacy, Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why he could not run for president himself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", he laughed to me 30 years later.
 By that time, there were already seven other candidates, so one more was not really needed.
Someone called me Snow White with Seven Fingers.
With a late start to her campaign, she had little time to raise funds, so she vowed not to announce her candidacy until she had raised $2 million.
It was an uneven fight.
She noticed that some of the donors who gave the men $1,000 each gave her only $250.
"Did they think I was getting a discount?" she pondered.
When she gave the speech announcing the formal launch of the campaign, it was so full of emotions -- gratitude to the people who supported her, a system of frustration that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and reach voters directly rather than representatives, and anger about sexism -- that it went overboard.
"You'd think I'd be nervous", recalled Schroeder, recalling the press reaction to her speech.
You'd think I'd be backed by the Kleenex napkin business.
I remember thinking about what would be written on my tombstone.
She was crying?
How the US-China trade cycle can benefit Beijing
The first shots of the U.S.-China trade war have been fired, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the dispute may ultimately benefit Beijing.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most visible opposition came this week when new tariffs came into effect on goods worth up to $200 billion, essentially taxing half of China's exports to the US.
Beijing responded to all the measures with the latest decision to impose tariffs of between five and 10 percent on US goods worth a total of $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight the United States tooth for tooth, and it looks like the world's second-largest market is not going to go down anytime soon.
Washington would only ease sanctions if China complied, but publicly bowing to the US would be too much for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its part properly, the difficulties of the trade war with the US could have a positive impact on China in the long run, as it will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
'The fact that a sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would cause the economies of both countries to collapse is actually much more dangerous than observers have hitherto acknowledged,' said Abigail Grace, a research fellow at the Asia Center for the New American Security.
Syrian Foreign Minister says country ready to welcome returning refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
'The progress made in the fight against terrorism has made the situation in the region much more stable and secure,' he said.
The authorities continue to work to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists and restore normalcy.
All conditions have already been set for the voluntary return of refugees to a country which they have been forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that affect their daily lives and well-being.
The UN estimates that about 5.5 million Syrians have left Syria since the war began in 2011.
The six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the insurgency.
Europe has been swamped by a Ryder Cup victory in Paris.
The European team, defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5:10.5, won the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has lost six straight in Europe and hasn't won the Ryder Cup on the continent since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish-born captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, enough to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who has been struggling throughout the tournament, delivered a shot from the teeing court straight into the water at the end of the 16th hole in the third pair against Francesco Molinari.
Italian F. Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to reach a 5-0-0 record since the tournament took its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5-4 by Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest-ranked European player.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have been playing his last Ryder Cup match.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain became the most successful European player of all time in the tournament, with 25.5 career points.
I cry sometimes, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Mr. Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy that we got the cup back.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He hands the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in Sunday's singles match.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
That's a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was unlucky to hit the grass all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fineau, who demonstrated a high-level game throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard.
There was a moment this morning when we started to press the Europeans.
We fought.
I'm putting my hat on for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to bow your head.
Our opponents were outnumbered.
Red flood news, concentrations are falling in Pineal, Manatee and Sarasota
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) states that overall red tide concentration is declining in Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, more fragmented flowering was observed in Paines, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties  suggesting a decrease in concentration.
The red tide blooms over about 130 miles of coastline from Paines to the north to Lee County to the south.
Flare areas can be found about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but fewer than last week.
Red flooding was also reported in Pasco County.
Last week, concentrations were reported to be average in Paines County and its coastal plain, along the Hillsborough County coastline  low to high, in Manatee County  low to high, in Sarasota County and its coastal plain  low to high, in Charlotte County  low to high, along the Lee County coastline  low to high, and in Collier County  low.
There are still reports of respiratory irritation in Paines, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in northwest Florida in the past week.
