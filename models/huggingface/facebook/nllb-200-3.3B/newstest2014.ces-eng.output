The black box in your car?
As American road designers struggle to find money to repair a crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see the solution in a little black box that easily fits into the dashboard of your car.
Devices that track every mile driven by a motorist and that transmit this information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial effort by Washington and the state planning agencies to revamp the outdated system of financing America's highways.
The usual fashionable design of motorways suddenly sparked intense debate and the formation of various associations.
Libertarians met with environmental groups and lobbied for the government to use these little boxes that would record the kilometers you've driven and maybe even where you're going, and then use that information to compile the tax returns.
The Tea Party is terrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress can't agree to continue, some states are waiting for nothing.
They're looking at how they can move over the next decade to a system where the driver pays for every mile of road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real national emergency.
"It's not a matter of having a lot of choice", said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of State Governments, which plans to start tracking the mileage of every Californian motorist in the state by 2025.
It's going to change the way we pay those taxes.
That's what this technology is for.
The point is that the Road Trust Fund, funded by the taxes Americans pay at gas stations, is bankrupt.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars will go a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn't been raised in 20 years.
With the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by even a single penny.
'A gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,' said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His government recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test this mileage-paying system.
In the long term, this seems to be the most logical alternative, he said.
Experts call it a mileage charge.
Not surprisingly, this idea appeals to urban liberals, since taxes can be used to change drivers' behavior patterns, which can help reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
California designers look to this system to plan strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free-market leaders from the Reason Foundation are also in favor of the idea of drivers paying for miles.
"It's not a tax that disappears into a black hole", said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transportation secretaries who in 2011 urged Congress to move towards pay-per-mile.
The U.S. Senate last year approved a $90 million pilot project that would have involved about 10,000 cars.
The House of Representatives, however, rejected the proposal, due to the concerns of rural legislators representing the population, whose daily life often involves travelling many kilometres to work outside the city.
Still, a number of states and cities are making progress on their own.
The most hotly contested is Oregon, which has 5,000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon be paying the state a mileage tax instead of a gas tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York is currently reviewing the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments, along with the eastern seaboard states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) are studying how they can implement this change.
But there are not all who support this concept.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently fitted with the device, drivers were concerned about the government's ability to track their every move.
"Big Brother-type surveillance concerns and the like were a big problem", said Alauddin Khan, who leads the strategy and traffic management division of the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the pilot project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices".
There is no need to build a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably extend to recording the daily comings and goings of individuals.
Nevada is one of the few states that is trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many miles a vehicle has traveled, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The pursuit of such technology has led some government agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was not originally involved in the scheme to assist the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break into the emerging market of legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they drove.
But this device he's testing is attracting the attention of road network designers because it doesn't use GPS and delivers only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded by a modem.
"People will be more willing to go if you're not tracking their speed and their location", says Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
A number of major errors have been made in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all the people in the state.
Elsewhere, they hope that the thoughtful public will embrace the concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a taxing system that would be equipped to charge parking fees, provide insurance based on mileage, and collect speed data from other drivers so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
Motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them, states the city's project document.
Some transportation planners would like to know, however, if all the talk about pay per mile is not just a giant, secondary problem.
Officials from the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission say that Congress could very easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Road Trust by raising the gas tax.
A one-time or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"No need for radical surgery when you can just take an aspirin", said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislative and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will have concerns about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka is negotiating for the CPSU.
Social democracy is in disarray, populists and grandmasters are talking and planning a common course of action.
If the Social Democrats are able to get their act together in a few weeks, they will sit down with a perfectly matched partnership, who will put on the table a list of demands, including ministerial posts.
The delegates of the CHSSD will either swallow the sour grapes of coalition or they will nod to the shaky minority government.
After four days of being carried by a wave of sympathy, Bohuslav Sobotka has been found for the first time.
Yesterday he failed to control the political bureau and, most importantly, to force the convicted liars to resign.
He's the only one who's been confirmed as party negotiator, and the other team members will only be allowed after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).
I apologized to the guild members and now to the citizens.
You don't lie, in private or in public.
"It was a mistake", said Michal Hašek, the Social Democracy's top official, after the meeting.
He added that he was not fit to be First Vice-President.
"I will inform the UAV of my decision on November 10", Hassek said.
Similarly, the vice-chairman of the ČSSD Zdeněk Škromach and the head of the parliamentary club Jeroným Tejc spoke.
He did point out, however, that he had been elected just two days earlier.
Both MPs then declared that they would do everything to ensure that the 50-member ČSSD club sounded as one.
The theater of the absurd was crowned by Michal Hašek with the sentence: "I have been a member of the CSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party bodies".
So another lie in the live feed.
Or perhaps, in calling for Sobotka's resignation and his removal from the negotiating team, he forgot that the August referendum had decided that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party's candidate for prime minister?
The head of the CSSD, however, by calling the U.S. Army until next Sunday, has made a powerful army of enemies.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of the 192 members of this body and the media with a barrage of gossip and rumors, possibly recalling the real faults of Sobotko's political career.
There will be a lot of laundry to do, and there will be hints of a dark alliance between the carbon-bearing Zdenek Bakalou and the Sobotka wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and influential lawyer Radek Pokorny will be discussed.
There are disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization ČSSD.
The words of Ostrava's mayor and Sobotka's ally Peter Kajnar are cautionary: "I signed Charter 77 so that idiots would not rule the country".
If the S.E.A. had met this weekend, the liars would have been forced to ritually sacrifice their jobs.
The traitors will burn their heads in the ashes and stay.
And the current winning head of the Czech Social Democratic Party will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin on the problems of the OH in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is difficult
A slight smile marks the corners of his mouth, and then he takes a deep breath: "It's hard".
Working with the Sochi 2014 Olympic organizing team is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doktor.
What happened at the last Olympics, we can forget about it.
"Nothing works the same", says the head of the Czech Olympic Mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work more slowly and less accurately.
It's such a confusing situation.
They're relatively quick in terms of invoices, not so fast in terms of delivering information on the essentials.
We've been asking for three months now for the official name of the villages, so we can do a lot of things according to that.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying that this thing is communicating.
They're still communicating on a number of things.
Is the Olympic Village even finished?
But it's not a disaster anymore.
A month ago, we were walking around empty rooms.
The houses are standing.
What do you mean they're empty?
Are there any finished floors?
Just basic concrete, that's what it was like a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that when we arrive there on January 26th as a prelude, there will still be a smell of glue.
And if they don't, what happens?
Do you think President Putin would have ordered an army there?
That's exactly what I think is gonna happen.
I hope it's not the Olympic village = the village of Potemkin.
They're more likely to miss out on, like, road repairs, details.
They may have their roads in such a state that we'll have to bring the London Games rackets.
But I'm sure they'll figure it out.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
There are now about 78, although the number varies depending on the nomination criteria.
Maybe the cross-country skiers will ride in the trio that they're riding.
There's no doubt about the speed wrestler Martina Sáblíková, but otherwise it's in the making.
You still have a trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I'm not supposed to be there until January 26th.
We know what the houses in the Olympic Village will look like.
We even measured some things ourselves by the meter, so we wouldn't believe the sketches.
We're also preparing a whole range of other things, including transportation.
And what does the head of the mission do 100 days before the Olympics?
I'm preparing for the annual evaluation of the individual Olympic sports, plus I'm working on a routine agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Putin promised an eco-Olympics, the plan has him hounding a giant secret dump
Winter sports fans are already a few feet away from the opening of the Sochi Olympics, and others are looking forward with growing concern.
The Russian Olympics, which doesn't start until February, is facing another scandal.
The Russians seem to be failing to live up to their promise that the preparations and staging of the games will not in the least disturb the natural environment in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be heading in four months.
After all, the Russians had a very high bar after the Vancouver Olympics, and the Canadian games went down in Olympic history as the most environmentally friendly.
But it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to "zero waste" games has long since been realized.
AP reporters last week discovered a huge dump of construction materials in the village of Achshty near Sochi.
So, a dump full of construction materials, tires, cans and insulation foam was found in August by environmentalists, who reported it immediately.
The Russian authorities got mad and the dump went missing.
Just for a little while.
Last week, reporters caught a glimpse of a landfill the size of three football fields.
It is not the only one, but several have sprung up in the area, reports Britain's newspaper The Times.
The site is occupied by Russian Railways, a state-owned monopoly, which is building a roughly 60-kilometer road between Sochi's airport and the sports resort.
The company, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was run by one of Putin's closest associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railroad argued that the landfill was built by a subcontractor.
The locals are desperate.
According to the residents of Akshtyra, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village day and night for three months.
Experts say that the local river Mzymta, other streams, and eventually the Black Sea are threatened by the waste.
"The water from here will contaminate Sochi's water sources for the next ten to fifteen years", Vladimir Kimaev of the environmental non-profit EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal dumping is not the only problem facing the Russian organizing committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
By comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing cost $43 billion.
The London Games last year cost only $19 billion and the aforementioned Vancouver Games $9 billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow, there have also been reports of human rights abuses at work on the exhibition of sports venues and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth shut to protest two months of unpaid wages.
Many are also concerned about the way Russian organizers are handling a new law that bans the promotion of homosexuality during the Games.
Some visitors are going to support the gay Russians at the Olympics.
A young couple matures to live with their parents, a new house offers privacy for both generations.
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates was commissioned to design a house on a plot of land that lies on the corner of two streets, with the land itself sloping somewhat.
The request also stated that the house would house two generations who would like to live together, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple needed a small office.
The house is on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping plot.
So the architects decided to place each household on one of the floors of the house.
"In designing the space, we respected the family ties, the history and the memories of the place".
"The three different functions of the house are connected in several ways through the exterior of the object, so that everyone is aware of the presence of others, but still has their own privacy", the designers explain.
The parents' home is like a garden with an old pine tree, with family traditions and memories attached to it.
The different parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, as they differ in the final finish of the façades.
While the main segment of the building is concrete, the surface of which was formed by panels of planks, the part where the office is, is whitewashed and the remaining elements remained in pure concrete without further modifications.
Many of the walls are completely glazed, making the interior of the house very much linked to the exterior.
The parents' home, namely the kitchen, dining room, and living room, is surrounded by a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The connection between the interior and the exterior is emphasised by the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues into the living room.
The kitchen space in a young couple's home.
The young couple enter the house through the main entrance to the hall and then climb the stairs to their rooms.
The stairs are the dominant feature of the house.
Their design allows a great deal of natural light to cascade through them.
That's what the architects were trying to do to differentiate the house and to give it something unique.
The home of the young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen, dining room and living room together.
The only thing separating it from the terrace is a glass wall with sliding doors.
A living area with dining and kitchen areas in a young couple's home.
The second floor is composed of one large open space that freely flows onto a terrace, from which there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The very top floor office is covered in a pure black and white combination.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enters the house through the front door, finds themselves in the foyer, and from there, climb the stairs up.
Defend academic freedom, that goes for Zemana and the ODS.
I have repeatedly called in open letters in recent months for students, teachers and the heads of secondary and higher education in several regions to defend academic freedom against the electoral campaign conducted by President Milos Zeman in schools.
I've met with more or less success.
The rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused to give a lecture by the honorary chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even got revenge in the form of not being invited to the celebration of the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of school representatives who were not so brave and made it possible for Milos Zeman to visit: Technical University in Brno, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, Business School in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kolin, J.E. Purkyn University in Usti nad Labem.
Now, in Pardubice, we're seeing the continuation of the policy of college advocacy.
The newly elected MP for ODS, dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and, moreover, it seems normal to him.
Professor, it's not the same as if you were to remain mayor of a small town.
Do you want to join the CSSD's "Heitman", who are both MP and Heitman, and, like them, are degrading both professions?
Because that's how you tell people that they can do both of these challenging back-to-left functions.
I know, we have an example here of Michael Haas, who can handle dozens of functions at once.
But that's not exactly the type of person you should be following.
We also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Franňková, who preferred to leave the MP post so that she could fully devote herself to the management of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason I recommend you leave the position of Dean is that by combining the two positions you violate the apolitical nature of the academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
The leadership of the Pardubice ODS sees your current tenure in both positions as an asset to the university.
But you can help your school without being a dean.
I think that your students will share the same opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your retreat and save your face.
Otherwise, you might end up with voters counting on you in the next election.
And it doesn't have to be long.
In the Kunovice bubble, the cabbage, the chemicals don't add to it.
More than a thousand tonnes of sauerkraut are to be produced in the coming months in the Slovak town of Frut Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season starts here in October and lasts for about six months.
Since 1925, they have been making this delicious food in the traditional way, by stepping on the big tanks.
In the modern industrial age, it's a rarity.
Our workers walk a six-mile route in shifts.
Each of the ten tanks holds between 15 and 30 tonnes of cabbage, and it takes three shifts to fill one", said the plant's director, David Kladroba.
The heads of cabbage are brought to the company's premises directly from their fields by farmers, mainly from Ostrograd and Breslau.
The Fruit staff then cleans the vegetables, removes the brooms, and throws them into the rotary.
From there, the already chopped cabbage falls into 20-foot-deep pools, where prostitutes in white robes and heels work tirelessly.
They're a way to get rid of the unwanted air.
The last crushed layer of cabbage is covered with a cloth and loaded with water.
"The green currant then matures for six to eight weeks under spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of substances that promote fermentation", emphasized Director Kladroba.
The natural process is similar to home-made, with layers of workers sprinkled with salt and cumin.
After the sprouting, the cabbage travels to the filling line.
It is packed in sacks or jars in a sweet-sour infusion and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
Interest is also being shown in some other countries, such as Britain, Ireland, and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "cooperate" with Germany in the matter of US surveillance.
Edward Snowden, the American intelligence whistleblower, has announced that he is willing to travel to Berlin to present evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander are unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
On Thursday, German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, and discussed the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP handed over to the media in Berlin on Friday, he said: "Despite the demonstrably positive outcome of my efforts, my government continues to treat the opposition as fugitives and to try to criminalise political speech with heavy-handed prosecutions that leave no room for defence".
But it's not a crime to tell the truth.
In that letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the United States government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible".
Tensions between the US and Germany began to rise after allegations surfaced that the NSA had been tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads the parliamentary panel overseeing intelligence, said that if there was any chance of hearing Mr. Snowden as a witness "without putting him in danger and completely destroying relations with the U.S"., it should be done.
Mr. Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a picture of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contract lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he ever left.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, said the member of parliament.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
But he said the world's reaction to his political outburst gave him courage.
Citizens around the world and senior officials - including those in the United States - have assessed the revelation of an unjustifiable system of omnipresent surveillance as a public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved.
We are sorry for the killing, but we are innocent, Khmer Rouge representatives say
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is a former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge, which from 1975 to 1979 relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism, more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population, died from exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture, and execution.
This commander of the notorious S-21 prison was sentenced to life imprisonment by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charged with genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by saying that they believed they were acting in the best interests of the nation and had no idea of the true extent of the killings.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and then intervened and corrected the situation", Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is, I didn't have any authority", he added.
Nuon Chea stated that he never ordered Khmer Rouge cadres to "abuse or kill people, to deprive them of food, or commit genocide".
But he did admit to "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, the victims, their families, all the Cambodian people", he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives during the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Chea's apology".
"He lied to us".
"He just wants to be absolved".
"He doesn't care about the other", she said.
"If he had not given orders, his subordinates would not have been killed", she added, calling the Khmer Rouge leaders "worse than monsters".
Before the trial, the Khmer Rouge regime's "Foreign Minister" Ieng Sary, who died in March this year, was also on trial.
His wife Ieng Thirith, then the Minister of Social Affairs, was found incompetent to stand trial in September 2012 due to dementia.
Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge for carry-on baggage .
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for storing hand luggage on board its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though in their announcement on Wednesday, they said passengers would be able to keep a whole can.
The new hand baggage charge applies to baggage in the upper storage area, so small baggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if the paying passengers wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee was meant to encourage travelers to make advance payments.
"We would not like to charge this fee", she said.
The airlines started charging for first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and crammed into the carry-on bags hidden in the hold as much as possible, so that the hold was often empty.
Tolls are one way to teach passengers to take less stuff on board.
O'Malley said the point of this new fee is not really to get more money.
The thing is, Frontier's most loyal customers have made it abundantly clear that finding a place in the upper storage area is getting harder and harder.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline's website will not be charged.
This means that one passenger in the Frontier line can bring in baggage for which he pays nothing, while the other passenger in the line pays $100 for the same baggage.
O'Malley said the website and check-in procedures will be modified to ensure that passengers are informed of the fee before they arrive at the gate.
The new Frontier hand baggage charge will not come into effect until the summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other fees, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who request the service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the additional baggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
But most of them didn't cover the hand baggage fees.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost airline, Allegiant Air, followed suit later.
The only company that also has such charges is Hungary's Wizz Air, says aviation consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks the additional charges.
In its December 2011 report, it estimated that Spirit's hand luggage charge would generate USD 50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew on Spirit and was amazed by what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered Spirit's unusual hand luggage charge.
"Getting on the plane was the most gaseous thing I've ever seen in my flying career", he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and fighting at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, and the boarding was in a flash.
Frontier will also charge for coffee, tea, soda and juice, following the Spirit model.
Frontier said passengers who get a soda or juice can keep the whole can and coffee will be added for free.
Water will continue to be provided free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to introduce a beverage charge in 2008, but after complaints from passengers, it backed down seven months later and no other major airline followed suit.
The Commission considers that the aid is compatible with the internal market on the basis of Article 107 (3) (c) of the Treaty.
Airlines pay internet travel retailers like Orbitz between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines incentives to lead passengers to buy directly from them instead of through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier did not go further in this respect.
In September, it began giving customers who bought through an online travel agency only half a mile as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the mileage to 25 percent of the mileage.
So a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased through an online travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home city of Denver, but its business is starting to shrink and it's losing money.
According to the financial results released Wednesday by its corporate partner Republic Airways Holdings , revenues fell by 9 percent and transport capacity fell by almost 13 percent in the first quarter .
Republic is trying to sell this airline to solve Frontier's financial problems.
The NSA doesn't blame the hackers for the website's downfall, but an "internal error"
The secretive National Security Agency said last Friday that its website was down for a few hours last week due to an internal bug, not a hacker attack, as some on the Internet have claimed.
The NSA.gov website was down for several hours tonight due to an internal bug that occurred during a routine update, the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be resolved during the course of the evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by a DDoS attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server scanners recorded that the NSA's website was down for at least six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible to some users.
Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the agency's internal sensitive networks were "not at all" compromised.
A spokesman said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hacktivists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for taking down NSA websites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the targeted website with information until the servers overload and the site crashes.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret agency, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has become the focus of public attention and scathing criticism in recent months after a string of revelations of foreign and domestic surveillance programs - all the product of the NSA's theft of secret files from the agency and their disclosure by disgruntled former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has fueled earlier speculation that today's crash was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier's profit fell as a result of the decline in deliveries and orders.
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, due to lower orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not disclose any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer any up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft will meet its ambitious plan to begin commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft has only flown three times, and the question arises whether the testing phase is progressing well.
The results were not what they were predicted, and the Toronto Stock Exchange dropped 8 percent.
The central bank's analyst Cameron Doerksen downgraded the rating from "higher profitability" to "performance" on Thursday, expecting the stock market to experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
'While we generally expected smaller deliveries of aircraft, the profit margins in the transport sector have been very disappointing,' Doerksen said in a note to clients.
As the pilot program continues, we believe Bombardier will be able to secure new orders for the CSeries.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect market scepticism about the programme to increase.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries will tap into the bottom end of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and after several months of delays, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for the CSeries aircraft is a modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company's claims regarding the low fuel consumption and cost savings of this transport aircraft.
At present, there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
The executive director Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 firm orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
Executives also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was proceeding as planned.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected", Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's hiatus.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the upgrade, and that's what we did.
That's going to happen during the entire flight program.
According to Bombardier, two of the five test aircraft are expected to take off in the coming weeks, with the others shortly afterwards.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the CSeries aircraft was sold to a customer in the Union.
The Commission notes that the airport services agreement concluded between the airlines and the airport operator was not in line with the MEO test.
This slow pace of flight testing  despite being in line with Bombardier's internal plan  will likely reinforce our view that the start-up will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015, Doerksen said.
Bombardier's net profit fell from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, in the previous year to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ended September 30.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover decreased marginally from USD 4,2 billion to USD 4,1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters' IBES system, analysts had been expecting a 10 cents per share return and a turnover of $4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered only 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier.
Net orders dropped from 83 planes to 26.
Unfulfilled orders in the aviation division were $32.9 billion as of September 30, and that's still the same as of December 31.
'The results in aviation were in line with our expectations, but the low order intake and the overall market situation disappointed us,' said Beaudoin.
Airline revenue dropped 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said that revenue in this division rose by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled orders in transport accounted for 32.6 billion as of 30 September, a marginal increase compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by the problems with the execution of several large contracts.
Executives said new views would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google's chief financial officer, Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 on Thursday afternoon.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, announced a 10% drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned the mob about police investigation is in jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, was supposed to be the informant for the underworld king, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was worried that his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top lawyer who informed a drug kingpin about a major police investigation because he was afraid his drug addiction would be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was suspected of using cocaine, and was known to pass sensitive information to underworld boss Neil Scarbrough in connection with the investigation into his drug-smuggling activities.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" (party) and hailed by the criminal establishment as the best lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police tracked Scarborough, whom he had represented in previous narcotics proceedings.
Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at the home of a solicitor in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was having dinner with his Law Society colleagues.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a regular user of class A drugs.
During an eight-month period from January to August 2011, he quietly sought information on the arrests of two men for the benefit of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being pursued at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After a series of raids, police seized heroin and cocaine worth about GBP 1.5 million, along with GBP 200,000 in cash, 32 others ended up in jail with them.
Ditta, 42, has been passing information to criminals for fear of exposing his cocaine addiction.
Ditta, who works for Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, had a shameful moment today in Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
During an earlier hearing, he admitted to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's downfall came after a police investigation into Scarborough revealed that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded him arriving at Ditt's house and spotted him placing 60 percent pure drugs under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Scarborough then had a regular phone conversation with Ditta, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers' football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer went back to the house where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two people.
It was stated in court that traces of Class A drugs were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine, saying he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation fell under "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but all of them were intercepted and hair samples were taken.
During police questioning, he said that he ran an office at both his home address and his workplace, and that clients would visit him at home for work.
But the court heard that after the key arrests, he contacted key players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to share what detectives knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: "Who is more aware of the right not to break the law than a criminal lawyer?"
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer and of getting too close to a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just with the drug dealer, but the drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were no doubt legitimate, because he was his lawyer.
But it went way beyond the usual attorney-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activity.
Mr. Ditta has not brought his profession a good name, but rather a disgrace.
He's become too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he's allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied the offense and stated, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to pass information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately".
But after the hearing, Inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: 'Mr Ditta went from being a criminal lawyer to a criminal himself when he started to obtain drugs from organised crime.'
His cocaine addiction made him hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the designs of the top leaders of organized crime groups who tasked him with gathering valuable intelligence on police investigations.
Lawyers must uphold the highest standards of integrity and must inspire the public's trust and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit has conducted an investigation into Mr Ditt, which has resulted in convictions for three counts of cocaine possession and now for obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five involved in the trafficking were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta himself conducted an online interview in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death row in America, as a dinner guest he would have liked to have seen Muhammad Ali, and as a motivation for the job he cited inequality.
He's been negotiating with Klaus and Spidey for the government.
Now the populists have sent Jan Kasala against Babiš.
The LDP won 14 seats, only one third of the Social Democrats or ANO representatives.
But they enter the government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In the team that has already begun to discuss the outline of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasala - the man who negotiated the terms of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006 for the people.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babiš have such a matador in their party.
I think this time it'll be reminiscent of the first negotiation in 1992, when the ODS was also a brand new party.
"The experience was minimal", Kasal predicts, as this year's interviews will evolve.
Kenya's press outraged by controversial media law
'It is a scary report and it is right to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply undermining the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,' said the newspaper, which considers the bill unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it", said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most notorious independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal would always be biased because it was an extension of the government's hand and that the restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs", he said.
According to the Star, the bill effectively hands over control of the media to the government, and the Standard newspaper says that democracy and freedom of speech have been hit hard in Kenya, criticizing the bill as "rigid".
The passage of the bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the immediate aftermath of the September attack by an Islamist gunman at the Westgate Mall.
The authorities' anger was turned on itself by Kenyan media, which broadcast security camera footage of soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly robbing a luxury goods store.
The police chief responded by summoning two journalists and a senior media worker for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
Under the new draft law, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, with the risk of being "de-listed" or denied official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to seize the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "a single fine is enough to wipe out most radio stations".
It is also said that these measures may have a knock-on effect on the so-called Kenyan "vibrant blogosphere".
Politicians know that if they shut the media down, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
You never know what might happen, wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing Kenyan media as a key resource of a system of checks and balances in public life.
"If left to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back to hunting and gathering", he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to repeal the cuts ordered by the National Wage Agency and to restore their fat wages of around 532,000 tax-free shillings a month, among the highest in the world.
You have to save, young Czechs know.
But most of them have no idea what the interest is.
More and more Czechs are putting their money away.
Still, they're not quite as good as the champions of regional saving.
Austrians save the most, with an average of $181 a month.
People in Slovakia are saving a little more than Czechs.
This is according to a survey by Erste Savings Barometer in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the budgeters is improving, with two thirds of those surveyed planning to set aside more money.
While the Czechs are about in the middle of the pack, in Romania and Serbia, the people saving products are still using very little.
For example, a survey showed that almost one in two Serbs save money "under the pillow" at home.
In Germany, the number of people who save more money each month has increased this year.
Last year, 26 percent of respondents set aside between 1,000 and 2,500 crowns each month for various types of savings, and this year, that number has increased by five percent.
The average monthly savings, however, decreased slightly year-on-year to CZK 2078 (EUR 2,078).
The biggest hit among savings products is the pension supplement.
This is the preferred method for 54% of Czechs, whereas three years ago it was the preferred method for evaluating savings for only 36% of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is decreasing, and the interest in investment funds has also decreased significantly compared to last year.
Only 16 percent of respondents use them, compared with almost a quarter last year.
The survey also revealed that although people believe it is important to save, most of them do not know what returns they are getting on each product.
Especially young people under 30 don't know how much their money is worth.
The oldest group of people, on the other hand, have the best knowledge of the return on their investment, with 73% of those over 50.
In an international comparison of the Erste Group, Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
Slovaks and Austrians are second with a 12% margin.
UN celebrates new goals to fight poverty
The United Nations is starting work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which kicked off overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats were instrumental in pushing for the Sustainable Development Goals to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They've been included in the final draft of a document that will be approved by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit last night that now was the time to "rise above national interests".
I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process of introducing the SDGs, he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realise our vision of sustainable development goals, which builds on the success of the MDGs.
Concerns about Mozambique's security are growing due to a conflict of strong personalities.
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the statue of Samora Machela, the founding president of Mozambique, to chant slogans of peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability", said Vanessa de Sousa, the chief executive of the investment company.
Fearing for her country's future, she exchanged her business attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo's side, one of the worst skirmishes since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, backed initially by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa in an effort to destabilize that country's independent government.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to re-ignite open conflict, but recent events have scared foreign investors and locals.
At stake is a fast-growing economy, as the discovery of vast offshore oil reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in over $50 billion in investments over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy, and Anadarko of the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.
The Renamo Party claims that the government has provoked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional stronghold of the Renamo Party, on September 17.
The violent assault on the former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and tried to kill Afonsa Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo party spokesman Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government blames the conflict on Renamo, because they say it attacked the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to allay fears of instability.
Mr. Guebuza told the French news agency AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a "scoundrel" who wanted to use "anything left of his strength to try to prove that he can dictate his own decisions to the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
But concerns were heightened when Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was withdrawing from the 1992 peace accord.
He told the FT that he meant that the Frelimo side no longer respected the agreement.
'Our aim is to get back to negotiations, but with seriousness,' Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the two sides have done little to ease tensions between the two sides, fuelled by a series of skirmishes this year.
It is a battle between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
Neither of them is a good negotiator, and neither of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which has been pushing for electoral change, has already said it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an attempt by the dying movement to gain benefits and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral share has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), founded by a former Renamo party member, is expected to improve its electoral position.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza, who is running for a second term next year, wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democratic system, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to vacate the presidency", Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options Renamo has, but it has carried out a series of terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.
Most of the fighting took place in Sofala province, which is hundreds of kilometers from the capital Maputo but which is home to Beira, a port relied on by mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, for their coal exports.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr. Mazanga declined to comment on whether Renamo would repeat its threat.
Renamo wanted to warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique was not good, Mazanga said.
The instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people also have concerns about corruption, slow development and the recent spate of kidnappings.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems", he says.
Protester Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
'Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads,' he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as "models for a way of life", says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that brute strength cannot equal cunning cunning, while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
A large proportion of myths would be 'too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene' for school teaching, said Crossley-Holland, who advocates a careful selection of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's great that myths and folktales are already part of education", he said.
I've been advocating this plan for 20 years.
He added that 'openly educating' authors and teachers are 'switching' up stories with 'under-the-threshold' messages for children.
Cross-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from English and who also wrote the Penguin Book and the British National Myth, says: "You may have good intentions, but you do better by keeping them to yourself".
I think the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is that there's a need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end happily ever after, but there has to be a natural sense of right and wrong.
And it has to be subconscious; revealed through the story, not openly stated.
The old adage is that it's better to show than to describe.
The Brno Observatory takes visitors into space in a new digital
At first glance, it's obvious that the hall of the grand planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can cram into new comfortable seats, and a 55-foot-diameter [17 m] dome-shaped projection screen from the American company Spitz has been added above their heads.
In the center of the room is its most important part, the new projector from Japan.
To enhance the picture, additional smaller projectors are scattered throughout the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the walls of the auditorium.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate the image", said the director of the Brno Observatory, Jiří Dušek.
The computer ensures that the image from several projectors does not overlap but gives a unified impression.
"The computers are 30 to 40 times more powerful than conventional personal computers", noted Tomáš Hladík, a technician at the observatory.
The DigiTarion can create an extraordinarily realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.
It puts the audience in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is nearest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The studio is planning to show the purchased shows and their own productions.
There are two shows on the schedule starting Saturday.
The first one is called Astronaut and it's for adults.
People learn about astronaut training, go into space, spin the centrifuge, and then see the harsh conditions astronauts face in space through vivid examples.
The second program is for children and is called The Magic Cliff - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until a nearby volcano erupted.
The entire digitium cost about 50 million crowns, paid mostly by the Ministry of Education.
The City of Brno and the Observatory also contributed smaller amounts from their budgets.
The screen cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest was eaten up by audio-visual equipment and computers", Dušek explained.
The installation of the digitária followed the reconstruction of the entire building that the observatory underwent two years ago.
According to the director of the Duška could still come by the end of the year 25 to 30 thousand visitors.
We have studied 11,000 Indians!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis detected over 11 000 job advertisements, of which 4300 were published in daily newspapers and 6800 (62%) on the Internet.
The Internet is thus becoming the most important medium for posting job vacancies.
In 2005, when the survey was first conducted, it still accounted for 26%.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010) it was around 60%.
The analysis shows that job advertisements reflect to a large extent the current situation on the labour market.
An example is a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published during a period of economic prosperity and during a period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25 900 advertisements were published in the same reference period, less than half in 2012.
The Internet job offer is geared towards a narrower, more highly skilled group of professions.
By contrast, the daily press's job offer covers a wider range of occupations, including those of the working class, said Pavlina Šťastnová, the author of the analysis.
The representation of the selected professional groups varies in both media.
Ads for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts took the top spots on the Internet.
The positions of programmers or small business managers were only listed on the Internet.
The proportion of these professions in the daily press is considerably lower, but the service and manual professions are particularly well represented.
The most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through advertisements are, of course, education.
Other areas of focus included foreign language skills, particularly English.
In daily print, the requirement to know a foreign language was mentioned in three per cent of advertisements, and on the Internet in 37 per cent.
Only in two per cent of the advertisements did employers require active knowledge of two foreign languages.
The demands for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 per cent of the advertisements (11 per cent in the daily press, 57 per cent on the Internet).
Experience in the field was requested in 54 percent of the advertisements.
The practice requirements are all linked to the skilled trades.
These are mainly the production managers and other executives.
The workers are mainly mechanics and repairmen, or manufacturers and processors of food products, or repairers of electrical appliances, added the author of the study, Jiří Tillner.
Employers also mention the qualification and skills requirements of potential candidates in half of their advertisements.
Communication skills have long been the most requested skills in advertising.
Furthermore, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, independence, responsibility, organisational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: the tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: the new Yorker: the comedy festival is the new york comedy festival: the new yorker: the new york comedy festival is the new york comedy festival: the new york comedy festival is the new york comedy festival: the new york comedy festival is the new york comedy festival: the new yorker: the new york comedy festival
New York City is arguably the birthplace of solo comedy in America: almost a century ago, the comic-show artist Frank Fray, who worked as the president of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the assembled crowd in the interviewing method.
Faye's innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines solo comedy institution, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year  with over sixty performances in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles have appeared in the Carolines and have become successful to the point that they are too big to be played in a club", Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wandy Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, the annual musical-comedy benefit show at Madison Square Garden that features Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby, among others.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several of the comics participating in this year's festival came from non-traditional channels, such as shows on smaller radio or television companies such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has been doing his own sitcom (a fun spicy "League" on FXX's fantastic football theme) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a cast member on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, but is most famous for her viral video series Marcel the shell with shoes on.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (the surrealistic pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the scratchy, racially-oriented W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest highlights of the festival will be the interview, where David Steinberg will speak to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting is at the Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
"This town is definitely in the comedic DNA of all of Larry's work", Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down the aisle between the two buildings and he's like, "Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here".
The price of oil has dropped further to $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, as concerns about high inventories were offset by a report that showed a strengthening of China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The U.S. crude oil benchmark for December deliveries fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in the late morning European electronic trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
It was down 39 cents on Thursday and 5.8 cents behind for October.
The oil reserves have weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. inventories have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, the stockpile has increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese production triggered a higher demand, which showed an increase in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth picked up in the third quarter to 7.8 percent after two previous weak decades.
Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil used by U.S. refiners, fell 26 cents on the London International Trade Exchange to $108.58 a barrel.
Not that, Mr. Hush.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the way.
We must put pressure on Martin Hašek to be removed from all political positions and to resign from parliament.
Any other solution would lower the level of political culture that is already so meager.
Martin Hašek is proud of the promise he made, but everyone, and politicians in particular, must be aware of the consequences of a promise and carefully consider what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that a politician has (Mr. Babiš has the material one, but it is a question whether he is a politician).
The best program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
In politics, you don't apologize, in politics, you step back from the line.
Mr. Hushku, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me, if you haven't just lied - here you see how difficult it is with lying), you will leave politics alone, like a man.
People will then accept your apology as the expression of a man who made a mistake and bears responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as a helpless weakling whose words and deeds cannot be trusted.
You either want to be a proud, if misguided, human being or a lifelong screw-up.
It may seem unfair to address only you, but you are the leaders and they are the lost sheep.
And you are a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you're trying to sit back, regroup, put up the disgrace and strike again, but that's partisan or rebellious.
You are, I repeat, in your leader's eyes, an alpha male, so act like one.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The court blocked the ordinance regarding the procedure for stopping and searching persons by the NYPD
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked an injunction requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-search program and dismissed the judge in the case.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision will be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal filed by the city.
A judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city's findings and its correctional ordinance were challenged, including a decision to assign a superintendent to help the police department change its practices and its training program related to them.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments for the postponement requested on Tuesday.
The appeal court said the judge must be removed from the case because she had come into conflict with the judge code of conduct by not acting as a judge in accordance with the requirement to avoid appearances of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she openly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unjustly targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their stop-and-search program.
It has established an independent watchdog to oversee major changes including reforms in procedures, training and surveillance, and has ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test body-worn cameras in some of the areas where arrests are most frequent.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of keeping names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after police searches.
The oral argument for the City's dismissal is scheduled for sometime after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-search tactics have been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
There's been stopping and searching in some form for decades, but the recorded searches under independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically increased to a record 684,330 in 2011, with the majority of the cases involving blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom are minorities, filed a lawsuit that became a class action.
Proponents of changes to the stop and search program by the NYPD argue that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may affect how other police departments use these procedures.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale but not crime, and that it wastes money but does not solve the wider problem of the police force under pressure after having been reduced by several thousand personnel over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching people, which is constitutional, but reformed the way the NYPD conducted searches.
One fifth of shopping centres are experiencing low attendance
This is according to the real estate consultancies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krakow Shopping Centre, the 19th shopping centre in Prague, opens to the public in Bohnice.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
Poor performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centres.
The main problems are the inadequate size of the centre in relation to the location and the wrong layouts, i.e. too many paters or complicated and unclear arrangement of passages, or dead spaces in the centres", said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the head of the department of retail real estate, Lang Jones LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about one fifth of the shopping centers are struggling with low attendance.
The main reasons include poor transport accessibility, low income category of local population or oversaturation of the market in the given location.
Some projects opened with almost full capacity, but their results were mainly unsatisfactory at first.
Today's consumers are conservative and reluctant to change their buying habits.
New shopping centres need to do more to attract their customers to new brands, entertainment, services and marketing events", added Samadi.
The occupancy of shopping centers is generally stable, according to Sotak, even rising in some centers, because the landlords were willing to discount the rent and rent some units in the crisis.
"It is true that some projects have recently been opened which are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average occupancy (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)", added Soták.
The shopping centres opened in the last two years are slowly making their mark on the market, according to Sylvia Samadi.
But there is a market for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague, we see a space for the construction of a project that would serve the residents of Prague 6.
There is certainly room in the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', focused on shopping and daily needs services for the population living in the immediate vicinity", said Samadi.
According to Soták, there is also a place for other shopping centers in the domestic market.
This applies to small 'service' centres, large projects in Prague, medium-sized projects or expansions in regional cities.
"Cities such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth", added Soták.
In Prague, he sees space for a shopping center on Vítězné náměstí, and according to him, Na Příkopě Street and Václavské náměstí have a clear potential.
'There is an intensive expansion of retail parks, which allows retailers to cover and expand into smaller and smaller cities at favourable rental and operating costs, and there is also space in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior department stores, which benefit from a good location,' added Dita Kubánková of DTZ.
The Czech Republic currently has 90 modern shopping centres with a total gross leasable area of over 2.2 million square metres.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Of the 20 largest shopping centres by number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to Incoma GfK.
The Czech Republic is below the EU average in the number of shopping parks, and the Czech Republic is about 50 square metres per thousand in comparison to the UK and France.
Coulson hacked into the phone to verify a tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson allegedly used methods of "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to confirm a fraudulent tip of a love affair allegedly involving then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey that the News of the World had picked up fake reports in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his attractive special adviser Hannah Pawlby.
The paper hired private investigator Glenna Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voice mail and invade her privacy, but it was reported in court that Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The state's attorney is suggesting that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a man who stands outside the house hoping to catch people outside, but a man who likes to feed people stories to see what they say", Mr. Edis said.
He said that NotW used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
He obviously knows about the other one, the stalking, he has to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "Of course he knows".
Rumors of a love affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW's reporting department when a source who had been sexually interested in Ms. Pawlby was told, "Jen is wasting your time, she's with Charles".
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions, obtained at Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records in the private investigator's computer where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were identified as "Projecty".
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Ms. Pawlby's movements.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, saying, "I have a story that we're going to publish tomorrow that Charles and I would love to talk about".
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was patterned after other high-profile figures, including former Secretary of the Interior David Blunkett.
In court on Thursday, it was reported that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett about having an affair with a married woman, while he was seeing his co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied colluding with others to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have all admitted to hacking into the phone.
NSA exposure increases public paranoia about state surveillance
One quiet day in late August, a German police helicopter hovered over the American consulate in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the behest of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission's purpose was to take photographs of the roof of the US forward-looking patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media reports say the BfV office hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this action triggered an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the US does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to steal trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of US companies and thus enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits.
But ever since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower-turned-collaborator, began revealing his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, European governments and leading businessmen have been left wondering whether to believe the Director's words.
After reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil companies and gained access to data held by U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, widespread paranoia about state surveillance reached new heights.
The latest leak has revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone has been tapped for perhaps a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then surely the leading businessmen are also potential targets.
Snowden has exposed the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and corporations.
I would say it's possible that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
'Germany must wake up,' said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey released in July by EY's consultancy service, German companies believe that the US now poses as much of a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
But in all the documentation uncovered by Mr. Snowden, there is no evidence so far that the United States has passed on trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet skills and said it should try to reduce its reliance on the US:
Top businessmen are skeptical of this.
There are voices in the German parliament saying we should make a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly...
That's not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scope and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies revealed by Snowden is shocking to some companies that have hitherto believed that China posed the greatest threat of surveillance.
There's a big shift in cloud computing, where European officials have become more aware that data stored in the U.S. falls under U.S. jurisdiction and is potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the business community Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members cancelled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after the discovery of the U.S. Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, one of the SAP CEOs, says, "We have this new question for customers that wasn't there a year ago - where is my data stored, and can you guarantee that it will physically stay in this jurisdiction?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being conducted is no surprise.
It's always been done.
'This has been a major topic for many years and has not changed significantly during the current debate,' says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF agrochemicals.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them because it's in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to boast about the countermeasures they have taken to avoid giving the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large corporations, it has long been reminded that taking a free USB drive to a trade fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is the least sensible thing to do.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of Audi, says that for many years it has been common practice to collect cell phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices.
The German BfV advises senior managers to consider not using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the risk that smartphones can be misused.
Subscriber's cell phones are discarded afterwards.
However, there is a concern that SMEs will remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their specific fields.
Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorised access,warns the BfV in its report.
The U.S. is warning its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate documents listed France in February as the second-highest perpetrator of hacking for economic intelligence, next to Russia and Israel, and second only to China.
A board member at the German Risk-Free Society concluded that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of France's domestic intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies".
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia who died in a freak accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a Georgia underage boy whose body was found inside a wrestling gym in his high school gym believe their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found dead on January 11th, in a reclining position behind the bleachers at the high school gym he attended.
Sheriff's investigators from Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died in an accident, but the 17-year-old's family denies that.
"They are absolutely convinced that their son was murdered", Benjamin Crump, the attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said he did.
"They are convinced that it is against logic, against the laws of physics and against common sense", said Crump.
They believe that this is to cover up what really happened, to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he came back in a body bag", he said.
District Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he's conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
"The world is in a state of emergency", Moore said at a news conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for a routine investigation", he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died of asphyxiation.
However, according to Moore, the second autopsy revealed a different cause of death.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed", he said.
Moore added that if the Johnson death case reveals enough evidence to warrant an investigation into a crime or civil rights violation, he'll ask the FBI to enforce it.
A deputy from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment Thursday.
A judge in south Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators have reviewed.
The teenager's parents are hoping the video footage will contain a clue to reveal how their son died.
CDC has issued guidelines for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines to help children with food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the U.S. government has issued, and it's because of the increasing number of school-age children who suffer from food allergies.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about children's food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
Schools are also advised to have adrenaline available - the EpiPen is the most commonly used auto-injector - to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also lists typical symptoms that occur in interviews with children who have had an allergic reaction.
A child may say: 'It's like someone poking me in the tongue' or 'I feel like I have hair on my tongue' or 'It's itching my tongue'.
Parents of intersex children can choose a gender-blind gender
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with an ambiguous sex-determination.
Newborn children will no longer be assigned male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to indicate any gender for such children, and allows them to list their gender as "unclear" or "unspecified" on their birth certificates.
The law aims to stop pressuring parents to rush their child to have sex-determination surgery and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years, "I am neither a man nor a woman".
I'll be a doctor-made scrape, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that one out of every 2,000 babies born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They're intersex, part of a group of about 60 things that fall under the diagnosis of sexual developmental disorders, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, genital glands (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Gender determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and determine it rather than wait and watch the child's psychological and physical development until surgery is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-determination issues, said the new German law "looks like a good thing".
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children do not", he said.
Gender determination can be done without surgery and then you can wait for the identity to develop.
Knowledge of how a child's sex develops is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not bound by gender but by their biological make-up, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These traits may be expressed in secondary sex characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breast and figure, in primary sex characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't match any gender now have a separate camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to designate male, female, or a third gender in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, 52, from Australia, became the first person to be recognised as "genderless" in June, when she won a court appeal to retain her gender-neutral status for life.
According to the Home Office, German passports will have a third designation, X, for intersex people, in addition to M (male) and F (female).
In neighboring France, according to a news report on France 24, gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from the heavily Catholic country signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also took a stand against the German law, writing: "With the world being dragged into a new state where gender is a matter of choice but sexual activity is not, we are upsetting two other pillars of civilization".
A mother of a newborn in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would prefer to see her baby assigned a gender at birth.
'Parenting is stressful on its own, even without additional constraints, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,' she told a parenting website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, both male and female babies were called hermaphrodites, after the handsome Greek who was bisexual.
And about a decade ago, the medical community thought that gender was like a chalkboard that could be erased and redrawn.
But now many question the ethical basis of the surgery, saying that gender is a complex issue and doctors can sometimes make wrong decisions because they don't know how their children will feel about their gender when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency room", Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you didn't elect a psychiatrist, you elected a surgeon.
The prevailing theory on how to treat children with gender ambiguity was put forward by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender is malleable.
He created a new concept of "gender identity" and argued that social causes and environmental influences - how parents raised their child - affected a child's genes and hormones and shaped a child regardless of whether he was identified as male or female.
But in one 1966 case, known as John/Joan, his theory became moot.
He recommended that the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged by a wrongly performed circumcision should have their child completely neutered, his testicles removed, and brought up as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different", Drescher said.
When the boy was 15, he had his operation back on the boy and married the woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors still use this model today.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations became dissatisfied with the outcome.
So was Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes but ambiguous sex characteristics.
The doctors weren't sure if he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man, he would never be able to live a satisfying life.
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
At 12 years old, he got the female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl", he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18, he was sent to a vaginal plastic surgeon.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
I was sterilized from birth and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a developmental disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to allow his genitals to develop properly.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, took doses of testosterone and had his breasts removed,
The surgeries have caused his infertility.
Today, she represents others in an organization called the Interface Project, and she's trying to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the California-based legal group Advocates for informed choice, fears that the German law calls for stigmatization and stigmatisation.
"Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a quick decision and choose a 'non-readable' child", she said.
We're afraid it will incite an intervention.
We think it's better to assign a male or a female and then wait.
But we don't know what the law will ultimately say, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because it allows adults to choose to be classified as a third gender.
Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legally valid gender, she said.
The German law is about to assign him at birth.
That's a battle a little kid shouldn't be fighting right now.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual developmental disorder and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said that German law gives authority to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie's female features have evolved.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now 29 years old, Katie is married and working as a student intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
'The law gives parents some leeway to not rush their decisions,' Baratz said.
It gives them time to run some tests and think things over, and it gives them time before they write "male" or "female".
In that respect, all is well - you are raising your child and loving him.
You have a wonderful child, and you're happy about it.
There's no need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
'It gives the child the opportunity to be involved in the decision-making process and takes away the anxiety that parents feel because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,' she said.
Eventually, the child will decide which gender he or she identifies more with, and that's a great thing.
It gives the kids the power to make their own decisions.
The drunkard poured gasoline on the whole house, threatening to burn it down with his family!
The tension was rising, the fear was escalating.
The man started threatening to burn down the house.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area went to the scene, as well as the fire brigade of Mladá Boleslav and the volunteer fire brigade.
A police negotiator arrived at the scene, trying to reason with the man about his irrational behavior.
The man kept threatening to burn the house down.
A SWAT team must have broken into the house, disabled the man and handcuffed him.
The attacker was then taken to the Jovanobolsk Hospital for examination, from where he was transferred to the alcohol detention station.
The firefighters eventually poured gasoline on the house, which was later cleaned up.
All the animals were rescued from the house, including the people.
The man didn't give in to the police negotiator, so the squad went after him.
Report: Obama campaign was considering replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest adviser, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton for the 2012 presidential nomination.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann  Double down: Game Change 2012.
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's top aides were holding intensive group meetings and surveys in late 2011 to gauge whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading hopes for reelection.
According to Times national-politics correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough account of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to gauge what effect the election would have had on former Secretary of State Clinton's move to vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president's closest advisers, including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, and former White House chief counsel David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew the change was under consideration.
The book Double Down argues that Daley was the leader of the effort to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they ultimately decided not to make the move when data showed that adding Clinton to the list would not have significantly increased Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I have done extensive research on a number of things, and this was one of them", he said in a statement for the Daley paper.
You must remember that at that time the president had a terrible outlook, so we were like, "Jesus, what are we going to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as "careful", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the reelection campaign had invested a lot of money to see if the move would pay off in the election.
"When you're campaigning, you don't spend that kind of money on elections and qualitative research when you're really serious about something", Martin said on AC360.
It's not clear that Obama was aware that his team was considering the exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about this potential card shuffling.
While Daley said he didn't think the president was aware of the potential changes, the former chief of staff admitted it was possible that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double Down" definitely doesn't answer the question of whether the political probe got to Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama was unaware of the research surrounding Biden's candidacy.
"Maybe", said Martin.
A fantastic ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has made the first ice cream that glows in the dark using a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine creature to develop a light-bright snail.
He got the idea after reading a paper on jellyfish and convincing scientists in China to chemically produce a protein that causes lightning.
This ice cream reacts with the tongue of the consumer, raising the pH of the protein and subsequently causing its radiation.
Chris says that ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, and therefore the more you lick it, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company 'Lick me I'm delicious', says: 'It's a wonderful substance, but as far as the production is concerned, we're just starting, so for £200 you get about 2 g of this substance.'
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up the protein, the pH rises and the ice cream starts to glow.
We've been testing it for the past few months, and it seems like a great Halloween idea because it produces this fantastic glow effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each hill costs me about £140.
But it's delicious.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unconventional flavours of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next product is going to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make invisible ice cream".
It's essentially impossible because of the refraction of the light from the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I'm counting on finding a way to do it.
The ice cream is made using the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially created by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By the numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat candy, stay up late, and show off to the neighbors in disguises.
I feel like I've become a caretaker today.
For two years, there hasn't been a candy bar in my apartment, and this year is unlikely to be any different.
However, statistics show that I'm the black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), this year, most Americans - in fact, 158 million of them - will celebrate Halloween, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and decorations.
But what I always look forward to on Halloween is trends.
According to the NRF, of the $6.9 billion spent, $1.2 billion is expected to go to costumes.
This year's latest fashion trend is sexy inanimate objects.
It's not just women that are sexy anymore; it's foods like pizza, hamburgers, and carrots.
As for the men, I expect we'll see a lot of zombies because of the parade of the dead, and I bet the Daft Punk space men will make it to our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched for costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with following tradition.
Last year, we dressed our dogs in costumes, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
So there's gonna be a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to candy, we're not wasting time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's roughly 300 million pounds of Hershey's, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark's sticks.
This is great news for the 41 million people who, according to the US Department of Commerce, are about to invade our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, and believe it or not, we consume, 100 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Candy Company Association, nearly 16,000 tons of corn candy is sold around Halloween.
That's about nine billion individual corn candies.
That's a secret I never solved.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than a haunted house.
They have the best names, like "Terror behind the walls", "Howl-O-Scream", and "The house of shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 haunted houses in the United States that are officially dedicated, that have a $500 million revenue stream according to the Haunted Houses of America, and that includes those amazing photos of you farting in fear that your friend posts on Facebook, and you can't delete them, and the person you like looks at the photo and comments on it as "nice face".
And finally, a little bit about pumpkins.
When we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and carving pumpkin chandeliers is like decorating a Christmas tree. We've been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "baby in a crib" trend started with Pinterest only last year, so most of us grew up carving a crib instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with the flaming blaze on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins were grown this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to slice their almost one-ton pumpkin.
Announced series of racing Land Rovers
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts as well as intercom equipment.
There's a choice of advanced brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support, and inter-race storage.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The race people who come to Bowler have changed.
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want the thrill and the adventure and the attainable path to world-class racing.
We are delighted to be able to offer this journey in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe this format offers a new way to experience the different racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it prepares competitors for the toughness and reality of Rally Raid racing.
We've really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car  it's going to be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
We have a snap election in two years.
TOP 09 chairman Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another early election soon.
A week after the last one, in an interview with Aktuálně.cz, he said that there is no other way and that every government that has emerged from the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible dead end.
"It cannot last long", said Karel Schwarzenberg, estimating the lifetime of the incoming term to be two years.
He disagrees with the suggestion that voters will hardly choose a completely different way next time: "I think it will be a bit more balanced decision".
At the same time, the chairman of TOP 09 does not accept that his party could lose voters like this year in the next elections (compared to 2010 it lost about 300 thousand votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear within two months that the early elections will take place, it will strengthen the movement of ANO 2011 Andrey Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Granny will lose.
The turbulent situation in ČSSD, where Chairman Bohuslav Sobotka after a secret meeting of the party's leadership declared that in the leadership of the Social Democracy either he or Michal Hašek will remain, Schwarzenberg comments:
"Democratic Party leaders like little boys go to the head of state to allow them to make a coup in the party".
"I thought Mr. Hashek was smarter and more intelligent".
"Because I've never seen anything so badly done in my life", added the chairman of TOP 09.
And towards President Zeman (who he clashed with in the presidential battle) he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: he wants to take over the party".
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise for you personally in the election?
TOP 09 has already formally presented its first draft laws in the House, including the Farsi Register of Contracts, which was discussed by the House committees before the elections, but fell under the table with the early elections.
The chairman of TOP 09 in an interview with Aktuálně.cz claims that such speed is given by the fact that "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to outpace similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO movement Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election campaign of "stealing" the program of the ANO movement with the idea of establishing a register of contracts.
TOP 09 now took advantage of the lead - simply dusted off a motion that had already been tabled in the second reading of the House.
Firefighters arrived to rescue a lost puppy, who was trapped 50 feet above the ground in a dangerous quarry.
Ruby the cock-spider ran away after a minor car accident.
Three days later, a man walking a dog spotted him trapped in a quarry.
Firefighters scrambled up a rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was rescued by firefighters who came to rescue him after he somehow trapped himself in a dangerous outlet in a quarry 50 feet above the ground.
Nine-month-old baby Ruby escaped a minor car accident Sunday afternoon and survived alone for three days until he was rescued from the quarry Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend, Becky Hall (20), were at the Flappit colliery in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby and to thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he ran away, got into a little accident, they frantically searched for their lost dog and posted challenges on social media.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed dog-watcher spotted Ruby stuck on a ledge in a quarry 50 feet above the ground.
The technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and rushed down to rescue Ruby, using an animal carrier bag to lift him off the rock.
The veteran chief of the technical rescue team, Andy Clayton, said the dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of a rock wall, 50 feet from the top and from the bottom.
He didn't budge when we rescued him. He was frozen to death.
But he's all right now.
He got some cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The fact that someone saw the dog is unbelievable.
Technical rescue team expert commander Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky during his escape".
There was a chance that he would be seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup, and other than exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: 'I was afraid when I saw the rescue operation.'
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to hold him again.
The vet said if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they've all been just great.
Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added: 'We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there.'
The firemen were great.
We just don't understand how it got there.
Mick Jagger says that after the 18 years of Katy Perry, he definitely did not drive.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said that she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old habits die hard".
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
She added: "That was a long time ago, and now he's very nice to me".
In a statement Thursday, Jagger's 70-year-old rep said he categorically denies that Katy Perry ever proposed.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's confusing him with someone else".
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones' concert tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: A divided Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time, the warning appears that the condition for an independent Scotland to join the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This gave rise to stories of passport controls in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that the Strathclyde papers mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but as you might expect, that didn't make the headlines.
Nor did anyone mention that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if that is convenient for them.
Since Scotland is now out of Schengen, the offer of continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession to Brussels in return for whatever it really wants from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
I heard a journalist duck say that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
Yet, there is an interesting thought behind this bearded tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why would you trade a London chump for a Brussels one, especially now?
This is the real story of Europe: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
As a result of the euro crisis, the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties dedicated to opposing the EU or abolishing the euro as a common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party founded this year came out of nowhere and already won almost five million votes in the September federal elections, effectively replacing the Free Democrats (the British equivalent of the Liberal Democrats) in the Bundestag.
There has always been opposition at home to the idea of a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis has become a defining moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the straitjacket placed on national economies through the clinging to the common currency, have led many to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running large budget deficits - this was true only of Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that locks its members into exchange rates that are favourable to German exporters  and that German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing its domestic currency, southern Europe is at a disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany in terms of domestic production.
The only help is to cut public revenue and expenditure, which Germany is urging.
Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper cause of European malfunctioning.
As a result of the 'green' energy policy promoted by Brussels  code to support French and German companies at the expense of consumers , European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for petrol as it does in the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have seen in the case of Grangemouth.
All the wage freezes in the world wouldn't stop the European petrochemical industry from being flooded with cheap US shale oil.
The result is a growing rebellion, especially in France, once an ardent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool to keep Germany in check and allow Paris to rise to Washington's level in the world.
But Berlin no longer needed Paris as a proof of political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the worn-out French economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, pro-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, pushing the ruling Socialists into third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote  a timely warning to British Labour that they cannot assume that a split on the right will automatically turn left.
How does Le Pen handle her newfound popularity among the white working class?
It would like to use the European elections next year to create an anti-European bloc across the European Parliament, working against the common currency.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
I think that in the near future, the growing anti-European sentiment and the anti-common currency sentiment will merge and destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but rather become something more free in the sense of 'a Europe of (sovereign) nations' favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and to join the US.
However, Washington's increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be a region of (in principle) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including the ability to tell Berlin and Brussels when to leave us alone.
I suppose Scotland would do well in the loose order of Europe provided it kept its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should follow the example of Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is  oddly  the most successful non-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition to the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence just to accept austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Maturing earlier
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanic women reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
Physical changes do not indicate that you are approaching puberty
No evidence of hormones or other chemicals
Experts say that the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early puberty.
The trend of earlier puberty is not as apparent in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be alarmed when her daughter starts to grow breasts and pubic hair at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are fairly common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time reassuring my parents that it's not usually a sign of rapid development toward full puberty", Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, hair growth on the thighs and armpits, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
Over the past 40 years, however, there has been little change in the age at which a woman begins menstruating.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years, compared with 12.75 years in 1970.
"When breasts start to develop, it takes at least two to three years before the first menstrual period occurs", said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem".
The most reliable test of how puberty will progress is time.
There is debate about what activates the actual onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8, a girl is considered to be "premature".
In most cases, the process slows down or stops  and can be monitored closely by paediatricians.
The faster growth may be the reason for the endocrinologist to perform tests to rule out serious problems, such as a tumour or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent the further effects of premature bone ageing, which can eventually lead to stunted growth and girth in adulthood.
Recommendations for medication and hormone therapy depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about the use of medication, but acknowledges that "suppressing puberty can alleviate a girl's behavioral problems and her feelings of being different from her peers".
Understandably, the other big problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have their period.
"They're worried about her getting pregnant or how she's going to handle the hygiene", Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock", recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of precocious puberty.
However, there is no coherent body of evidence yet that the hormones in milk or other foods, the chemicals in the environment, or the sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz is pushing the assumption that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study in girls aged 6 to 9 that linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are various explanations.
From a global perspective, it seems that patterns of early puberty are influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although facial and pubic hair appear in boys at an early age, the trend toward full-blown puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the American Association of Pediatricians (AAP) conference added to the complexity of the subject.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and toddlers.
"We have to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty", said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeo Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
'It may mean having to talk to your child sooner than you expect,' advised Kaplowitz.
If you remain calm, your child will likely respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need reassurance that, although this is premature, it is a normal part of life.
Nadia Konvalin as the barmaid.
He got a new job?
Actress Nadja Konvalink (62) appeared behind the counter in the role of a waitress and she did very well.
That the popular Czech actress was planning to change her profession and go into the bar business?
Konovalinka showed up at the James Joyce Irish Pub, and she was pouring beer.
I did it for the first time in my life and I was good at it.
My boss even offered me a job and a job making beer.
But I refused, preferring to stay at what I do to this day, acting", said Konvalinková, who was a guest at the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub, with a smile.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey now and then", the actress revealed.
Nadia's two-year-old friend and colleague Pavel Nový also appeared at the event.
I am dead and in this new life I must not drink.
I'm allowed one beer or one shot a day, and I try to keep that", the actor added.
Aircraft manufacturers are fighting over seat width, and big contracts are at stake.
A dispute over the width of second-class seats on long-haul flights has flared up among leading aircraft manufacturers, setting off a bitter exchange of views at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The subject of the dispute is the width of seats provided for long-haul flights for economy class  not exactly the width that airlines would normally prefer, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards to offer seats in economy class that are at least 46 centimeters wide, but major U.S. rival Boeing says it's up to airlines to decide.
The dispute comes as the aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell the largest version of their twin-engine long-range aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from November 17 to 21.
The way the rear of the aircraft is arranged, particularly whether there are 9 or 10 seats side by side, is the basis of the economic performance claims for new mini-jumbo aircraft designs.
Boeing says the upgraded 777X will carry 406 people in economy seats more than 17 inches [43 cm] wide, spread out 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 model will carry 350 people in 46-centimeter-wide economy seats spread out over 9.
The giant airplanes often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in the trade press.
Now ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to take the lead with more than 100 orders, Airbus is appealing directly to the public.
He recently previewed what could be the start of a new advertising war by showing financiers a picture of three people in a restaurant with the caption "Would you like it?"
'Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in seats narrower than those in regional turbo-jet aircraft,' said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
As the eating habits change, people are bigger, but the seats on the airplanes haven't changed radically.
From the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air travel, to the turn of the century, the average weight of the American between the ages of 40 and 49, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, increased by 10 percent.
According to the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, the average American in the 21st century is three feet tall.
Airbus claims that its rival is sticking to the seat concept from the 1950s, when the average width of the newly christened aircraft's seats was lower.
Airbus claims to have conducted research that suggests that a seat extension of one inch improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects Airbus' seat dimensions, saying it is not the aircraft manufacturers' responsibility to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the cabin experience depends on more than just the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do the things they believe they have to do to be successful", said Kent Craver, a cabin space expert.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, more elbow room is crucial, but for suppliers, it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
Behind this spur is a race in aircraft orders, with estimated trade over the next decade worth at least $700 billion in catalogue prices, enough to tip the balance of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the seating layout is exactly what's fueling the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that their latest twin-engine long-haul aircraft designs are 20 percent more efficient than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's performance claims depend in part on comparing the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
The unit cost benefit is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
'The reason Boeing is doing this is to fill more seats and make their planes more competitive with our products,' said Kevin Keniston, Airbus' head of passenger comfort for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are consistent with the many passengers that are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower charges.
"A 45-centimeter-wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an Airbus business perspective, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777", said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but they offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
Some aircraft dealers even carry a tape measure to check the competing arrangements.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density layout aircraft for low-cost airlines and regional travelers.
Airbus is offering a model A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for more cabin modifications by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single other manufacturer of large modern aircraft the call for new industry standards will remain unheard, but may deter a wave of 777X sales.
The number of HIV-infected people in Prague has exceeded 1,000
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected is increasing every year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later in 121 people, and in 2010 in 180 people.
Last year, 212 people were infected, a record number.
"I think there is no doubt that the total number of new cases will exceed 200 this year", said Miroslav Hlavatý, an AIDS expert who for years headed the Prague Light House for Patients.
According to him, 165 new HIV patients arrived in the country between January and September last year, compared to 176 in the same period this year.
Since the start of the follow-up until the end of September this year, tests have confirmed HIV in 1,710 men and 353 women, with the highest number of infections in Prague.
The number of them in September reached 1,005.
In the Central Bohemian Region, 206 people were infected.
The diagnosis was also made by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from the Moravian-Silesian Region, and 116 from the Ustech Region.
The least infected are from the Highlands, 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of the patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected by blood transfusions in the past.
But such a case has not been reported in the Czech Republic since the beginning of the testing, more than a quarter of a century ago.
Six children were also born with HIV, passed on from the mother.
The movie Gravity is a nonsense, but the show is beautiful, experts say
The fantastic film from the universe Gravity sold out in the Czech cinemas for some time after its premiere.
In October, it was seen by almost 150,000 viewers and grossed over 26 million kroner, according to the Union of Film Distributors.
Most reviews were positive.
Others, however, find it somewhat inconsistent.
The server asked experts from among astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and if they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Brno Observatory and Planetary Observatory): I like science fiction films, which I consider modern, dreamlike fairy tales.
Gravity is not excluded, even though it appears to be a "physically real" performance.
He's not, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it very much.
You can see, for example, Sandra Bullock's hair, which is kind of floating in a weightless state.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station are in distinctly different orbits, so they can't be seen in the same shot.
Some viewers have criticized the film's unrealistic effect and the overall behavior of the fire in its weightless state.
They said the suit wouldn't hold up to that kind of damage either.
The characters in Gravity often collide with objects, and the suits can withstand them without much trouble.
The plot was not spared criticism.
Such a tragedy in Earth's orbit is unrealistic, some argue.
Plus, he wonders why a doctor was sent into space to fix the technology.
People are arguing on forums about the "unrealistic" behavior of the ropes.
They say it looks like it's designed for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Prague Observatory): I've only seen it on the big screen, but I can definitely say I was fascinated.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but a science fiction film.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost an obligation) to not stick to reality.
"More than the inconsistency you mentioned, I was disturbed by the fact that a space station with a degrading level of technology (the last one being Chinese) was shown three times".
"The Chinese one, after all, will be at the end of the decade and probably look better than in the movie".
Vladimir Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In the computer-generated scenes, the authors very successfully try not to violate the laws of physics, and so the natural science-oriented viewer estimates that momentum is quite correctly preserved in various cosmic collisions and collisions, in the dictionary of physics, also the view of the Earth from space is very realistic, including the thin layer of the atmosphere and the polar rays that cover the polar regions.
The discrepancies are bound to be found on closer examination.
In addition, for example, I found in some scenes, when reading the comments, that the preferred direction of the orbit of various space debris in orbit appears to be reversed, rather than it should be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things the creators adapted to their needs, but I did not see any fundamental and heaven-calling errors against logic or natural laws in the film, and in comparison with other films of similar focus, it is clear that the creators cared about the credibility of the events depicted.
Among the things that don't make sense, the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in a different orbit to the ISS.
As a result, the speeds of the rescues are vastly different, and the rescue operation could not have taken place as depicted in the film.
And then, when Kowalski and Stone were separated, I didn't notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so it's not clear what the force is on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go when they're no longer moving towards each other.
A new nicotine vaccine may take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that may take the pleasure out of smoking cigarettes.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
There's more testing to be done before human trials, which will take years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York says the early signs are good.
"We certainly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is so strong that it overcomes all current approaches", Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to create antinequin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, thus preventing the smoker from getting nicotine shot.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice that were additionally given nicotine continued with their normal activities.
But the mice that weren't vaccinated were "calmed down", the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had entered their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given so frequently to maintain adequate levels of antibodies that they proved expensive and impractical.
The cost of the new vaccine should be much lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines were completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they would be tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
Smokers, however, are much more likely to use it to quit.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not get any benefit from it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them to get rid of this bad habit", he said.
The British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research is needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid.
The former Labor minister of New South Wales, Australia, will be investigated by the State Commission on Corruption.
Former NSW Minister Joe Tripodi denied that he would change the coastal rental policy at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several ministers of state to have his lease on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without him having to take part in the recruitment process after it expired in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating claims that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, based on evidence presented Thursday by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of negotiations that began in 2005, the government pressed for the leases to be put out to tender.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer contract terms.
In 2009, the leases for the Circular Quay businesses, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need for a public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister for Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public tenders.
He denied, however, that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, insisted on a shift in the government's rental policy.
The call logs submitted to the ICAC showed calls between August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Port Authority after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
'Was the development of commercial rental policy the subject of the discussions during these phone calls?' asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr Tripodi.
"No", answered Mr Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military planes have attacked a target in Syria, the official in charge said.
Israeli military aircraft struck a target in the Syrian port of Laziqiya on Thursday night, an administration official in charge confirmed to Fox News.
This responsible official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the targets were Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
Israel has carried out at least two airstrikes on missile convoys in Syria earlier this year.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
Maybe Pečinka's commentator spoke in a way that was acceptable, whereas President Štěch was not inciting a fight.
Hejtman Chovanec was a suspect to me from the moment he was elected to the board, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and is, a symbol of the misery of the CSSD.
The other gentlemen have shown their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and legible and unusable, Vice President Zaorálek has been the most talked about person on television.
Based on that, I see no better option than for the CPSD to propose Senate Vice President Gajdosková as Prime Minister, the only one who would not have an initial handicap and I think would perform standard performance.
It's such a good solution that hardly anyone in the leadership will support it.
I'm saying this is the only way to forget what happened and move on without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajdůšková could easily form a minority government with the mere blessing of Chairman Babiš and without the People's Party, but with the People's Party Minister of Health Hovorká, who is actually a believing Social Democrat.
This minority government would have great stability because it would promote the proper referendum law and that is what the president of the Usuichi Okamura has pledged to support.
President Babiš would eventually accept the tax advances because he's smart and he'll see that it's not possible without it.
Humans wouldn't be a problem, because the Speech is the best of what they have, and they wouldn't be in government otherwise.
The same goes for YES, here too, a valuable minister would be found, but if they reasonably do not want to enter into risky government participation, but provide support, fine as well.
Let's give courage to Elena Gajdoska!
Foreign workers with a visa entitlement may undergo an aptitude test
As the government intends to expand police intervention, it is considering a "legitimacy test" for foreign workers with a 457 visa.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia.
As the government's debate piece was released today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australian neighbours.
"The loud statements 'foreigners at the end of the line' and 'work first for Australians' are a very unpleasant relic of a time when unions called for a protected labour market", she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, it meant that the white man's workforce was protected, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone in this region recorded the echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion paper discusses 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Secretary Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday where he's dealing with officials over human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes and the rest remains to be considered.
If the eligibility criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail to determine whether their nomination is justified in a situation where the applicant is related or has a personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring enterprise.
In the case of a small number of employees, the number of employees is not always the same as the number of employees in the enterprise.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum ship in the Christmas Islands this week.
The man's frightened nine-year-old son had traveled with him to Australia, and after his father's death on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a hospital in the Christmas Islands, where he died.
The UK Government has announced a study aimed at enhancing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2's work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and the north of England will start once the first phase is launched in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bind Britain together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase Two is complete, it will run a line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from GBP 32,7 billion to GBP 42,6 billion.
The British Government, in discussions with Transport Scotland, the national transport authority, commissioned HS2 to identify additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving journey times for the north of England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: 'Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that will better connect Great Britain and its cities.'
We gave SH2 the green light because the benefits it would bring are huge.
Without that, we face a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about connecting across the UK. 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected thanks to HS2.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.
The Scottish Government was urged by Mr Carmichael to 'unequivocally' support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: 'The high-speed rail has the potential to bring immense economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds economic weight to Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across Britain.'
So we are very excited to be working with the UK government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed rail into Scotland, to bring benefits to everyone, and to complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report of this study with the UK Ministers over the next year and to deciding together on the next steps.
Along with Barta, the inspector and analyst were arrested by the anti-corruption police.
News of the arrest of Vita Barta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was brought to Prvnízprava.cz.
MF DNES soon found out that the case was taken over by the General Inspection of Security Forces (GIBS), whose people were supposed to arrest Bártu in the center of Prague.
It happened outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
The Inspectorate deals with cases where police officers are among the accused, but its jurisdiction also extends to civilians.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - the leading analyst and computer scientist Jan Petržílek - is among those arrested.
He used to work for the Security Intelligence Service.
Spokesman of the anti-corruption police Jaroslav Ibehej, however, refused to comment on the information, saying that the media should turn to the GIBS in this matter.
Even her spokeswoman, Inspector Radka Sandorová, refused to say anything about the case, instead referring to the Municipal State Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question in view of the protection of confidential information", said spokeswoman Štěpánka Zenklová.
Again, from this non-specific response, it can be deduced that the event took place, but is in a state of secrecy, which the spokesman does not allow to say anything specific.
The same is true of Bart's lawyer, Oldrich Chudoba.
The media said that he represented Bart "in this case as well", but since it was classified information, he could neither confirm nor deny Bart's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police chief Peter Lessy.
It was Bart who promoted him to the post, together with former President of the Council of Ministers, Radek John, who was at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute that arose between ex-Prime Minister Peter Nečas and VV even had to be resolved by the then President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where that connection to me came from.
I was never contacted, I was never questioned.
"I really don't know anything about the thing", Lessy told iDNES.cz.
In January 2011, Lessy became the chief of police.
Officially, Radek John was the one who put him in charge, but the real head of the party was Barta.
Bart now ran for the election for the Dawn Movement, narrowly missing out on the parliamentary mandate by 175 votes.
Dawn leader Tomio Okamura claims he has no idea what this is about.
"Vít Bárta was one of many candidates of many parties for our candidate and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not and is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamura", he distanced himself from Bárta Okamura, who before the elections said that he gave Bárt space to run for the Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of the executioners.
Vít Bárta was in court in 2012 with his former VV teammate Jaroslav Škárka.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers on Australian airlines will continue to be required to switch off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite changes in the US to relax regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given US airlines the space to change their practices so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of a flight, as long as the devices remain in flight mode.
Passengers can already do this for the majority of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they have no plans to change their practices anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that it had examined the notification but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,he said.
This issue is covered by regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with safety instructions received from crew members.
Virgin, which had already spoken to CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight wi-fi system, was in favour of the change but said it would be subject to the regulator's decision.
"We would like CASA to do an analysis of the permissibility of using electronic devices because we really think that now that we have [wireless onboard entertainment], it would improve the customer experience", the spokesman said.
Qantas has announced that it will stick to the current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices are not allowed to be used during take-off and landing, and we have no plans to change that anytime soon", he said.
The FAA rules apply to American airlines.
But we are constantly interested in regulatory developments that may be of interest to our passengers, and we certainly study the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it carefully.
For US air carriers, the impact of the rules will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate mobile phone interference, and revise manuals, training material, hand baggage programs and passenger information.
Once an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at any altitude, the FAA said.
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew shall instruct the passengers to switch off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seats or in an overhead storage area during takeoff and landing.
With the poverty of the middle class increasing, Singapore's pawn shops are booming
At a pawnshop in Singapore's Bendemeer Shopping Center, Janani Amirthalinga is pawning a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for her daughter's school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money into it", says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Indeed, demand across Southeast Asia, where household debt is rising, is such that ValueMax, where the woman is conducting her transaction, became the third-highest-ranked pawnshop on the Singapore Exchange this week.
Jewelry freezing is not only a quick way to borrow SGD 1300 cash in Ms. Amirthalinga's case, but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Singaporean banks routinely apply an annual percentage rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, the advantage of the halting stations is that they do not require a personal identification (payment history) or proof of income and can provide a loan more quickly than banks.
And so, with families feeling the strain of rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawn shops.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit supported by loose monetary policies in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to mortgage companies to deal with their worsening financial situation.
This week, the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency cited the rising use of credit by households, mainly due to rising rents, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product.
Malaysia tops the list with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also concerned about Thailand's high level of consumer debt, which had barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and weaker consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with rising costs, people from the middle to the low [income scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can", said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysia's CIMB Bank.
The historically high gold prices of the past two years have contributed to people's eagerly pledging their personal possessions and taking the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items pledged in the city's 200 pawn shops are gold.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, we'll stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month".
The largest pledge operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its pledge platform in recent months.
The growth in the pawnbroking industry is so strong that ValueMax, which operates a branch in the Bendemeer hub and 15 similar branches in Singapore, is planning to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia  where it has four branches  but also outside of Asia, says ValueMax CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance it using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it raised this week on the Singapore Exchange.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for their high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that the collateral not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but it also doesn't directly increase the debt.
Customers mortgage items they already own, and monetisation of personal property does not increase household debt,he says.
In society, asset pledging is increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, those who use pawn shops are not just those in financial distress.
Wealthy Singaporeans also use ValueMax branches to pawn gold bars or Rolex watches, and they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers come from all walks of life.
'They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow for short-term purposes for their venture-based business or investment, or small businesses that need help solving cash flow problems,' says Ms Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money as soon as possible.
A $325 million rescue package for the Tasmanian health service
The federal government insists that the $325 million rescue package for the failing health system in Tasmania include tough conditions that will ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is taking "urgent action" to avert the crisis caused by the island's aging population, higher rates of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The funding for the four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package which we believe will solve the specific problems facing the country", Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for patient-requested surgery.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic and cataract operations, will help to clear the debt.
Money is also being spent on free access to clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
'These investments are responding to ideas that leading clinicians have told me would help the Tasmanian health system in the best way,' Ms Plibersek said.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government must require a strict reporting regime and record keeping obligations.
The state would have to maintain its current funding levels to receive the Australian Commonwealth's money and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member committee will be established to ensure that the state delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will be worthless unless there is a genuine reform to lay a more sustainable foundation for Tasmania's public health system.
He nevertheless praised the government for responding to his request for expedited assistance, which he first raised in talks with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe that the federal aid package can bring the state's public health system out of its critical state", Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional elected procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a hoax.
"The reason I'm here is because the Labour government has taken $430 million out of our health care system", he told ABC TV.
You can't have the state government taking almost half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth of Australia giving away 300 million dollars, and pretend it's good news.
Mr. Dutton has asked Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout money will be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted the novel by Denise Diderote, which brings a unique cinematic journey and a re-creation of the era, but is also more boring than it should be.
It is set in the 1860s in France and tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young noble who is sent by her family to a convent.
When she rebels, she experiences extreme cruelty from her reprehensible mother's perversion and becomes the object of another's sexual passion.
A film never sinks to the level of glamour or sensationalism, and that's his problem.
The ceremonial nature of this story leads the audience to experience the agony of wearing a padded shirt.

Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production facilities, says watchdog
Syria has destroyed critical chemical weapons and poison gas munitions production equipment, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Committee said Thursday, as violent conflict erupted in the country's north, not far from one of the sites where the toxic materials are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said that since the start of the civil war nearly three years ago, more than 120,000 residents have been killed.
The notice from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before November 1st,
the term designated by the Hague-based organization for Damascus for the destruction or disabling of all chemical weapons production facilities and chemical mixing equipment for the production of poison gas and munitions.
The completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including yperite and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons factory and warehouse, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
An activist group that has been monitoring the death toll in Syria through its network of activists reported Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government side is said to have 29,954 members of Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 armed Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
The death toll also includes 2,202 government defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
That number hasn't been updated since.
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting rebels in Safir, many of them linked to al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday that there were casualties on both sides, but it didn't have a specific number.
The battles underscored the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors who are facing tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of its chemical arsenal amid the ongoing civil war.
In a statement, the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said that its team is now 'satisfied' to have verified 'and monitored' the destruction of 'Syrian declared essential manufacturing and mixing/refuelling equipment'.
He added that 'no further inspection activities are currently planned'.
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit two locations because of security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites had been "abandoned" by Syria and... the chemical weapons program items it contained had been moved to two other declared sites that had been "checked".
It was not immediately clear whether the Safir facility was one of the places that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
'I salute the courage and bravery you have shown in fulfilling the most demanding mission this organization has ever had,' said the Observatory's Director Ahmet Uzumcu in his comments issued by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war pits the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad government and its security forces, which are full of Alawites, a branch of Shi'ite Islam.
As for the further development, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdul Rahman, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion inside an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Laziqiya.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger at the sentencing of the Bali bombing mastermind
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted disparagingly to the verdict against the last of the perpetrators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should have been executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for assembling an explosive device used in the bombing.
He could be on parole in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution requested life imprisonment, although it could have insisted that the man nicknamed "Demolition Man" be executed because of his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of explosives.
This decision has rekindled the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other schoolboys nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
Ms. Corteen told AAP: "He should be brought before the firing squad".
I have to live with the fact that I'll never see my grandchildren or my daughters again.
Club Sari was razed to the ground on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., when a powerful charge placed in an outside van was detonated.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had detonated a bag of explosives.
The explosion left him in a coma for a month, and while he was being kept alive, he was pronounced dead three times by doctors.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should meet the same fate as the three other members of the Jamaat-e-Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the massacres of Amrozi, Muqla and Imam Samudra who were executed four years ago.
This guy should be on death row like no one else.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, there just isn't.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not so much.
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He evaded capture for nearly a decade, but was finally caught in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where less than four months later, U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily", said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he feels no remorse for the pain he caused others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be celebrated later this year, including ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We're going to see a lot of tears this year", said Mrs Corteen.
Patek still has a right to appeal the verdict.
FAA: Airline passengers can now use technology on board (but not call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate-to-gate in addition to calling from their mobile phones  to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music, under highly anticipated new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
How quickly the change is implemented will vary by airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft are compliant with the new rules and that they have updated their cabin crew training manuals and equipment stowage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly", the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors close.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches two miles and the captain gives the go-ahead.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again as the plane descends to land and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their devices during takeoff, landing and boarding, the FAA said.
The Commission therefore considers that the aid measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the change.
"Once the new rules are safely in place, and we will work closely with the transport companies to do so, it will be a success", Glading said in a statement.
We're getting tired of looking like scouts, to be honest.
However, surfing the Internet, sending e-mails and text messages, or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometers above sea level, the agency said.
Passengers will be advised to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
So still no Words with Friends, the online scrabble game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously thrown off an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to be stored further away for fear of being able to injure someone if they are flown around the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be prohibited on board.
The rules for using cell phones are not set by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert for CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigational devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause airborne interference to broadcast towers", Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the problem last month recommended that the government allow for wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been under pressure in recent years to relax restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, argue that there is no legitimate security reason for the ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of such devices is pervasive.
Some studies suggest that as many as a third of travelers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, a technical achievement of the time.
The new airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems than previous generation aircraft, but they are also designed, and certified by the FAA, to be resistant to electronic interference.
The Commission has also noted that the airport services agreement with Ryanair and the agreement with Ryanair were signed on the same day.
Plans modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to the increased use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Modern electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio signals than did devices of previous generations.
For example, electronic readers emit only minimal transmissions when the page is turned.
But the transmission is stronger when the device downloads or sends data.
Among those pushing to loosen restrictions on travelers' use of these devices is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded a commercial airliner with their Kindle e-readers and conducted a test flight, but no problems were encountered.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believes that the interference from these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference to air traffic control systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off their devices during instrument flight in low visibility.
The travel industry group welcomed the changes and said it was a sensible move for the traveling public, who are a big user of the technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not at odds with safety", said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was airlifted from a drilling platform in the North Sea and released back into the wild
The bird was brought ashore after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea and released back into the wild.
One rattlesnake was flown to Aberdeen by helicopter last month after being treated at a rescue centre by the Scottish SPCA until he recovered.
Colin Seddon, of the Centre for Operations, said: 'This carnivore probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught in a strong wind over the North Sea.'
Apparently, he ran out of energy and found refuge on an oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added, "He was unable to take off again, so we were contacted for help".
At the time of the snorting, he was in good shape and in good health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing businesses together and defining what changes UK businesses and job-creating companies want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of leading British business people to ask their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov surveyed 1,000 business leaders representing UK businesses of all sizes and from all sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside Europe, and focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see the government prefer new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil to the long and arduous process of reforming Europe's secretive institutions.
When we asked them for their views on specific policy areas - from monopoly regulation to product law - most business people felt that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market and businessmen said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweighed the benefits of being part of the European trading area.
And finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most telling finding, that a clear majority want Britain to pursue a treaty change and a relationship with the EU that should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, which were shared by businesses of all sizes and major business groups, show that the business sector is pushing for 'meaningful change' that carries the impact back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake in getting a treaty change and a better deal for the UK could mean a gain of up to 16% in the referendum vote to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to represent a significant shift from the current balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible and, as the eurozone embarks on the path to closer economic and fiscal union, increasingly necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as our survey results show, for business this means a refocus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach to Brussels.
John Kerry admitted: the spying went too far!
The United States has gone "too far" in its espionage at times, admitted US Secretary of State John Kerry during a video conference between Washington and London.
But the intelligence gathering, according to the minister, was used to prevent terrorist attacks.
The "first confession from Washington" according to AFP comes amid a fierce debate on both sides of the Atlantic over the scandalous revelations of mass surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which has targeted US allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as the president (Barack Obama) did, some of these actions went too far, and we assure you that won't happen in the future", Kerry said.
But in the interview, he was mainly defending the practice.
He said that information gathering was essential to combat terrorism and prevent attacks such as the September 11 attacks in the US in 2001, the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and the London attacks in July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to be informed in time of the attacks", Kerry stressed.
However, he again admitted that the information gathering "in some cases went too far".
The scandal of U.S. intelligence allegedly monitoring hundreds of millions of phone calls erupted in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans had also been monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone.
European leaders were not hiding their indignation, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would ban or significantly limit surveillance.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says the pipeline in Bulgaria is ushering in a new gas era
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, the Gazprom CEO said.
"Today marks a milestone: construction has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe", said Gazprom President Alexei Miller in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the routes of Russian exports through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia's gas to Europe, is adding to the risks of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are 'forever' removed.
Once the entire project is operational in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a reduced price.
Gazprom says construction is scheduled to begin in other countries in the direction of the flow later this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
The decisive battle is waiting.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the mountainous region of Kalamun.
According to reports, Israel destroyed missiles targeted at Hezbollah in a series of strikes on Wednesday in two locations in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the Syrian army.
Its agenda also includes fighting Israel, which is not involved in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday's Israeli airstrikes on weapons depots in western Syria are only just being confirmed.
Israel has not commented on the attack, but American sources have confirmed it.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean Sea hit the Syrian missile base Snubar Jabla south of Latakia.
Al-Arabiya news channel says two warehouses where the missiles were being prepared to be shipped to Lebanon were hit.
According to her sources, the missiles were Russian-made SA-8s.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yischah said Syria is continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles, and the Syrian air force is training members of Hezbollah's armed wing to handle missiles.
SA-8s are antiquated missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They're placed on a moving chassis.
Although they are relatively primitive, their mobility and small size make them easy to conceal.
They're equipped with radar, but it turns off after the missile is fired, making it difficult to target.
Latakia is in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.
It's a heavily guarded area, and Hezbollah has been involved in fighting in western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping to protect the Syrian Shia community, to which the Alawites belong.
Now, it is said that 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help the army recapture Kalamun.
The Syrian army is also reinforcing its forces there, along with Hezbollah.
Kalamoun lies between Damascus and Homs, the country's third-largest city.
According to al-Arabiya, the battle is in retaliation for the recent opposition attack on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite brigade Abu Fadl Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army this year to retake the town of Qusayr on the Lebanese border.
Many of the Kusayru rebels have just left for Kalamuna.
Until recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, wasteful spending on overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax hikes, and, not least, government scandals were cited as reasons.
The results of the election suggest that most citizens were satisfied with the situation.
That they were actually okay with the situation that was here (the stealing and the indebtedness of this state), they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise I can't explain why 3,413,497 voters didn't show up, 596,357 voters voted for TOP 09 384,174 voters voted for ODS, so a total of 4,394,028 actually supported the original ruling coalition, which represents 52.16% of all eligible voters.
Which is more than half a majority.
If we add 1 016 829 voters of the ČSSD to the above parties, then with the old order (because all the parties mentioned participated in the "stealing" and indebtedness of this state), then this state of affairs was actually approved by 64.23% of the eligible voters.
In effect, the majority of voters have shown that they are not in favor of punishing the guilty by stealing and over-indebting this state.
Or do you think the SSD members who took part in this will support the relevant laws?
Can we be of any help?

The Royal Commission has learned that before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord were filed, two employees of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)
The Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse has learned that before charges were brought against Caringbah-based child educator Jonathan Lord in 2011, two staff members of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were charged with child sexual abuse.
But it was stated before the commission that in its opening statement to the commission, the association stated that it had never dealt with a case of child sexual abuse in its organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case where a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another where a Caringbah YMCA gymnast was convicted in 1991 of sexually abusing children in his care.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, the committee's adviser, that he knew about the first case but not the second.
He admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was also inaccurate in stating that external audits had been conducted at the YMCA, which had valued the organization as a leading advocate of children's rights.
The evidence presented by the Commission indicates that the YMCA was notified that it had received the second lowest of four possible evaluations in the Ministry of Education and Society's audit in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that his own downward direction failed to accommodate Mr. Lord without making sure that staff were aware of their duty to report child safety violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually molesting 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was jailed for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Mr. Lord's violation of the safety of the children.
Staff members have provided evidence that they witnessed such violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, babysitting them privately, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and requested child safety training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of children's services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was 'very intimidating and often difficult to talk to'.
The CEO said he's not accepting evidence from staff that they felt uncomfortable contacting their superiors and reporting the acts.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord clouded their judgment, and so they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said that he had told the New South Wales YMCA board his view that the lesson of the Jonathan Lord case for the organisation was that staff had not reported, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to have staff sign non-disclosure agreements shortly after the allegations surfaced was made by YMCA General Manager of Children's Services Liam Whitley.
He said the goal was to avoid tampering with evidence, but it was "overzealous" and poorly done.
Child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organisation for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruitment, screening, recruitment, training and management of staff.
The hearing was postponed until December 20th.
Tony Blair said he would seize the chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but admitted that a return was unlikely.
In a late-night interview on the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when he stepped down after 10 years in the leadership, Mr Blair has mostly avoided conversations about British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as an envoy of the Far East Peace Quartet.
Asked if he would return to the prime minister's post, he was quoted by the London Evening Standard newspaper as saying: 'Yes, of course, but it's probably not going to happen, so...'
As crowds of show horse experts gathered in Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to all that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although not yet a schoolboy and only taking his first steps a few months ago, this little boy and his pet Shetland pony, Toffee, have made it through three rounds of competition to win the grand prize, leaving behind 30 dragging adults.
This indissoluble pair of equally tall men and women were commended for their looks, demeanor and style at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudry, near Cardiff.
He stood up to the ladies and gentlemen in the fancy hats, tucked his beret into a cheerful corner, and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around the circuit.
Fenton was commended by the jury for his natural ability to control horses that are far beyond his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton got Toffee in March for his third birthday and has been training with this Shetland pony every day since.
His mother Donna (30) said: "Fenton and Toffee are great teammates".
They didn't get their hopes up, but they left with a golden cup and flowers.
It was only the second time he'd ever competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal, and complete strangers wanted to take pictures with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says, "There was a stirring atmosphere and everyone cheered and applauded".
He ran the sand the entire length of the arena, and though he was so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is an animal man - he loves horses, tractors and the farm and he's got two chickens to take care of.
Considering how he's started, he'll be back in the Horse of the Year competition soon and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual show horse competition said: "The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control a pony".
They make a great team.
The judges have selected Fenton and Toffee for their outstanding speeches and the way they have performed on the competition circuit.
They're always watching how good the teamwork is between the pony and the pony-leader, and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton's lovely outfit helped, he really fit in there.
Too curious newspapers to be investigated
The Chinese newspaper that made the front page request for the release of a reporter accused of slander will be thoroughly investigated, the administrator told the press.
The Guangzhou New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes to make up stories about a company partially owned by the state.
The steward said the New Express newspaper is now making a full correction.
The order to amend came from the State Administration of Printing and Publication, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong Province.
The Commission also informed the Commission that it had not been able to verify whether the exporting producers in the PRC had complied with the undertaking.
"The editorial staff of the New Express was disorganized", the manager said in a statement.
He said he had to decide to give Chen Yongzhou an administrative punishment by revoking his journalism license.
He also ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a general correction of the New Express and recommended that they investigate the relevant responsible persons in the New Express and change the leadership of the New Express immediately.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express concerning financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published two petitions for his release on the front page, claiming that he stood behind his journalistic work.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted to giving false stories for a bribe.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and also to the entire media sector and its ability to gain the trust of the public", he told state news channel CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I know I've done wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a front-page apology, stating that he had failed to conduct adequate vetting of his reports.
Recently, several of the most closely watched suspects have made confessions on television.
Experts say that forced confessions are still regularly made, despite a law change this year that prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
A drug smuggling tunnel has been found between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated drug-smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been discovered, complete with its own lighting, ventilation, and electric railway.
U.S. authorities described the tunnel, measuring about three feet by four feet, as one of the most ingenious secret passageways they had ever discovered.
The tunnel, which is almost six football fields long, connects a warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, with one in San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is full of undefined warehouses where it's easy to hide the trucks before they load up with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before the drugs could be transported unnoticed.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men, who authorities say worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.
If convicted, he faces a sentence of 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are infiltrating the extensive drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after a marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which has drug cartels struggling to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 2,000-foot-long corridor with tracks that led from a kitchen of a Tijuana home to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economia and Centrum are linked by management.
For example, they offer joint advertising
The new integrated newsroom of Economia in the Prague quarter.
Economia has taken another step towards transforming the holding company Centrum into its media house.
As of Friday, Economia and the Center have a joint top management.
"The unification of the organisational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of the two publishers into a common media house", commented the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Economie and the General Manager in charge, Kamil Čermák, on the changes.
Mr Čermák, who will head the unified management, will be joined by Mr Andreas Demuth, the CEO of Centrum Holdings.
The new joint director of the store was named Pavel Vopařil, who is also subordinated to the advertising director of both companies, Zuzana Tylčerová.
The new chief of information technology has become Stepan Burda.
The joint editorial director is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team includes the transformation director Jakub Unger.
The newly created function of Marketing Director was entrusted to Adéla Pitts.
The separate Corporate Communications Division is now run by Vera Lhotská.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, the human resources management for both publishing houses is led by Petra Slabá.
'The new organisational structure will enable us to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better link the content creation of all the titles published and, last but not least, to significantly streamline the company's business management,' added Čermák.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, signed a deal to buy Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
The portfolio of Centrum Holdings consists of the Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz servers, web portals, a large e-mail base under the Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz brands, and SMB agency Najisto, as well as a portfolio of nearly two dozen other smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, the news server IHNED.cz, the weekly magazines Respekt and Ekonom and a number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
In June this year, the publishing house moved to newly built modern premises in Karlín, Prague.
CME is targeting the television business.
They're laying off almost a quarter of the people.
CME Media Group is going to be dismissed.
He wants to cut a thousand jobs by the end of the year.
Osekat is going to cut all of the side activities and focus on its core business, broadcasting.
The group, which owns TV Nova in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of about 4 500 people.
Almost a quarter of the workforce will be out of work.
The media group operates television stations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds the licence for broadcasting TV channels Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the music channel MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what it will mean for the domestic TV channel TV Nova, is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we really cannot comment on it", said the director of communications of Nova Josef Koukolíček.
According to the information provided by MF DNES, significant redundancies in the Czech Republic are inevitable, but the most significant impact would be on the staffing of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both of Nova's new CEOs Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who took over from long-time CEO Adrian Sarbu, spoke during Wednesday's conference call with analysts about wanting to limit all activities not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce in particular the costs of producing its own programmes, filmmaking and production activities.
A cooling tower in the Czech Chemical Works in Prague burned down last night .
A large storage tank was on fire in the industrial area of the Czech State Railways in Prague, apparently a cooling tower, according to the fire department.
"Firefighters were already on the scene Thursday before 11 p.m. and were still fighting the fire this morning", announced Pavlina Adamcová, a spokeswoman for the Prague fire department.
The amount of pollutants in the air in the surrounding area was not measured to exceed the permitted limits.
The extent of the damage and the cause of the fire are unknown.
About fifty firefighters have arrived at the Kolbenov Street site.
"This is a large-capacity tank fire, probably a cooling tower", Adamc said.
"There is no functioning fire hydrant network in the premises, so we extinguish it using the pipeline from the cisterns", she added.
According to the tn.cz server, the malfunctioning of the fire hydrant network complicated the shutdown, so the firefighters had to transport water from elsewhere.
The fire department commander has issued a second-level fire alarm.
There are four stages in total, with the fourth stage being used in the most serious cases.
Chemists were also on the scene to check for the level of hazardous chemicals that might have been released in the fire.
"But they did not detect any airborne contaminants that exceeded hygienic standards", said a spokeswoman for the fire department.
British police have delivered Assange an extradition notice
British police have today delivered an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said they had delivered an extradition notice to the 40-year-old Australian asking him to come to the police station and that if he did not, he could be arrested.
Under British law, Assange has exhausted his options when the Supreme Court this month overturned his appeal against extradition, and he faces extradition to Sweden on sex crimes charges.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge on June 19 at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard has issued a notice of extradition to a man in his 40s asking him to report to the police station at the date and time set for him, a spokesman said.
Assange is still in violation of his bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he could face charges of espionage for publishing 250,000 US diplomatic documents on the website WikiLeaks.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 125 miles an hour with a hot drink between his legs.
A motorist was fined £1,000 for going up to 130mph with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was last seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink cup between his thighs.
At Colchester Magistrates Court, Howie pleaded guilty to charges of reckless and negligent driving.
He was given seven points to his name, which resulted in a six-month suspension.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of £90 and a surcharge of £100 for the defendant.
The London property bubble bursts as a result of the tax on foreign property owners
The Treasury has pre-calculated the tax on the return of financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7% real estate transfer fee for buildings over £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own properties within the company, not as individuals.
The revenue from the Housing Trust Fund transfer fee in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea boroughs, which reached £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: 'Given the increase in the transfer of real estate to high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is undertaxed regardless of the effect of the obsolete head tax system.'
He added that 'this move may have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy London properties, or existing owners to be reluctant to sell'.
Leading properties in the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price in the rich belt from Fulham to Wimbledon have seen a record 11.8% rise over the past year.
Prices in central London continue to show a steady year-on-year increase of 5.6%, but have been overshadowed by the booming 'domestic market', in which, according to a survey by Savills, the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) have experienced increases.
Scientists have shed more light on how tail movements are related to a dog's mood
Previous research has shown that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from a dog's perspective), while nervous dogs wag their tails predominantly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trento, said: "It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain have different connections to stimuli that elicit positive or negative emotions".
We've tried to find the same thing in other species.
He added that, as in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
In an effort to learn more about how dogs react to the disproportionate tail wagging of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It may not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes turn one way and sometimes the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: 'We showed the dogs films about dogs, either in a natural version or in silhouette, to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were also able to modify the tail movement to make it look more to the right or to the left.'
When the animals saw the otherwise inconspicuous dog wagging its tail to the right (from the viewpoint of a dog wagging its tail), they remained perfectly still.
But when she noticed that the tail was turned to the left (again from the viewpoint of a dog that was spinning its tail), their heart rate increased and the animals became uncertain.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think that dogs could consciously communicate with each other through these gestures.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they must and may not pay attention to.
He said, "If you encounter dogs repeatedly and the movement of their tails in one direction is repeatedly associated with more friendly behavior and the movement of the tails in the other direction produces less friendly behavior, you will respond based on that experience".
The researchers say the findings may help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers to better understand their animals' emotions.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a senior lecturer in veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides are important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog, and to the right when they see a happy dog.
And in another study from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, "Dogs were more likely to date a dog robot when it was wagging its tail to the left than to the right, when they were more likely to become uncertain, and exactly the opposite of the Italian study".
The difference, he says, may be that dogs in these different animal studies in movies or dog robots didn't behave quite like dogs.
He explained that studies of how dogs react to real dogs might help.
Although there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes in many different mammals, many details still need to be clarified  and dogs are no exception, he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won't take long to understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other.
The Arctic Monkeys have postponed their Glasgow concert due to Alex Turner's illness.
The Arctic Monkeys have postponed a Glasgow show after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band was supposed to perform at the Hydro City Complex on Friday.
But lead singer Alex Turner's illness forced her to postpone the show.
The announcement came after the band were similarly forced to postpone a Thursday gig at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone today's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and following medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone their performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, 1 November".
Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and unfortunately will not be able to perform.
The LG Arena in Birmingham will be held on 20 November and the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these performances remain valid.
We'd like to apologize to all those who purchased tickets for the inconvenience this has caused.
If you need further information, please contact the customer service department at the ticket office where you bought your tickets.
Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
The Vatican announced Thursday that Pope Francis will name new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
The cardinals are the highest ranking clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will establish his first group of men who will eventually help select his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope. Thus the group shrinks to 120 electing cardinals.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that the formal promotion of the new cardinals will be preceded by a gathering of the current cardinals known as the consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other gatherings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world", Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal voters is likely to fall by February.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as are needed to bring the number of electors back up to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
The consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe, Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance", he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose task it is to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope has decided everything for himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him", Valero said.
He said it was quite possible that these cardinals would be asked for advice by the Pope.
We've never been in this situation before. It's a new thing.
Valero said that popes have traditionally promoted bishops from high places to the position of cardinal, but Francis is "full of surprises" so we don't know who he's appointing.
GM is recalling some new light trucks in the U.S. for seat-back repairs.
According to Friday's announcement from the U.S. Automobile Safety Authority, General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to fix a manual-lock failure.
The front seat tilt mechanism may fail in some of these vehicles.
As a result, the seat backs do not conform to federal automobile safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website says that "if a vehicle is hit from behind, the head restraint may not protect the occupant properly, increasing the risk of injury".
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the vehicle in June and it is the most significant vehicle launch for the leading American automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring.
GM informed the owner of the van of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA couldn't review the owner's notice because of the 16-day government shutdown that weakened auto sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra vans that were redesigned for the 2014 model year rose about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverados and 16,503 Sierras from its fleet.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange were up 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
The desperate cry of Obama voters
I voted for Obama twice. I shared the hope that change was possible.
He says Obama's sincere efforts have been frustrated by Republican obstructionism.
Obstructionist politics cannot excuse the suffering of Obamacare websites or drone strikes.
The memoirs of the 2008 Obama campaign are a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is in his second year of medical school at Harvard.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would give me a little encouragement and a little hope during the dark days of my second year of medical school.
It's called "The Audacity to Win", and it's about the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reviews and go to bed at night, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in a landslide, and the news media forced us to reflect on the historical significance of this moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents were hiding the news they had obtained.
A young team of visionaries was headed to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
When he was elected in 2008, Obama had an 82 percent approval rating.
And here I close the book.
To move into the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It's hard to remember those optimistic days, but they seem like distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I cast my first ballot, things have really changed.
It was definitely not what I had imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied accomplishments from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that partisan obstruction has derailed so many of the efforts to move our nation forward, including immigration reform, public health care, and the closing of Guantanamo Bay.
But after many instances of defending the Obama administration in front of colleagues and friends, I've reached the absolute limit of the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
Republican obstruction can't explain the approval of wiretaps on foreign leaders or drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.
It doesn't explain the NSA's collection of data on the private lives of Americans, or its prosecution of those who expose government wrongdoing.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without due process, or for curtailing public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the finding of the report that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "more aggressive... than the Nixon administration".
And most recently, they can't even apologize for not being able to create a simple website more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed.
I don't know if something like this was to be expected.
Should I have known at 18 that the power of government could be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it?
The elected office obviously has no predictable course and our public debates will be shaped by the opposition political party and random events like the massacre in Newton.
However, all the examples I have given above seem to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unreasoned alternative and seemed unable to cement his policy or position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, would fulfill the hopes we had heard about.
Yet the return to 2008 is getting harder with Obama's support this week dropping below 45% through this book.
It reminds me of all the promises that have been lost.
I read a chapter in the book this week about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that they had to get back into the rhythm and stay true to their mission.
"I want our magic back", he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over the parental leave program.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over the parental leave programme because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
A mining tycoon who is in a dispute over the payment of a $6 million coal tax bill made this claim in an attempt to deflect the question of whether he had a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could be in a conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit personally from the policy.
'He got into a big conflict of interest with regard to paid parental leave because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether they got parental leave,' Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission, after a recount, officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the Fairfax County seat in the Sunshine Coast by 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the polls close?
"We need a better system", he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, type in details into the computer, vote instantly and have the results at half past seven?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballot papers.
Is it that the results can be rubbed off if someone doesn't like it?
In this day and age, using pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently released a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political programme also included the Sunshine Coast airports and that he would take his new job very seriously.
Public office is a public service.
"We seek no reward other than to be able to serve the community at this critical time", he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have found that washing your hands actually changes your mood.
Ninety-eight people were divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an unsolvable problem.
Of course, both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after the failure was much more optimistic than the group that didn't wash their hands.
The "washed-hands" group also performed better than the other group in the next test.
Still, those who washed their hands scored worse on other tests than those who didn't.
The results of the washed out were at the level of the third group, whose participants had no previous failure.
The results of the test, according to psychologists, indicate that physical cleanliness does indeed remove negative feelings after failure.
But at the same time, the motivation goes down, and the test subjects have to concentrate much more in the next exams.
If we transferred the results of the research to the Czech Republic, we would be most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs do not wash their hands, but after using public transport, the number is already one fifth.
Hygiene is also commonly observed after gardening or working in a workshop, where 85 percent of the people wash their hands.
A pet's caress is the motivation for 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that Czechs and Slovaks differ in their perception of the need to wash their hands after shaking hands with a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I fear that the reality is different and people are trying to make themselves a little bit better", said dermatologist Klaudie Komárková, commenting on the survey results.
RBS suspends two foreign currency dealers
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two dealers in its foreign exchange division, another sign that global investigations by regulators into suspected currency manipulation are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are cooperating with the competent authorities in their investigation of the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders mentioned would be the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expanding investigation, which is a response to the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our relentless investigation into this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities", the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the matter said that RBS had provided the UK Financial Conduct Authority with records of emails and instant messages sent from and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been relieved from his current position as European head of foreign exchange trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European head of cash trading at Citi, took a leave of absence this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Mr. Usher's instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people familiar with the matter said.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss supervisory authority Finma announced it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market machinations at several Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide - the European Commission, Finma, Swiss antitrust authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating allegations that these bankers have colluded to manipulate the currency market.
In addition, people familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had launched internal investigations or received requests for information from the competent authorities.
Banks have been combing through years of old instant messages and emails to find instances of wrongdoing.
Reports of the investigations have alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the biggest engines for profit-making in investment banks' closing hours in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the fact that little currency volatility has limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the gravity of the situation by claiming that a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-level traders say that may not necessarily be true.
A senior trader said that despite the significant volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks, increasing the use of their own internal platforms, meant that "you can start to influence the market at relatively low prices".
The news comes on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired from its stock trading department this week a trader who had caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and is cooperating with their supervisory authorities.
"We believe that the trader acted alone and that the problem has been resolved", said Credit Suisse.
The number of HIV-infected in Prague has exceeded 1,000
Doctors in Prague have registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the study in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of this year, tests confirmed infection in a total of 1,005 people in the metropolitan area.
This is according to statistics from the National AIDS Reference Laboratory of the National Institutes of Health.
According to her, there have been 2,063 cases in the whole of the Czech Republic so far.
396 of the immunodeficiency diseases have already broken out.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year for the past decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed 50 cases, and five years later, 121 cases.
In 2009, the investigation revealed 156 new cases and in 2010 it revealed 180.
Last year, it was down to 153, but last year it was a record.
The lab says there were 212.
"I think there is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year", says Miroslav Hlavatý, an AIDS expert who for years led the Prague Lighthouse for Patients.
From October to the end of 2011, tests detected infection in 39 people, and last year in 47, Hlavatý said.
In September, doctors enrolled 21 new patients and three female patients.
From the start of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has struck 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
If you really want to know a city, you should go to the graveyard.
A visit to it will reveal more than a stroll through the bustling center of monuments, churches, and galleries, more than a bed-sitting will reveal.
Many people "read from the graves".
They slowly roam the cemetery, gaining an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities they are, what religions they have, how big and tight families they belong to, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, what their tastes are.
And they'll learn from the condition of the graves how the dead care for their remains.
The Supreme Court upheld the Obama health care law
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care law signed by Barack Obama is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
In a 5-4 decision, the court ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or face a fine, is not unconstitutional under the government's taxing authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also upheld the remaining parts of the 2700-page law and further ruled that the statutory health care requirement, which mandates states to expand access to health insurance, otherwise threatening to forfeit all federal health insurance funding, is not enforceable and unconstitutional.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Businesses to block the law.
During the 2012 primary, the law was vigorously opposed by each of the major Republican candidates, including the presumptive nominee, Mitt Romney.
For saying "Mugabe is a lame-ass" there is no longer any jail time, the court has struck down the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to be careful about how they speak publicly about the 89-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980's and since the end of 1987.
Under Article 33 of the Penal Code, contempt of the office of the president was punishable by a fine of $100 and up to one year in prison.
"State representatives should not zealously accuse people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places", said the representatives of the Constitutional Court.
Nine justices unanimously agreed that the law undermined free speech.
The government is likely to appeal the court's decision, reported the BBC in Britain.
A number of Zimbabweans who have been harmed by the law have spoken out against it, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in a bar fight with a police officer.
In May, an opposition activist who publicly called Mugabe a "balding donkey" ended up in jail.
Then in August, the prosecutor charged a 26-year-old man with the intent to use a poster of Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared the law to be unconstitutional, restricting freedom of the media.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements later turn out to be false", said Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe's law has allowed for a 20-year prison sentence for publishing false information.
"The existence of a law that allows for criminalising someone for making false statements has a chilling effect on the right to freedom of expression", Malala added.
Despite Mugabe's rule of the country for over 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution in March, based on a referendum, with broader civil liberties.
The country took a small step towards one-man dictatorship in 2009 when a deal between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangirai to the premiership.
Nevertheless, the country continues to suffer from economic crisis and until 2008, the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government abolished the national currency altogether.
Today, Zimbabweans are only allowed to pay in other countries' currencies.
The crippled economy is going to the rack for Mugabe's ill-advised agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed white farmer land between his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience of farming.
Central banks will maintain swap lines indefinitely
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool to enable banks to access global currencies whenever they need to.
The banks stated this in their joint statement.
"It's a very sensible move", commented Julian Callow, chief economist at Barclays, a London-based international bank.
"So far, all the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so I don't think it's a surprise", adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are reinforcing the ties that began to form in 2007, when the international credit market first froze.
Central bank revenues gave access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The central bankers' decision comes as the US Fed prepares to end its program of supporting the US economy, which could prevent the price of money in the global market from rising further.
A swap contract is normally used to overcome a liquidity shortfall of one currency when there is a liquidity surplus of another currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of another.
The ECB is launching its third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How does Tipsport (not) erase personal data?
Over a year ago, I registered on the site Tipsport.cz.
But I didn't finish it because someone at the branch couldn't finish the online registration.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, my registration failed, and then I moved, and that changed my address and my ID number.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it was not possible because I had a different OP number, address and that it simply could not be completed and that I should ask for data to be erased and make a new registration.
So I did that, and on October 24, 2013, I wrote to tech support asking for all my personal data to be deleted from the database under the applicable data protection law.
The other day, I got a text from tech support saying I had to finish the registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of e-mails to tech support, where finally after the fourth hurricane on October 25th, they said that their personal data had been deleted at my request.
So you would think that you could do that new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it is not personal data, but in the end they also discarded this).
So I used a different username and it popped up that my personal data was already stored to complete the registration on the branch (how can they have stored something they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted the technical support again.
When I asked how it could be, they said that the personal data had been deleted on October 25th, and I was told to send an e-mail with the error.
I did (around 3 pm yesterday) and they wrote back today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 1.22 pm and that that's why it can't be done because I used the same name and date of birth.
What if I've been contacting tech support for a week and I'm still telling them it's not working?
And what if what they say is true (as it is not) no one could register with the same name or the same date of birth if it is already registered.
By the way, at 1:22 p.m., I actually registered, with the same name and date of birth, but I used a fake e-mail and phone number, and, you know, a page popped up that said they sent me a link to complete the registration.
But how is that possible if you can't register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport tied the registration to an e-mail and a phone number and the data just didn't match up as they claimed.
So again, I told the tech support that they were just lying (either intentionally or they didn't know what they were saying) because what they were saying wasn't true.
I've logged several screenshots that the registration issue was already there before October 31st, so the "fake" registration simply doesn't affect this.
Tipsport responded with a straightforward, "I'm sorry, but since you're re-registered, we can't verify your claim".
And he cut off communication.
It repeats the same sentence over and over again, that registration is tied to name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration wasn't completed by clicking on that link in the email, and so it didn't actually happen.
So, to sum it up, Tipsport not only hasn't deleted the data as they claim, but they're lying when they say they haven't.
What's worse is that they're easily proven to be lying and they try to make it look like the fault is on the customer's side.
By the way, after I posted this on my personal blog, things started to move a little bit and I got an email from Tech Support that they were handing the matter over for review and I would be informed (after a week of urgency and debate and the same bug being pointed out).
♪ There's music on the subway ♪ ♪ On the bridge ♪
The Prague Transport Company (DPP) has launched the project Music in the Metro.
The first vestibule, where the reproduced instrumental music plays continuously during the operation of the metro, is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The trial run will last six months.
Michal Horáček presented his new double album, band and three singers
The composer Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Cologne City Social House not only his brand new double CD Czech Calendar, but especially in the program Among Us singers Lenka Nova, Františka Segrada and Ondra Rumla accompanied by the excellent Orchestra of Matěje Benka.
After the opening intro and theatrical eudition about the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, himself coming with a candle in his hand and recalling the story about how they last played in Cologne and in the theater and the whole city lost electricity.
"In Cologne, there were two types of cards that I had a lot of contact with", he recalled.
He also reminded me of President Zeman's hometown.
"Maybe we could do a tour of Zákolány or Dubravka near Bratislava", he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times during the evening, Horace, who never left the stage and, if he didn't speak, sat at the bar with a glass of wine, touched his new musical instrument.
Josef Mánes also made the calendar, he put it on the clock, about ice hockey but he had no idea how we gather in those squares and chant, who does not jump, is not Czech.
"That's the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we won't play it here tonight", he said.
But Ondra Ruml said that this record was very suitable for him to sleep in the day, sing at night and accompanied by her on the guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, he played the percussion, all three singers then accompanied the band in the composition of keyboard, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists sang a little bit of the "Do the side of the heart" song together, which immediately broke up the nursery.
"I'm glad that you liked the song, which did not surprise me in Kmokh's city", responded Michal Horáček.
After the memory of Peter Hapk, the song "I recognize you" by František Segrad, originally by Richard Müller, was awarded with a huge applause, while Han Heger recalled the song "Dad liked Lida Baarova" with Horáček's explanation of the communist ban and the replacement of Baar by the American actress Mae West.
Composer Michael Kocába was reminded of the song Sebastián, then Segrado sang a wonderful song Praha, set to music by Jardou Svoboda, a native of Damm and former Kolínák.
And that was the end of it, a standing ovation and an optimistic song, "We Live in Wonderful Times".
There was one more song ready to be added to the playlist, but the fans didn't cheer.
Almost immediately after the concert, the entire quartet sat down at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček's books and even the cover of the legendary LP and even took photos with any interested parties.
Berdycha and Štěpánek will be joined by Rosol and Hájek
In the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the non-playing captain of the Czech tennis team, Jaroslav Navrátil, nominated the four: Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech representatives are defending the trophy, but they will play on the home court of the rival in the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in five years.
"We know we're going to hot ground, that it's going to be wild, and we have to focus on our performance as always".
"We're going there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best", said Štěpánek, who scored the winning point in last year's final against Spain.
The secret wars of Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
The American command in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have exactly demonstrated what bombing Syria should look like.
Without any fanfare, threats or millions of statements, they sent out planes, they hit the target and they came back.
Without being swayed by official chemical weapons removal in Syria.
They're refusing to confirm the whole thing and they're not commenting on it.
The exact opposite of the confused and grandiloquent, unchallenged actions of Obama's Syria policy.
And the most satisfying part of the whole attack was the thing that the Israelis bombed.
Don't be fooled by the media's claims that it was bombed "Syrian base" or "supplies for Hezbollah".
I recently wrote here that while the US aid to the secular rebels in the country remains only rhetorical, Russia is happily continuing to supply Syria with weapons.
And a fresh shipment of Russian missiles, unloaded at the port of Latakia, was the target of an Israeli air strike.
The message is clear.
And notice, Israel again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, even though popular Internet theories say the opposite.
The U.S. government has flagged two members of the Space Force, possibly Delta Force.
Unknown until now, they were featured in the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.
There's a well-known heroic death of two former SEALs who were defending a CIA compound in the city, I believe they were members of a secret CIA task force made up of former military personnel.
There's been a lot of speculation about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at another CIA residence.
It's clearer now.
Anyway, the information that the CIA has a machine gun nest in Libya, and that both SEALs were killed by a mortar attack on one of them, is rather surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two unsung heroes.
They were part of the American commando unit in Tripoli, and as soon as they got word of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and along with five private contractors, they fired their way into the CIA compound in Benghazi.
The Obama administration blames the fact that during the attack, the commandos were not even officially deployed and were just hesitant about what to do.
The commander, without orders, will probably release these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that there are not one-time, but permanent American commandos, CIA agents and private contractors operating in the country is quite interesting information.
And that's because until recently, there was no official acknowledgement of any such thing, and even now, all we're talking about is some kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's good that the U.S. is doing a half-hearted job of fighting terrorism in Libya.
Although, to solve the nationwide situation, it would require a much larger help.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It wasn't that long ago that the media almost singled out the Iranian Air Force for chasing down American drones.
Little is known, however, about how effectively the Americans protect their drones.
Of course, if he happens to find his drone in the air, there's nothing you can do about it.
But if an Iranian drone is spotted in international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that an Iranian F-4 Phantom jet chased a U.S. drone in international sea space, in what may have been the first-ever, high-intensity deployment of an American F-22 Raptor super fighter.
He flew the Phantom to optically inspect its equipment without the Phantom registering it on the radar or even noticing it, and then when he suddenly appeared and challenged the Iranian pilot to return home, he obeyed without a murmur.
No wonder the Phantom is an American-made aircraft, but it remembers the Vietnam War.
He's no match for the Raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team is not doing well in the results recently, defender or midfielder Viktorie Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that brought him back to the national team after a year.
He's also a good shooter, he's a very active player, and he was given a penalty kick in the Teplice game after the surgery.
Victoria had a winning streak in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice, but in the end, she took only one point from those two duels.
František Rajtoral believes his team will break an unpleasant series against Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we can beat the Apple team at home", promises František Rajtoral.
The men are carefully preparing for a tough match against the Northern Czechs, who play offensive football.
Everything is going to the match with Jablonce, the coach is preparing us well, as always we are getting a lot from the video game design of the opponent.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night", the Czech representative invites fans to the Doosan Arena.
The last two matches didn't go as well as she would have liked, but the word of crisis is on Victoria's side.
That's football. Sometimes you're in good shape, sometimes you're in bad shape.
But I wouldn't talk about a crisis under any circumstances.
"I believe we'll win on Friday and it'll be good again", says the Westeros defender.
The men of Victoria will once again rely on the support of the fans.
"It's Friday night, and I'd like to invite our fans, who are great, to come".
"I believe we will reward them with a win", Rajtoral adds.
Step back from the bench.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, but a big leap -- a leap back a few years, and that's to my childhood memories.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come home from school and do the dishes and the laundry and do the homework.
Even though these "duties" were mostly just theories, wishes of the parents.
The practice was completely different - to run in from school, throw the bag in the corner and run out.
Play ball games with the other kids, jump shotgun.
Then on the show, Helena and her boys sew a chain stitch on a big day tablecloth for Grandma's birthday.
And then, after several warnings, wash the dishes, flush the dishes, put wood in the fireplace in the winter, and do homework until after dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and write love poems to school sweetheart instead of homework).
In the morning, we'd have homemade strawberry jam (with real fruit, not the jams they sell now, which are not even strawberries) and drink it with tea made from dried herbs that my mother and I loved to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a dead silence in the bedroom, when my sister and I would record songs from the radio to cassette tapes that were playing loudly in the old cassette player my mother had left.
And then we would just re-roll the tapes and play the same song over and over again, our favorite song, and then we would siphon it.
Or we would make phone calls over the table with the help of cans tied together by a string - and, speaking of phone calls, to hear each other better, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, our earmuffs then being cork + cotton.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents could live on it without any problems.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPads or even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes.
Clothing was passed down from generation to generation, and the best wardrobe accessory was a batik-made T-shirt made in-house by SAVA.
From the electronics, we were satisfied with the above-mentioned cassette recorder of my mother and, at best, the Walkman, which my sister and I shared, and which we used anyway only on the train on the school trip.
We thought it would be more interesting to play with Aunt Hattie Hop or Man, Don't Be Mad, or as I said, just go outside.
When I was a little older, we got a VCR under the tree, which my parents had been saving for a long time, but unfortunately it didn't last long.
My little sister had a strudel in him, and she said he was so good at playing those tapes, so she tried to see if he could play strudel.
Unfortunately, he did, but it was his last bite.
Well, that's the story he's still got, poor thing, on his dad's plate.
She says that when Lenka was little, she put a strudel in the video and thought it would play her a recipe and it didn't, which is why she still can't bake it.
I remember when we were able to communicate with each other, to talk to each other without cell phones, without computers.
My sister and I had arranged with the granddaughter of our neighbor to meet again next summer at her grandmother's house - and that was the way it was, and so it was.
We got together.
Promise someone you'll see them in a year?!
I also remember the winter when we used to run outside with the whole village, building snowmobiles, riding on the snow-covered hill by the church on sacks filled with snow.
Afterward, we had a family meal together, talking about the day.
Of course, before each meal, my sister and I would hear the notorious phrase, "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but I'm sure you don't have any soap in a lemon net tied to the faucet in your bathroom.
After dinner, while Dad was "working" in the garage over beer with Jarda from the village, Mom and I lay on the floor, put our feet against the pitch-black fireplace, opened the door, looked at the flame, and listened to the crackling of the wood as it fell from the stone.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many social network friends we had, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated -- we talked -- we didn't text each other every day, chat, text.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew so much more about each other.
And I could go on and on.
It's nice to remember, especially if I supplement those memories by looking at albums where the neatly glued black corners evoke black and white photos.
And if I don't happen to know how old I was, the year of the photo is always written on the back.
I see that although the cut-offs didn't fit us very well and we had cousin's pants two sizes bigger, no one had ever laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather take that step back to reality.
By 2013, and I'll be waiting to see what modern times will invent for my kids.
What I know for sure is that these memories of mine are for the younger generation of teenagers now at least somewhere "a hundred years behind the ape" and I think they are missing a lot, that they will not live this "pre-ape" time too.
I wish they did!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over patents owned by Nortel
A group that owns thousands of defunct Nortel patents filed a patent infringement suit Thursday against mobile phone makers including Google, the company it outbid in Nortel's bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in a US district court in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is being accused of infringing seven patents.
The patents include technology that helps link Internet search terms to the relevant advertisement, the lawsuit says, which is at the core of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are all making phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is in strong competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a $900 million initial bid for Nortel's patents.
Google increased its bid several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent battle to Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal that was motivated in part by Motorola's patent pool.
Despite its failure to obtain the disputed patents at auction, Google infringed and continues to infringe the patents,the complaint states.
Rockstar seeks increased compensation from Google because it claims that Google is intentionally infringing the patent, as the plaintiff claims.
Miloslava Cejpková: The November Smile is the first of its kind in the Czech Republic.
It came from outside, from a four-degree Celsius temperature that we're not used to.
First, she put away the smile that she had always displayed as a defense against the seemingly friendly environment.
She was very relieved, because it was a mask she decided not to wear in public.
He was only honest at home on days when she was babysitting and had her grandchildren around, Elinka or Adik.
And, of course, when her sons called.
She remembered the lessons of endless business skills classes.
Now they're finally really useful.
To spare the grief of those closest to her.
Then he flew into a corner.
It's like a costume party.
November, no other month can do the miracle of making her smile like that time they were on a trip with the one who's been gone for almost three years.
Egypt inaugurates its first freely elected president
Muhammad Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his triumphant day will only bring political unrest to Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was inaugurated as the country's first freely elected president since Husni Mubarak was deposed 16 months earlier.
In taking office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before 18 judges dressed in black talers in a mansion built overlooking the Nile that resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic", Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"The Egyptian people today have laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability", said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of fierce attacks by governments for most of its 84 years as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived shortly after 11:00 local time in a small convoy of cars, hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential pomp of Mubarak's era, traffic was only briefly stopped to allow the convoy to pass through the usually busy road linking the city center to the suburbs to the south.
The personal prestige of Morsi, derisively dubbed the uncharismatic "spare tire" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has risen sharply since his victory and his Friday speech, which was intended to present him as the candidate not only of Islamists but also of all those who want to end the rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state today", Mursi, dressed in a blue civil suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wood-lined chamber where he took the oath.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to deliver his inaugural address.
While standing by, he was given an official welcome by the military band, which played the national anthem.
The military commander, Field Marshal Husain Tantawi, was brought in.
His arrival was accompanied by the cheers of the army and the people, one hand out of the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Cairo University was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later became a bastion of the Islamic student movement in the 1970s.
Morsi took the symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and solemnly promised to resume the presidential powers taken from him by the military council, which took them from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take an oath of office before the court, rather than before Parliament, as is customary, he has submitted to the will of the army, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There'll be police specialists in the ghettos to ease the tension.
In the Czech ghettos, police specialists should be deployed in the future.
They'd spend half their commute here.
They would keep order and solve problems.
Their knowledge of the environment should help reduce tensions between people from poor areas and neighbouring communities.
The Home Office is considering this in its proposal to reduce security risks.
According to him, the main thing that would help the country to improve its situation would be "the accelerated provision of social housing".
The document was negotiated by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poorhouses and slums in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
They were home to 80,000 people, mainly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
She was a flower.
According to experts in troubled areas, 100 have been added since then.
Relations between their inhabitants and the rest of the world are heightened.
Anti-Roman marches were held in several places.
People from the surrounding area joined the extremists.
According to the Interior, it's difficult for the police to maintain security and order in ghetto areas.
The essential condition is, it says, "the consistent application of equal treatment in law enforcement".
But they say that without a thorough knowledge of the place and the people, it's impossible to achieve that.
A Specialist would go to the ghetto marches, where he would spend half of his service, the rest of his service in his district.
He'd be in charge of the order in a troubled area.
He would also know the locals, so he could handle problems or misdemeanors better.
"Thanks to the trust built, specialists will be able to more easily prevent a whole range of wrongdoing", the insider said.
Specialists in the ghettos would receive bonuses, between 500 and 1,000 crowns a month.
The deployment of special police officers to troubled areas is to be paid for from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros.
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the amount, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations started this year, and a detailed proposal is now being worked on.
The project is scheduled to run until 2016.
The writers were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem of socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements", the report authors stated.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not clear yet.
The answer is to be found in an analysis that identifies the areas where a special police officer might be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year for these officers after the project is over.
According to the draft, the selected police officers will first undergo a training course in Slovakia.
Fifty members should be trained annually.
They'll be the most suitable candidates.
Special training should also be provided for police officers who will be working in the ghettos.
The authors believe that social housing would be the main way to improve the situation.
It's supposed to motivate and lead to integration.
According to the interior design, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would be accommodation with well-defined rules, such as the number of people per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
The standard would be higher in social housing, which would be comparable to conventional housing.
Tenants would have to follow an integration plan drawn up with them by social workers.
They would have to maintain their housing, take care of their health, send their children to school, retrain, and actively seek employment.
If they were to seek inclusion, they would be upgraded to a higher standard of living.
The system of progressive housing should, according to the interior, work for at least 30 years, until the next generation grows up "in a pro-integration-motivated environment".
The model of social housing is prepared by the local development and employment authorities.
They're supposed to have it out by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: The Coal Mound - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The Uřřběl hill is a prominent hill 3 km southeast of Bruntal.
Along with several others, the evidence of volcanic activity in the Low Jeseník is recent (from a geological point of view).
The last eruptions here were at the beginning of the Quaternary.
When viewed from a greater distance, the Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Help, built between 1755 and 1765, is conspicuously white-painted on the top of the Uhlířský hill.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The innkeeper, who was standing next to the church, was not behaving.
Shortly after the church was completed, a four-lane alley was laid, about 1 km long.
The third version of the Way of the Cross on the Uhlířské vrch is already here, the original one was built in 1916, the second one, from 2001, lasted only until 2004.
At 15 stops, there are wooden sculptures made by local artist František Nedomlel.
He used different types of wood from the Low Autumn region.
Likewise, the rock substrates of the area form an interesting geological exposition.
Each stop is also identified by the name of the sponsor.
The Carboniferous Peak is the remnant of a young volcano.
Although radiometric dating varies somewhat, the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Red (at 3.3 million years old) and older than the Venus volcano (0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born of an explosion.
It spewed out a considerable amount of volcanic ash, along with fragments of rock from the floor, which had a reddish-brown color when burned.
At the end of this phase, lava - today's layer of porous silt - gushed out to the surface, up to 40 feet [13 m] thick.
The second eruption produced red, brown, and sometimes black plumes.
Their layer is up to 50 meters thick and part of it is accessible in the quarry wall.
The second eruption also ended with a lava flow.
At the end of the activity, lava has escaped from the volcano, which today forms a layer of strusciform sediment up to 50 m thick.
Volcanoes that alternate volcanic ash ejections with lava flows are the most common type of volcano.
Because they're actually made up of layers, they're called stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone gradually eroded.
But it was threatened by the mining of the southern face.
The most intensive mining took place between 1953 and 1962.
Tuffs were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The mining was stopped under pressure from experts and the public, and this unique site was preserved.
The problem is the porosity and small cohesion of the rocks, which are quickly weathering, breaking up and sliding down the slope.
The smoke is disappearing pretty fast.
To complicate matters, the warm, south-facing slope is ideal for some rare plant and animal species.
Correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained at a number of important locations.
The coal mountain is reached by the green tourist sign from Bruntal, or from Slezsky Koch.
Motorists can use the free parking at the beginning of the lip avenue, where the short scientific trail also begins.
She moved from the villa to the boarding house.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a mansion with a garden and a pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa districts on Ořechovce.
However, the original owners got the house back in restitution, and the tenants had to move out with a small severance.
So Ivana quickly sought a replacement home for herself and her elderly mother.
She got a tip from a friend about a 3+2 apartment in an older panel house on the other side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the vast forest park and the dam on the other side excited me", Ivana recalls the first impression.
At first I thought it was a temporary arrangement for three years.
"We have lived here for more than 13 years now and I would not change our house just for the gradual reconstruction", adds the owner.
The mother and daughter had moved from their 1,300-square-foot apartment to a smaller one, and they had given away almost all their furniture.
It wasn't easy, the stuff was stored at friends' houses, and it took almost a year to gradually get it all set up.
The new apartment was in fairly good condition, but necessary alterations had to be made, such as painting the doors and replacing the windows.
The previous owner had drilled the core, but the owner was most impressed with the impractical and unnecessarily large vestibule, and the small bathroom, on the other hand.
The two rooms are joined together to create a multi-functional living space.
The architects used plasterboard to define the zones and to organize the room, which allowed for the repositioning of the lights.
The first intervention she made in a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained an airy atmosphere and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step in the partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of PVC flooring with laminate.
Ivan was in a bad mood with the bathroom.
I've been collecting housing magazines for years, looking for inspiration.
I recently discovered an interesting realization in one of them.
So I asked a young architect named Kamil Douděrová for a recommendation.
"It was actually the most important step into the future", says Ivan.
The bathroom was remodeled to accommodate the front room.
The architect merged the toilet and bathroom spaces and replaced the two doors with sliding doors, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently unobstructed.
The quality floors are made to imitate a sandstone, the shower is made to sit comfortably, and the toilet has a bidet shower.
The successful collaboration with Kamil Douděrová continued.
In the program How to Build a Dream, a quick but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin Čeněk also participated.
In the space that was created by connecting two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and spaces, without the help of the classical principles of optical partitioning, such as the half-way or Japanese walls.
"This would in effect violate the openness and unity of the space", explains the architect.
They managed to separate the sleeping and the living areas in an original way.
All you had to do was turn the two sofas back to back and put a custom-made bed sheet box between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and the paintwork.
The architect used high-quality marble for the kitchen floor and dining area, and she brought the sliding doors to life with patterned wallpaper.
The kitchen counter shall be covered by sliding wallpaper panels if necessary.
The new anti-allergic marble floor has a number of advantages over the previous laminate floor: a softer non-slip surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of niches and sub-panels made of cardboard, highlighted by colour, is an example of how space can be worked in a panel.
I left the colors to the architects, I wanted it to be joyful.
"I like orange, it was the same color in my previous apartment", says Ivana.
The glass backing with the motif of a flowering magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To create a warm, energetic tone, the architects chose white, which emphasized a modern, functional style.
In the small apartment, books were stored, among other things, in the space under the window sill.
Everything is within reach, the lights are comfortably controlled remotely.
The new interior is perfectly balanced by the old, such as the decades-old crystal chandelier and the fine artwork that Ivana has collected throughout her life.
The kitchen was the last to go.
The lockers used to be placed on either side, and the owner felt like she was in a tunnel.
The architect took the number and rearranged the layout.
The furniture in the simple design is made to order, the white panel softens the slightly pearly surface.
The small space was made possible by the ingenious design of the washing machine, the dryer, and the washing machine.
The small kitchen was brought to life by a fully glazed wall over the counter.
The unique stained glass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, and it is also very well maintained.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers to remind her of her favorite neighborhood, where she lived for years.
Now she seems happy here.
The original bathroom had a small tub and a sink, but the new owner chose a neutral shade of lace.
The big shower corner has a glass door, Ronald.
The challenge was to create a clear, simple space in which functions and devices could be in harmony.
We've unified the interior in material and color and tried to make it elegant, cozy, not too cluttered.
"Another condition for the award was a barrier-free solution with minimal obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and accessibility of everyday items", adds Kamila Douděrová.
The Supreme Court has ruled: Necessity can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečase can be prosecuted for any crimes he may have committed before the August dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies.
He was protected only by the procedural immunity applicable to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS members Ivana Fuks, Marka Šnajdra and Petr Tluchoře, the court ruled that they could not be punished for possible criminal offences until they gave up their parliamentary mandate last November, Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig said.
By this decision, the Court of First Instance rejected the request of the Prosecutor Iva Ištvan to continue the criminal proceedings against the Members.
He said they accepted bribes in the form of lucrative positions in state-owned companies in exchange for giving up their mandate and not making trouble for the passage of laws.
Instead, the former prime minister who offered them these positions can be prosecuted.
With Vitek Barta, an officer of the anti-corruption police was also detained
Barto's lawyer Oldřich Chudoba, who represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV MPs, also did not want to comment much on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this case, but due to the protection of classified facts I can not comment further".
According to information from Práva, the case is being handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS).
Server tn.cz reported that Bárta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the first-instance.cz server, the case may be related to the cause of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment to the post Bárta allegedly sought.
But the latest information from the Prosecutor's Office indicates that the detention of Vit Barta is not related to Peter Lessi.
Police spokeswoman Eva Kropáčová declined to comment on the matter, saying that the case is being handled by the Prague Municipal Office.
"We will not comment on this question in order to protect classified information", said the spokeswoman for the City Prosecutor's Office in Prague, Štěpánka Zenklová, on Friday.
It is the prosecutor there who is overseeing Bart's case, and it follows from her words that the file or the criminal proceedings are being conducted under a secret mode.
A reporter from Novinek managed to reach the wife of Vit Bárta, Katerina Klasnova, in front of their home on the Prague Klárovka.
She was just loading the bags into the car and driving away.
She declined to comment on the incident.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn Movement, Tomio Okamura, commented on Bart's arrest.
He says he has no idea what the case is about.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties for our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not and is not a member of the Direct Democracy Dawn of Tomia Okamura", he added.
Vít Bárta, who unsuccessfully stood for Tomí Okamura's direct democracy movement in the last early elections to the Chamber of Deputies in Plzeň County, is known for his corrupt case of bribing members of the Public Affairs Committee.
In April 2012, he was illegally sentenced to 18 months suspended to 30 months.
The verdict was later reversed, and Bart was acquitted of the charges.
I want an NHL contract.
♪ I still have the juice, the lust, the excitement ♪
Family has always been the most important thing to Prospa, and at 38 years of age, she wants to obey it completely.
Either he gets a job overseas and continues his career, or he's out of hockey for good.
"I want to be a husband and a father".
"I'm looking forward to it", says a hockey player who is still waiting in vain for an offer.
Despite being a famous hard worker who never screws up.
Despite the fact that he leaves his heart on the ice every time, and he can take out his teammates.
And despite the fact that he was Columbus' most productive player last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still in me", she says firmly.
He may be, as he's reportedly being courted by the New York Rangers, who have been unable to make the postseason, and have two injured forwards, Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
How's it going with you coming to Rangers?
It's all speculation.
Until I have something on paper, it's not worth bothering with.
I know there was a story in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere else is it ever said that this really happened.
I'm sorry, I'd like to announce that I have a contract, but I don't.
You haven't heard from the club?
This is the kind of communication that goes on in the NHL every day.
The point is to get into a situation where the contract actually comes.
When a player gets hurt or someone else doesn't make it and the club doesn't work.
There's a lot of different factors that have to come together to get me this contract.
But New York is a similar situation, isn't it?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't make the postseason, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always that chance.
The second thing is, you always need two sides to do that.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten any yet.
That's the reality I have to live with.
You're flying to America on Friday, expecting something to go wrong?
I've had these expectations since July 5th, when the NHL opened the free agent market, and still nothing.
You're going to New York to remember?
I'm going to Tampa to see my kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sunshine and seeing you again.
Do you have a schedule of your own?
It's because I'm a father and a husband, and it's all coming from that.
I'm not a hockey player at the moment - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna be a dad and a husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
There are two hockey games on Sunday, and it's a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go and support our kids in what they want to do.
You ever think about doing this on a full-time basis?
Yeah, well, you can think about a lot of things.
That can happen.
I tried it out three years ago when I missed 50 games because of knee surgery.
And I had a lot of fun.
There comes a point where all the goals, wins and passes won't make up for what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's what life is all about.
You can have any job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL just because it's NHL, or is it because of family that you want to be in America?
As a hockey player, my first priority - besides family - is athletic success.
The NHL is the best league in the world.
And that's where family life comes from.
My children, sorry, our children - my children and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there and so on.
And we would love to see them continue that trend.
Because, whatever we tell ourselves, in America, the possibilities are elsewhere.
We should give them that chance.
So you're planning to stay in America permanently?
We'll practice like this until then.
That means we'll be in the Czech Republic in the summer in Hluboká and the surroundings of Český Budějovice.
And in the winter, in Tampa, or wherever our steps take us.
It's perfect, being warm.
I've been very lucky in my life.
You could say that going to meet him took a lot of strength and a lot of penance and a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey has given me a lot of opportunities in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who are craving this, to be able to choose what they want to do and how they want to live.
How long at your age will you have the will to work hard, train hard and wait for an offer?
Yeah, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have that in me today, that drive, that drive, that enthusiasm, that passion for the sport, that desire and that drive to prove to people that you still have the NHL, that I'm still better than anybody else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna stay there.
You can't plan that.
So, you're saying this season you're gonna wait and see how it plays out and then decide what to do next?
I'm in the phase where I go from day to day.
The CEO of ČEZ recently announced that he was postponing the decision on the construction of the third and fourth units of the Temelín plant until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Concept and the approval of the Contracts of difference by the government.
The Commission notes that the main shareholders of ČEZ are the State and the State-owned banks.
But a qualified manager should give shareholders recommendations, not hide behind them.

Police have evacuated a section of Los Angeles International Airport due to the shooting.
Shots fired this morning at Los Angeles International Airport.
Police have evacuated a section of the airport, reportedly Terminal 3.
Reuters, citing California media, says law enforcement officers shot and killed an armed man.
The Los Angeles Times, citing police, reported that there was a shootout in which two to three members of the Transportation Security Administration were injured.
How many people were injured and if there are any casualties, it is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about incidents with a higher number of injuries.
Israel has bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was supposed to be the Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli warplanes on Thursday reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia.
Citing an unnamed U.S. government official, CNN reported.
The Israeli press has widely reported the explosion at the alleged missile depot, but the Israeli government has not confirmed the attack.
A spokesman for the Israeli military declined to comment on the raid.
"We do not comment on news from foreign media", she said.
The target of the Israeli airstrike, according to a US government source, was a missile and related equipment that the Israelis believe could be transported to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.
The Associated Press, citing another U.S. security official, reported that the target of the Israeli strike on a target in Syria was a Russian SA-125 missile.
Channel 2 Israeli TV reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly advanced Syrian air defense system.
But satellite imagery of the area of the attack, according to the DPA, showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles.
He also said that they were showing SA-3 missile batteries, including a command center with radar to track missiles and their targets.
The missiles recorded have a range of 35 kilometers and could carry 70 kilograms of warheads, according to an Israeli TV report.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, according to CNN and the AP.
The Israeli military has never reacted to such reports, but has repeatedly stated that it will intercept any weapons shipment destined for Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its estimate of annual profit and is expecting record profits from its recreational properties in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual basic profit before tax to be between USD 325 and 340 million, compared to USD 305 to 315 million in the previous forecast.
If current trends continue, this would represent a 12 to 17 percent increase over the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
Chief Executive Graham Turner said that Flight Centre had made an eight per cent profit in the first half and the second half had started with a surge in non-business travel, particularly in Australia and the UK.
"As of today, our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record annual profits before interest and tax", he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are traditionally our biggest profit-makers.
The leisure business in Australia recovered during the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the leisure sector, while corporate clients spent less.
The US trade has recovered from a loss during the seasonally weak half and is expected to deliver its third consecutive full-year profit.
Flight Centre shares were up 3 cents yesterday at $38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia are being transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September for protesting against planned oil drilling in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported today by AFP, citing the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
It also claims that the original charges against its activists for piracy have not yet been withdrawn.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the Arctic oil platform have been transferred from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg", the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA, it was a planned relocation.
Environmental authorities initially charged them with piracy, which could have resulted in up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
But last week, they announced that they're replacing that charge with a lesser charge of prostitution, which carries a lesser sentence with a maximum of seven years in prison.
But Greenpeace warned in a statement today that the piracy charges have not been dropped as promised.
They say that means the detainees are now charged with two felonies.
The powerful Investigative Committee announced last week that they're replacing the piracy charge with the riot charge.
But when the 30 prisoners appeared before the committee this week, the piracy charges were not dropped.
Instead, new charges were brought against each", Greenpeace said in a statement quoted by AFP.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at a Gazprom oil rig in mid-September.
The environmentalists were on the Dutch-flagged ship Arctic Sunrise.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they have appealed, but all of them have been rejected by the court.
Environmentalists have complained about the conditions of detention.
Greenpeace Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said today that the move to St. Petersburg would facilitate the meeting of detainees with their families and consular staff, according to AFP.
However, there is no guarantee that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they may be worse", he warned.
One of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen, has asked the Dutch King Willem-Alexander for help.
In a handwritten letter published today by the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, she urged the monarch to discuss their plight at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Maliki is heavily involved in the resurgence of sectarian violence in Iraq, which he says is partly a result of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar
In English literature classes, you will be required to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onward.
The test will also include a written text to motivate deeper reading;
The combined English Literature and Language courses will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a language baccalaureate and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an elective.
The Department of Education is expected to issue new English and math curricula tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
Other major subjects are due to change next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, the authority which oversees the Senior School Examinations, will reveal changes to the structure of the Senior School Examinations, together with a new grading system and a reduced amount of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus on whether we needed to reform our examination system to regain public trust" and that there was a need to insist that the final examination be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
The study shows that British schools spend less time on mathematics  116 hours a year, or three hours a week  than most other countries.
For comparison, schools in Australia spend an average of 143 hours a year on math, and in Singapore, about 138.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have said that a comprehensive matriculation exam in mathematics  coupled with a greater emphasis on this subject in the results charts  is likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on 'real-world problems', including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: I am not the cancer in the CPSD
Before the election, a long-simmering dispute between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava ČSSD flared up.
The climax of the case was when Ostrava Mayor Petr Kajnar went to court for the undemocratic selection of candidates.
The actors of the case, however, did not want to say too much, so as not to harm the party even more before the elections.
But now the votes are counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava SSD called on the mayor of Ostrava to quit the party on Monday night, and will probably push for him to lose his position.
But Peter Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What the dispute is about and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for the Journal.
How do you feel about the election?
The C.S.S.D. was certainly counting on a much better outcome.
Did it hurt her in our country that the party's internal disputes were resolved in the media before the elections?
I can imagine that the Social Democracy could have a better electoral outcome.
But on the other hand, it's consistent with the state of the CSU right now.
It's a party that has its own internal problems, it's sick inside, and people sense that everything is not right in it.
They made that clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the C.S.D.?
I think the ODS has been in decline for some time now and unfortunately things like this are happening in social democracy.
It's that the lobbyists, the influential people who previously expected to find their prebends in the ODS, have moved to the people in the CSSD and have influence over them.
It has to do with the fact that the police are going around the Ostrava Magistrate's offices and collecting computers.
It shows that the SSC is not just made up of people who want the best for everyone else, but many of them think of their own best interests first.
The CSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps even in Prague, as seen in the current power struggle between the Haskovci and Sobotkovci.
But it's been a long time coming.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a preview of what is happening now in Prague.
Haska's wing has been gradually taking positions to then, after the elections, create a situation that weakens Sobotka's wing.
In politics, you're in a situation where you have to compromise sometimes.
But everyone has an inner boundary that they can't compromise anymore, and that's me.
I didn't want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorák, that I would try to get on the regional candidate, to strengthen Sobotka's wing as mayor of Ostrava.
But the hawk's wing gave it a clue.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not on the side of Michael Hash?
Slávek Sobotko is, in my opinion, a man who always talks primarily about the program of ČSSD and to a certain extent also about visions for the party and for this country.
I confess I heard nothing of the sort on the other side.
Michal Hachek is just fighting for power.
I don't understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can just start to dismiss the party chairman.
This is a power struggle against all odds and against the party's policies.
I think that what Michael Hášek has done in Prague has ended his political career.
How did you feel about the fact that the Ostrava leadership of the ČSSD did not approve of you as a candidate?
Political parties are based on a competition to see who among their members is ranked first.
This competition should be based more on the program's vision and the ability of these people to fulfill that vision.
Of course, people who don't have much skill or vision are also in this race, but the political party is a lift for them to the money they wouldn't get elsewhere.
The problem is that these people start to get in the limelight by brazenly violating the rules, violating the party's statutes.
They are turning political parties into mafias and I think they are violating the laws of the Czech Republic.
It's more important to me to raise awareness of this issue than to consider whether a Kajnar has any political future.
It's important that the parties start respecting the charter.
That's why you filed a motion before the elections to the court for a preliminary injunction against the appearance of the candidate of the CSSD in the Moravian-Silesian region?
The current district executive committee of the CPSU in Ostrava consolidates its power by being able to dissolve organizations that do not suit it, purposefully establish new organizations, gradually expel uncomfortable party members.
For example, they wanted to expel Richard Bednarik from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then decided to revoke the decision to expel him.
This shows that, while enforcing the party's articles of association through the courts is a last resort, it is the only option once the other means and control bodies within ČSSD have ceased to function.
The attempt of the Ostrava ČSSD leadership, led by the MP Adam Rykal, is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It's a public secret that the mayor of Poruba, Lumír Palyza, has a crush on this post.
It's just that Adam Rykala and Lumiere Palyza are trying to do everything they can to get me to recuse myself.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and then they use those votes to consolidate their power in the party.
If I look back, everything that happened, like the football club Minik Ostrava and the purchase of the Bazala stadium, was just a pretext for them to attack me.
It was staged to make me look like a man who puts money where it doesn't belong.
The city has bought a property that is of great strategic value to it.
So how do you see things going with your tenure as mayor?
The district committee has already asked me and a few other people on Monday to consider staying on the board.
I think it's like a thief shouting, "Catch the thieves!"
If we look at the results of my work over the last 11 years, I don't see anyone in the Social Democracy of Ostrava who would initiate and promote, sometimes even against party members, the creation of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of a science and technology park.
I'm still getting uncomfortable with everything.
I don't read it as preventing others from getting to the places they want to be.
Will you fight these efforts in any other way?
Because if this republic is to function well, then the political parties must function well.
I find it hard to believe that any party can effectively run a country when they can't even manage themselves.
So I don't think I'm going to quit the C.S.S.D. now, because I think the one causing the cancer of this party is not me, but these people who are trying to drive me out.
Olomouc opens a public ski area in the historic centre
The organizer of Olomouc's Christmas markets and winter ice skating, Pavel Spálený, said that the preparatory work on the ice rink began on October 26 and the ice production unit has been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice sheet is now seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The ice rink has an area of 375 square meters, the stage took 358 square meters.
Two punch booths will also be available for paddlers and passersby.
"We have expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stands, and almost the entire area of the podium is covered so that skaters can comfortably move around", explained Spalany.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the approaching Christmas.
Last year, the lounge was installed right in front of the main entrance to the Town Hall on the Upper Square for the renovation of the Lower Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed by the end of the summer, so that the ice surface could be returned back to its original location.
The first time people could go skiing right outside the town hall was in 2009 when the ski area was in operation from January to March.
The ice rink has since become an integral part of the city's Christmas markets.
The Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural programme, will open in the Upper Square a month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of a senior citizen in Zlín will be dealt with by the regional court again
The District Court dismissed the charges against the 25-year-old Slovak and the 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men denied the crime.
They're facing 15 to 20 years in prison or a special sentence.
The spokesman, Petr Angyalossy, confirmed that the High Court had annulled the decision of the Regional Court and had returned the case to the Regional Court.
The judge refused to comment on the reasons for this, saying that the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
The indictment alleges that the youths assaulted a 77-year-old man in his home.
Senior died a painful death.
The indictment alleges that the men strangled, beat, and kicked him all over the body and also inflicted about three dozen blows to the head with a metal object, apparently a gas pistol.
The man suffered severe injuries, including a fractured skull, brain swelling, and a brain haemorrhage, which he succumbed to on the spot.
The youths allegedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the district court, the only evidence against the defendants, and moreover only circumstantial, were the scent marks which the expert evaluated as not fully established within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
Although the scent marks from the crime scene and other items matched the defendants in more than ten cases, the police initially treated them as tangible, not scent marks.
In addition, some mishandling was found.
According to the Senate, the defendants' guilt was not beyond doubt.
However, the court found that the police had a very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had fallen and injured himself.
The emergency medical services did not even alert the emergency medical services to the violent death.
The forensic team was contacted by Olomouc doctors who found signs of violent death in the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the crime scene traces that the relatives had cleared up.
No DNA from the defendants was found at the scene.
A young Slovak lived in the Hungarian town of Ugrad.
He is now serving an eight and a half year sentence that was upheld last year by the Olomouc High Court.
He said the man was the head of an organized gang of six young men who committed a robbery of a jewelry store.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopný.
The youngest of the accused in the murder of a senior citizen lives in Uhersk Hradištra.
The court released him in August after 11 months of detention.
The sweat begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium in Znojmo will begin.
On Thursday, construction workers took over the stadium to rebuild the grass.
The reconstruction of the municipal stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards of the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter will close the week with a string of autumn
Saxophone great and jazz legend Wayne Shorter will be making his debut next Wednesday at the 18th annual String Festival of the Fall.
Shorter will perform on November 6th at the Grand Hall of Lucerne along with his quartet composed of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by a spontaneous jazz improvisation by PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kumžák.
Shorter's arrangement for symphony orchestra features the track Pegasus from the novelty album Without A Net, as well as his older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still going strong, as evidenced by the fact that the Prague concert at the Struny Autumna will launch his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the music world over 60 years ago.
The list of artists he has worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he also met the Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and the Viennese native Jo Zawinul, with whom he set the direction of the new fusion style for more than a decade in the legendary Weather Report.
For the last 13 years, he has performed primarily with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
And the after party after the festival will be the Spotlight Club Night, which will take place on November 9th at the Roxy/NoD club.
Beside charismatic singer Andrey Triany, the local audience will be introduced by the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
The ladies are told UEFA forbids the publication of penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairwoman of the refereeing committee of the Czech Football Association, has stopped publishing the referee's penalties.
UEFA rules prohibit her from doing so, she said in an interview with the daily Právo.
Otherwise, he said, the FAČR would be fined.
The Commission also took the view that the aid was necessary to ensure that the beneficiaries would be able to meet the obligations arising from the aid.
This speculation is really pointless.
True, I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the committee are from other places, such as Prague.
So in the case of the vote, I can lose 1: 6", Damková said in response to criticism that erupted after Pilsen recently played twice as many penalties as other league teams.
Although FAČR has stopped issuing penalties for referees in recent months, Damková assures that referees are being punished for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the committee finds that the referee made a mistake, they will limit the delegation, no matter what the match", Damková said.
The reason why the penalties are not published is according to Damka's ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and severely punishes violations".
"We're very suspicious and we look for every mistake".
"We published the restrictions, but I received two very strong warnings that if we don't stop, there will be tough sanctions", Damková said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception", she added.
If the publication of information continues, the Commission could lose money from UEFA for training and development of referees.
"And they are very important to us".
"Without them, we would not be able to complete the referee training programme", added Damková.
The arrest of Barta is connected to Janoušek and Bém: Are they behind the leak of wiretaps?
The chairman of the Public Affairs Committee, Vít Bart, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Together with him, the head of the department of analytics and informatics of the anti-corruption police Jan Petržílek was detained.
Arrested in connection with the wiretapping of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the spies, which came with the Novinky.cz server, was confirmed to the Czech Press Office by a reliable source.
The wiretap recordings of Janusz and Bema's phone calls, published in March last year by the Mladá fronta Dnes newspaper, in which the two men address each other as "Mazánka" and "Kolibříku", show Janusz's influence on the city's movements under Bema's leadership.
The daily then reported that they were taken by the Security Intelligence Service (BIS) in 2007, and leaked to the ABL security agency two years later.
Bart owned it back then.
The server Novinky.cz reported that the detained criminal investigator Petrzylek worked for the BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petrzylek was transferred to the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with the wiretaps, at the same time they were published.
"In view of the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm anything and I cannot say anything", said prosecutor Michal Muravský of the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He refused to confirm that he was even overseeing the case.
The case is not commenting for the same reason the inspection is not.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code .
Six out of ten companies are preparing intensively for the forthcoming entry into force of the new Civil Code and the Law on Business Corporations as of 1 January 2014.
Only 8% of the companies surveyed said that they had not addressed the issues of both key codes at all in their companies.
This is the conclusion of a survey conducted by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed 108 Czech companies.
With the two key codes about to expire, many managers are only now beginning to realise, at the last minute, the profound impact they can have on their companies' business.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the laurels of politicians, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty as to whether or not revolutionary change will eventually come.
"But now they have only a few weeks left to make the transition to the new law for their companies without complications", said Jan Spačil, partner at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
Of the 61% of companies that are actively engaged in the new codes, 26% said that their firms had already taken all necessary measures to be ready in time.
Another 35% of these companies are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
On the other hand, one in five companies has not yet been involved in recodification, yet has a concrete idea of how to prepare for it.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that they have not yet resolved the issues related to recording.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent) for the largest number of surveyed companies, followed by the solution of business conditions (16 percent) and further changes in the real estate cadastre and liability for damages (each ten percent).
The Treaty of Amsterdam, which was adopted in December, was the first to be revised, and the Treaty of Amsterdam, which was adopted in December, was the first to be revised.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Codes will disappear, with the result that contract law should become more transparent for both citizens and businesses.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation offers many novelties with an emphasis on greater freedom of the organization of relationships", warned lawyer Lukáš Poddaný of Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
In the context of the law on commercial corporations, the issue of increasing the responsibility of statutory bodies is considered by almost a quarter of companies as the most important issue.
The next topics are changes in the convocation and conduct of the general meeting (15%) and the representation of the company (14%).
The new legislation means a tightening of obligations and possible implications for statutory bodies, especially in a situation where a company is threatened or fails.
'In practice, this means that if board members and company directors do not act with the care of sound management and do not prevent the impending decline of the company, they may lose the benefits gained from the performance of their duties for the last two years,' added Mr Späcil.
Pierre Rainero: I try to make the style of Cartier evolve as a living language
My job is to preserve tradition and at the same time to steer our brand towards modern things, so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explains Pierre Rainero, Cartier's Director of Style, in an interview with HN.
This French luxury house dates back to 1847.
He travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural areas of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
In West Africa, there are not many doctors; only one for every 5,000 people.
Vote here or on your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates for the 2013 CNN Heroes Award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes Awards, you can vote for him or for any of the other top ten nominees.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the Cameroonian capital Yaoundeo in 1981.
Initially, he was treated for a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would plague him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon", says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received the kind of treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy", says Bwelle.
You can leave your house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be the first one there, but you're not the first one.
There are many patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelle's father died, things haven't changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.
And even if doctors could visit Cameroonians, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the health care spending in this country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty", says Bwelle.
They can't enjoy life because of their poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffering, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a vascular surgeon at the Yaoundé General Hospital.
And he started a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, whose members go to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others crammed into trucks, strapped medical supplies to roofs, and travel through rough terrain to villages in need of help.
They're not always accompanied by luck.
On more than one occasion, the vehicles have to push through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as true heroes: feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodations the community has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle , with her wide smile and unbridled energy , is very willing to join in the local fun.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each expedition", says Bwelle.
They come to the village from within a 60-kilometer radius, and they walk.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide a variety of medical care.
Many are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or donated glasses or a free birth certificate - a document that schools require but that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Surgeries are usually done in a school building, at the town hall, or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to make room for another patient.
With the help of light from a generator, an operating room, and sanitary equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of the morning.
It's exhausting, but the village musicians usually help the team to keep the motivation going.
"To keep us awake and to keep us working, they play the drums all night long", says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team heads back to town, tired but proud of their work.
The group  composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students  performed 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their help can mean a lot to the local population.
One man said that after her hernia surgery, he would be able to work again.
"It'll change the future of our family", the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around Yaounde.
He says that this second job finances about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she actually sleeps", says Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia who volunteers for the Bwelle group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who have come from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice that they wouldn't get at home.
"Dr. Bwellem, we washed his hands thoroughly and removed bloodstains or held his instruments", O'Malley says.
You'll never experience that as a second-year medical student in America.
Student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaoundé, Bwelle provides them with food, transportation and education.
"He is a hero, no doubt", says O'Malley.
This organization is giving its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
Bwelle's constant sweating is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier lives, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job", Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh, easing their pain-- that's why I do it.

Minister Holcát has reinstated the position of Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic
The Head Nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of the nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 000.
"I think it is essential that these functions are clearly defined and formalised, that nurses have a representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if they need to", explained Martin Holcát, Minister for Health.
I respect the work of nurses and I think that the nursing profession deserves to be given due attention by the Ministry.
In the exercise of this profession, not only high professional professionalism is required, but also a human approach and personal conviction.
"I will gladly and responsibly seek to promote those steps which may improve the position of nurses".
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our healthcare system, but I would like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us much with their approach to patients to practice their professions with all their empathy and help us improve the image of nurses in the eyes of the public", says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also stated on the occasion of her inauguration that she wanted to address the most diverse aspects of the nurse position and intended to work with, among others, professional associations, professional societies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I don't want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but rather to see them side by side, each with their own competence, and working together with other healthcare professionals as a cohesive team to provide healthcare for the benefit of the patient".
"I have personally faced a number of problems that arise in the practice of nursing, and I see these difficulties and I intend to contribute to their solution".
These include, for example, ensuring that nursing and medical documentation is simplified.
"I know from personal experience that some administrative tasks are unnecessarily burdensome and take up time that nurses could and should spend with patients", says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas of focus include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve teamwork and collaboration with healthcare provider management, adjusting competences, and labour law issues such as compliance with the labour code or not burdening nurses with a shortage of nurses at a particular time and place.
We often hear anonymous statements that are not documented in a specific case where a violation of the rules might occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and thus the function of the Chief Nurse of the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of preserving the anonymity of such a complaint and letting the specific case be investigated by the competent authorities", concludes Alena Šmídová.
Msgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Health Nurse (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010, she has been head of the Department of Nursing and Other Non-Medical Specialties and Recognition of Qualifications at the Ministry of Education and Science.
During her professional career, she worked as a bedside nurse in the internal department, and also worked as a teacher at the Central Medical School, where she was also a statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009, she worked as a chief nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several professional nursing textbooks and articles in professional journals, and was engaged in lecturing in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
♪ So I don't get hooked on hate ♪
After twelve years, writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, Václav Kahuda (1965) publishes a new novel, Wind, Darkness, Presence.
He predicts that it will not be a thin volume, with a page count comparable to his best-known work, Houština (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu, another prominent Czech writer of the present time - Emil Hakl - testified.
What made you write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it to keep my mouth shut from hating you.
To see around you new and new clones of human folly, small-mindedness, young organisms afflicted by blind selfish striving.
Not to mention us old people, faces ruined by helpless desire, vintage souls and ideologues who try to sell their "product" with the expression of a little slut.
At the turn of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my weird friends, weirdos and hidden creatures.
I'm over that.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning from living on this planet.
I like to go for a walk and then read a book by the lamp at night.
You're talking about a feeling of failure, of hate.
Was there a break in your past that affected you, or are you just going to grow old like the rest of us?
The break occurred a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, I lived after that.
But somewhere inside there's still a surprised, quiet boy.
I see other solitary practitioners, each in their own tornado of anxiety.
Writing books saved me.
I'm participating in this huge, thousands of years of movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an incomprehensible future.
To the vast, breath-taking complexity of life, where each stone is a direct heir to our present.
We are players in a sad and beautiful game where, through trial and error, another generation of beings is created that, in billions of interactions per second, create some superhuman artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or did you start from scratch?
The self-talk, or rather the dialogue, that the right and left hemispheres of the brain have, sometimes flows out and forms a book.
As the peaceful ages are pierced by the quietly sleeping metastases of war, which may one day be awakened - so my book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I felt a silent avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I didn't do something, it would quietly overwhelm me one day.
It's a set of questions that the brain has formulated and superimposed on layers that are stored in the darkness "below the level of consciousness".
The neocortex, the grey cortex, is going through older evolutionary structures, going to the ancient cranial tree.
He talks to furry beasts, questions snakes, looks for answers in the flight of birds, looks up to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law within me and the starry sky above me.
After all, the brain is asking the world.
You talk about the ego relatively often in metaphorical terms - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that a person has had.
This logical and emotional forest of exposed and branching trees of information, of memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, its cognitive process, is exposed to the ever-changing present, in its unrelenting effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there's a malfunction from overload.
Analogously, if you "dropped" a PC, from a speech emulator program and a foreign language translator, you would first wander around in an operating environment, such as Windows, and after several failed reboots, you would end up in the dark green glowing screen of BIOS, in the underlying system that controls the functions and collaboration on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those of you who haven't figured out what I'm talking about, I'm talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why is this particular type of regression of interest to you on a regular basis?
Because it's a pit.
The ultimate mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behaviour are breaking down.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "He looked into the abyss for so long that the abyss looked into him".
A feeling of loss arises when all hope is lost, when a person mentally "dies" and a new quality takes its place.
And why is that of any personal interest to me?
I'll answer with a parable.
Once a man fell into a boat and drowned, and then days and months and years went by, and he was drowning and reading, and those books taught him how to swim, how to live.
He became a "diver".
I hope some of my sentences will help someone, as the lyrics of Hrabal once helped me.
How much do you think about the reader, the specific person who's going to read your text?
The one about which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, others super ego, but I think it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of word and sentence formulation".
From early youth he read old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo's submarine, ran through the Shínadl in dark alleys.
Anyway, after all the talk about authors and their message, it's "The bright sun of other worlds by Karl Hynck Macha".
And if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
The feedback that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course I care about the opinions of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, maybe years later, I'm contacted by random people on the street, and they thank me for helping them with a difficult life decision with my book.
Books are actually "lives" or, more accurately, "sacreds".
They are encoded in the letters of the alphabet, they carry the experience, the history of the regions of each language.
We can bring them to life at any time by letting their sentences flow into their brains.
It's actually, in a way, something forbidden divine -- to awaken more and more life stories, smaller universes and temporary planets.
It's a fact whose DNA is lined up in the ancient demonology books to commit witchcraft.
After the book is published, you have, as is the custom, a chain of author readings.
I remember you used to like to read.
You're gonna jump back in with joy, or is it gonna feel different after all these years?
I'm just telling the story now.
And what did I find out?
There are good, intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic characteristic - they're inconspicuous, they don't draw too much attention to themselves, they have a friendly vibe, you don't feel lonely with them.
Let me give you an example: in the town of Červený Kotelec lived (and I hope he still lives) a curly bookkeeper (his name is aptly Červenka), a cheerful fellow and a good girl bull.
At one of the drinks, he introduced me to the individual chapters of the chain of readers of my book The Cluster.
I looked into their eyes, and then I was shown a shredded, read copy of my book.
Embarrassed, I put down my unopened journal and sobbed manly for a moment.
We all stood there in silence, making out and sobbing drunk with the car.
Then the young blond half-breed couldn't take it anymore and he jumped out of the window with his head screaming into the snow.
It was downstairs.
We ran into the night-lands and the flocks with the happy rage of the sensitive, the aching soul of the country and the shadow of the reclusive patriots, howling and howling like wolves until dawn.
Each of your books is different in form and content from the previous ones.
Does that apply to the text of Wind, Darkness, Presence?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale about a land beyond nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts into the mouth of the folk healer the words of an old Russian legend: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a little dog, with a grey chest.
The horror, the horror, the mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we were once devils in hell, casting lots to see what part we'd play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to let the free flow of inspiration take over again?
The answers are eternal.
Writing is a wonderful form of dialogue.
Something vast and unnamed, like the movement of the continents on the planet, influences our desires from such depth and in such breadth that it completely transcends our horizon - and so we act with complete self-evidence in exactly the intentions of our programmed assignment.
We're rewarded with a flood of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, die defending and gaining new personal territories.
Sometimes there's a malfunction, and we're all just so compassionate.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That's the answer to your question - a biological robot already full of malfunctions, standing on the shore of an ocean of unconsciousness, and in a hollow sail made of a dirty handkerchief catching the tidal breeze.
I have to write to be a human being.
Obama is backing away from health care.
After a flurry of criticism, President Obama yesterday backed off from his oft-repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health care program, you can keep it".
Citing hundreds of thousands of reports of resignations from providers, Republicans in recent days have accused the president of misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama backtracked on his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have a functioning health insurance can keep it", he said in his speech in Boston.
In what he called the "media fuss" over the resignations, Obama urged Americans who had received these notices to look for new insurance policies.
Most people will be able to get a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer", he said.
His administration says it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchased insurance on their own may be forced to change their plans because their insurance doesn't meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
"I say this to these Americans straight up: you deserve better", Sebelius said in her testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has been "a breeze" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else", she said.
I'll try to win back your trust.
The irritated Sebelius uttered this line, picked up by a microphone, to a counselor sitting behind her at a committee meeting yesterday, which followed a tumultuous exchange with Republican Billy Long, the Missouri representative, over whether she should join the Obama care program herself.
For more than three hours during Sebelius's hearing, he repeatedly asked why the architect of the Affordable Care Act didn't voluntarily give up on government-sponsored insurance and buy the program through HealthCare.gov that it now forces on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire are you gonna be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, the owner of PPF Group, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both companies have confirmed the deal, and according to various sources in the agencies and behind the scenes, it's already in the works.
The notification of the transaction should come as late as November, probably before the start of the LTE frequency auction, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek is the owner of the KKCG group.
Under the brand name Sazka Telecommunications, it entered the frequency auction for LTE networks.
And to everyone's surprise, until then, the company's desire to penetrate into telecommunications was not talked about.
But now Saza is being led by a very experienced telecommunications expert, Robert Chvátal.
He started as the head of marketing of Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), later became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile and lastly headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays a few cards at a time.
She signed up for the auction, and now she's admitting she wants to start a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If he succeeds in the auction, he will be able to move existing customers from his own virtual operator into his network.
This would probably not be to Vodafone's liking under normal circumstances, but according to the Economic Times, this could be part of a much closer collaboration between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement by competing operators O2 and T-Mobile to share their networks completely.
Vodafone needs a partner like that.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in bidding for LTE networks (as a newcomer it can bid for specially allocated spectrum), Vodafone may not have to bid at all, or it may not mind bidding for only limited spectrum (there is not enough spectrum for everyone).
Vodafone can share the network with Saz.
Vodafone will introduce Saška into its 2G/3G network (respectively the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz) allowing the company to rapidly start up the network.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building a high-cost LTE network that Vodafone will be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Vodafone could then spend the money saved on a fixed-line Internet provider or a cable provider.
What about Kellner?
The purchase of the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak subsidiary is a Czech one) would immediately have created a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, he's a big-ass piece of shit waiting to be restructured.
At the auction, Kellner would have acquired the LTE network for O2 and very likely in partnership with T-Mobile.
The two companies have already declared that they will share the networks.
The auction could finally be a success, but it's unlikely to be the high-end one that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic would be able to choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will Czech TV ever be able to do without signing events?
The era of President Zemana has seen the legendary scene with the ashtray, and it is not difficult to hear the complaints that gather evidence of the mining of the castle.
In the past, the influence of Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdyk was not documented, let alone signed.
Right, the editors stopped the management.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where such a fondness of some journalists for the citizens comes from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order or, to avoid vulgarism, a typical manifestation of inappropriate empathetic hospitality.
And, given the general decadence, one cannot help wondering whether the television landscape is being altered by other, no less unscrupulous, power interests that have not yet had a chance to do so.
Those who say that in developed countries there are no attempts to intervene politically in broadcasting are right.
But it's also true that this doesn't mean that there are no complaints about the public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
Instead, they criticize what they see as their own bias, the product of their subculture.
Maybe we're just not at this stage of civilization, and we're not in that situation.
But perhaps in a country that thinks itself the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of a messy situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings collides with each other.
The curse of this country: presidents on the verge of power
It is almost a rule that at crucial moments in the country, the head of state is not in the form to be able to fulfill his state duties.
If Masaryk had been five years younger physically and mentally, he would have lived to see the end of his presidency and the events around Munich would have played out a little differently.
We probably wouldn't win the war, but after a symbolic stand-off, the air force could be flown over the border, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London immediately, without having to fight for its legitimacy.
And, most importantly, that surrender would have kept the nation from hanging on to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman and was still fit under Mnichov, but during the war he was already going downhill and in February '48 he behaved accordingly.
If he had been better off, he could have gone into exile for the third time and undermined the legitimacy of the communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hach.
They elected him on the grounds that "Mr. President won't get into a situation where he has to make a decision".
He had to, though the big decision making thing with the knife to Hitler's throat in the chancellery probably wasn't.
The chief of intelligence, František Moravec, until the last days of March 1939, said that everything should be done to make sure that the occupation, which he knew exactly on the day, did not go so smoothly and with such profit for the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, both distrusted and feared.
The human wreck Gottwald had his fellow prisoners executed as Moscow ordered.
Ludwig Svoboda was unable to participate in the normalization and had to be removed from office.
That Husák was a helpless and sickly depressed old man made it easier in November '89, but that's the only good part.
Havel was lucky that the last few years hadn't seen him in office, he was spared the worst.
While Klaus is still a fresh tennis retiree, his many exploits suggest that his thought processes are not what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
The head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks the way he looks, and we don't know all the details yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the Republic.
Or maybe it's there, just not so visible.
Then the question is, is it exceptionally not good (historically) that the president is not fully in power.
But it's not a normal state.
Can we not elect someone reasonably sane and reasonably sane to be president of this country once again?
Far away planets, black-and-white movies, or a little fantasy about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would lightly discuss.
In the concept of his quartet, which will close this year's Strings of Autumn Festival in the great hall of Lucerne in Prague on November 6, everything is connected to everything.
The score of Wayne Shorter's jazz sax quartet is the momentary feelings of the musicians.
His assignment is to have two generations of younger colleagues play what they're experiencing.
They approach music as a purely improvised chamber affair and think not of harmony or rhythm but of the images of the film.
But this principle is not one that the recently 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, nine-time Grammy winner, former Miles Davis sideman, and today perhaps the greatest living jazz saxophonist - is happy to explain.
He doesn't talk much about music, although his whole outlook on life is very much related to music.
In my 80's, I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do is to be surprised by life.
"Too many people plan everything and then are disappointed when things turn out differently", says Shorter.
How Thai Insects Boosted Bar Sales in Paris
You may be fond of insects, but you may not realize that you eat about a pound of them each year on a voluntary basis.
Like ground into flour.
If you're consuming it consciously, you're definitely trending: it's organic, it's nutritious, and you're also providing a unique experience.
The first insect dish to appear on his Paris menu in early October was prepared by Elie Daviron, chef and owner of Le Festin Nu.
The bar, whose name was inspired by William Burroughs' book Naked Lunch, is located in the fashionable 18th arrondissement, near the tourist-heavy Montmartre.
With fresh avocados, roasted red peppers, ginger, and quail eggs, guests can now enjoy the bite of not only various larvae, grasshoppers, and water beetles but also scorpions.
Carefully packaged consignments (to prevent insects from damaging the wings, legs, or eyes) are sent to the Daviron family from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, and elsewhere it's common.
The owner of a Paris bar that has pioneered the menu gives several reasons for eating insects.
The first is the environmental benefits, because insect production is much less costly to the planet -- in terms of money, space, and water consumption -- than traditional meat.
"Insects are also an excellent source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids", Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not neglect his profession, but simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
He says that what makes a restaurant right is pleasure, a sense of guilt, and the atmosphere of the place.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just mediating a new experience", he said.
Not everyone would be thrilled to see a beetle eating a pest, but the reaction of the customers of a Paris bar to the insect is very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics, they say, will eventually taste it, even if they start with the smallest of morsels and choose the scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Union of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: The new green savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and the lack of interest of the state in addressing the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings Programme was a positive signal for our building sector, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in the regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who will save a lot of money on heating after the measures are implemented, but also for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Every billion invested will bring the state more than 2,700 new jobs.
From the point of view of the State's fiscal policy, there are significant leverage and multiplier effects, and it is also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
The Union of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the Government's decision and asks for the implementation of such steps as would allow the continuation of the programme so that further challenges can be issued within it.
The following table is inserted in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council:
The dog shrunk the carpet, the president stumbled and ended up with the saddles.
President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in Lani.
What's his medical condition?
In an unprecedented admission, John Kerry said that American intelligence had gone too far.
John Kerry has signaled a softening of the U.S. defense posture on its surveillance programs, and in an unprecedented admission, said that in some cases, the espionage has gone too far.
The secretary of state also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting like "autopilots" in the wake of the NSA's spy revelations, which were revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The leaked information has sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, via video link, at an open government conference in London, said, "There's no doubt that the president and I and others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that have been happening out of inertia, because there was that possibility, with reference to World War II, the difficult period of the Cold War and then of course 9/11.
He became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage crossed the line, but insisted that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far".
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people and is already conducting a thorough investigation so that no one feels that there has been any abuse.
I assure you, this process does not involve the abuse of the rights of innocent people.
But Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA was a good organization and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We are facing a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up".
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill and blow people up and attack governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we've prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, people from being executed, because we can already know about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday that U.S. lawmakers are heading to Europe to address foreign concerns about alleged U.S. spying and to convince Europeans that they must continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he's spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he's concerned about their threats to stop joining anti-terrorist organizations because they're disillusioned with the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It is really important to the national security interests of the United States that Europe stays on board with us in the fight against terrorism", said Murphy, a Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I'm heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism regardless of their anger at the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA had collected millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some American allies, though the agency's head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected misunderstandings about the metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States,
Another revelation cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had tapped the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and as many as 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended Allied espionage as necessary and said it was common practice on both sides.
In the midst of the turmoil, Murphy said his office is planning a parliamentary trip to take place this year, and he hopes to have members of both parties and the House in the delegation.
The names of other lawmakers who intend to get involved are expected to be released in the coming days.
He said the program was still being worked on.
Although Murphy said the trip was to help mend relations, he added that "well-intentioned educational measures" would also be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people about the spy programs they've been using for years.
"While we are adjusting our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also realise the fact that we are not the only ones spying here", said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to respond to the hostility caused by the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
Australian woman appeals against stay in Thai prison
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island after falsely claiming she was attacked by a taxi driver has appealed the verdict and has been released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged on June 15 by a provincial court in Phuket for wrongful conviction after she told Thai police that a taxi driver and two other men who allegedly detained her had attacked her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, a commercial television footage later revealed that after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket Police interviewed Bamford for two days before she admitted she made up the story.
She was held in a local police cell before her trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of being placed in an adult women's prison.
She's the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunkes, who has asked the Foreign Office in Canberra to help with his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely worried" about their daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"Obviously it's a difficult time, but we hope that he comes back to us safely as soon as possible", said Tunks.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on 50,000 baht bail.
Reports from Australia say that she had been vacationing in the Krabi resort in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that an appeal could lead to a trial, which would increase her sentence and result in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be trying to repair the image of tourists that may have been behind the acquittal verdict.
Jagr joked, "A goal from the breakaway?"
He got a puck in the defensive zone and nobody caught him.
Plus, the escape turned into a fast-forward cliche.
Jaromir Jagr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, then on Thursday night, the 119th NHL winning goal commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Petr Svobod got a call from the director of České dráhy and asked him if I would be interested in advertising their newest train Pendolino!" wrote Jagr with enthusiasm.
He said we're a lot alike in our looks.
I guess I'm gonna have to stop doing my night workouts so I don't get any faster.
"I'm afraid that the Minister of Defense will call and want to advertise the jets!" he added with a smile.
And New Jersey has claimed its second straight victory.
"And above all, you have noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottrova is working", concluded Jaeger.
Instead of the post-dinner candles, the post-dinner stew.
The October elections brought a pile of losers rather than winners.
It is not only the parties that did not even get into the Chamber of Deputies (for example, SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD because of its internal division.
The politicians replaced the Christmas candles with post-death goulash for the weekend.
The springboard of the elections was the movement of Andrej Babiš, which promised voters to change the previous political style of government.
The fragmentation of the election result and the division in the winning party is recorded by the political (for) the sake of Mr. President Miloš Zeman regardless of the wishes of the voters, who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the Chamber of Deputies.
While the president has lost his strategic advantage over other politicians due to the unfortunate event, there are still a few ways for him to regain it - such as choosing a future prime minister.
While the CPSD's chances of winning the Prime Minister's seat are declining in my eyes, the entrepreneur Andrei Babis's chances are increasing.
Although the popular development is still miles away from the quick and smooth formation of a stable government, compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing government of the ČSSD supported by the Communists, this development is still better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy.
Given the vocal opposition of ANO to join forces with ODS or TOP 09, the most likely variant is still a coalition of ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (total 111 MPs).
In view of the split in the ČSSD, which has thus become an unreadable and weak negotiating ground, the outcome of the coalition negotiations can be quite disheartening for the ČSSD.
The minority government of the ČSSD, composed of "aliens" in the Castle, is unlikely to pass.
Moreover, any government in which the ČSSD participates will be threatened by the unfulfilled ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to another split in the party.
So I ask myself, "Are we rushing into another snap election?"
The next election would be a referendum on the strength of the electoral mandate of the ANO.
The plans of the CSE to introduce sectoral taxes, increase taxes on income or build a state bank have fallen hopefully under the table.
The parties ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsvit agree, on the contrary, for example, on the promotion of entrepreneurship, a moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), support for the employment of disadvantaged people, a lower VAT rate for selected goods.
The most common areas of friction are social policy and the size of the state.
ANO is now in the lead, so the program of the most likely coalition ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would lean more to the right.
Which, in my opinion, is a better result than the leftist tax on everything that moves in the economy.
