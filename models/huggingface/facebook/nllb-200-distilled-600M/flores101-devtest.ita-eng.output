USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic community to work to create a safe environment for all its athletes.
We agree with what the USOC says, that the interests of our athletes and our clubs and their sport can be better served by bringing about significant change within our organisation, not by decertification.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but it provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal were brownish brown at the top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's feathers do not have the basic structure, the so-called rachid, but instead have other characteristics typical of feathers, beards, and beards, the researchers concluded that the rachid is likely the result of evolutionary development following those characteristics.
The structure of the feather suggests that it was not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or courting, and the researchers suggest that, although the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult feather rather than a chicken feather.
According to the researchers, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals a feather for an adult, not a chicken.

The luminosity is used along with the rotation to define a star's Rossby number, which is bound to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less the star's activity relative to magnetic inversions.

The activity was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was probably caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a force of attraction on Earth that generates tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same as those of "normal" matter.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of solitary, made up of a multitude of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has identified extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
According to a statement in an interview, this new variant was "highly worrying and alarming, given the high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll said that some patients may have contracted the microbes inside the hospital, and at least two of them were health workers at the hospital itself.

In France, voting is traditionally a lowtech experience: voters enter an isolated cabin and put a pre-printed sheet in an envelope indicating the chosen candidate.
After verification of his identity by officials, the voter deposits the envelope in the urn and signs the electoral register.

Four female team skaters failed to finish their descent, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to recover the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for raping the Swiss woman, and we have also recovered her cell phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court face-covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh's Sheriff's Court charged with the murder of her own son.
She is being held pending trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be contaminated, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice has other parameters, and Scottish courts have found the publication of the photographs potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who post photos or other suspicious subjects are walking on minefields".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for the court proceedings, has told reporters that no further comments will be released until at least the formal indictment.
According to what has been leaked, the document will be the subject of the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other issues reportedly being discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon that presence for only five years.
The shooters within the pest control experimental programme had to be closely monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme, the NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of NPWS's Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety training and instruction.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as a member of a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth Interim Electoral Council in Martelly's four years.
Last month a presidential committee proposed a package of measures to push the country towards new elections, including the resignations of the previous CEP.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, against the regime.
Occasionally violent protests have been sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
Some 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
In its reply, the Ministry described Apple's postponement of the report as 'absolutely deplorable'.
The quake in the Marianas was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage was reported in the nation.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami going on.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle on the tourists.
Many of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were immediately released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career as a physician.
After training in obstetrics, she joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, Liggins began studying cases of preterm labor in her spare time.
His research showed that administering a hormone would speed up the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' of flight records on Wednesday.
Even his wrestling mates wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Moon was the first Queen of the Far East, my first manager, she died on the night of the two moons, unique, just like her, a strong woman".
"The moon was as strange as I was... perhaps even more... I love her and will miss her... hopefully in a better place", was the comment of Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
According to a survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the interim prime minister, Julia Gillard, stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of the survey participants, who believe Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
Among those opposed to the survey, 29% of those interviewed say Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but she has accused several disorders that have led to doubts about her fitness.
He couldn't take the pain medication because they're banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
The discovery was verified by several people using various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources of water and organic matter, which can form proteins and support life, on earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form and, in particular, how the Earth formed after colliding with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a bill that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He says speculation is nothing more than "political nonsense and nonsense".
A presidential bid is expected in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel a year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of obsolete ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being arranged and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there are no car parks or interchange parking facilities available on site.
Fears of a lack of transportation have led to the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird would be born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time needed for this process was much longer; this was due to the mating between a Darwin endemic fringe, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus fringe, Geospiza conirostris.
They can be worked into any shape, they can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin thread, suitable for twisting and intertwining.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals, and it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called miniature codes, thanks to the ability to be made so thin.
It's called the pH of the substance, and using red cabbage juice, you can build a pH indicator.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level of the chemical being analysed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been ripped off by electrons (as hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, stick them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost every home in the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a running water bath with an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, the remains of sewage networks were discovered in the dwellings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
Bathrooms in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization they were sometimes placed in public bathrooms, frequented by a mixed public of men and women.
To make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and visual perception.
To carry a satellite or telescope into space, a rocket over 100 feet high is needed.
The wheel has changed the world enormously, and among the many advantages it has offered, the most important is that it has provided us with easier and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, they made their appearance in the train, the automobile, and various other means of transportation.
Beneath them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on small prey, much larger ones, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every feline has that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in numerous groups called branches.
The branches are composed of adult males, usually two or three related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
The females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pack of lions acts very similarly to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other large felines), even with regard to deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (though not too well), swim, jump very long and exert a tensile force five times that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it is more like a phrase of screaming and angry words.
They like to feed on small animals, hunting monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the prey they catch is much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by sniffing at the ground where they have been.
Thanks to their night vision, they are able to see very clearly in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily, and to hunt their prey, they mimic their surroundings and then jump on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island, making it difficult to return), it will likely find itself in a different environment from where it was before.
This new environment is characterised by different resources and competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciesing.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide they expel (through exhalation).
Plants process their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis.
We build our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is made from plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaurus was the super predator of his era and for that reason he feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
From its long jaws came more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, plus an additional row on the palate, so anyone crossing its path was out of the way.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a forked tongue, and his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it's also possible that he was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex couldn't compete with him.
Although most of their food would seem familiar, Roman banquets also included various strange or unusual feasts, such as the wild boar, peacock, snail, and a rodent species called the giraffe.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men enjoyed feasting together lying on one side while consuming their meals.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include various foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurat, were built, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Because of the mild climate in the Middle East, the house was not of paramount importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard, while shops were simple outdoor benches facing the street.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and Norse sagas say that it was Erik the Red who named it, having met Greenland on his journey after he was exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of what he discovered, Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although all were "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is a treasure map drawn.
Even if something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776".
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Probably, then, the annotation was intended only as a label.
The D-Day landings and ensuing clashes had led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, or those French who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action took the name "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France in just two weeks and were heading for Germany.
Civilization is a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civiis, which means civilized; the term is in turn connected with civis, or citizen, and civitas, or city or city-state, and in a certain way defines the dimensions of society.
Cities-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of a nation.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, thus not being recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, and Congress was the only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of national executive or judicial power, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, for the enforcement of its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
The amendments required the unanimous consent of all the States, which had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national football team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
They are part of Japan's nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
Geographically, Japan is referred to as an "archipel", given the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who passed through the island gradually recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Wonderful Island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation involving Aboriginal grain production systems and hiring Chinese craftsmen to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces; in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895 thus ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three primary structures, and notably the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Much of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the site of Machu Picchu had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35mm, the same as the most commonly used film at the end of the analogue photography era.
It is still produced today, and more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many common formats (e.g. the APS family) are equal to or very close to this value.
The often-used and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where the main subject is placed is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, either vertically or horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
Christianity had been the glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and customary differences.
His omnipresent power has affected everyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary reserves exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of all essential military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, even putting neutral ships at risk.
Since this tactic had provoked a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and horrors of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City, which led him to move to the United States.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in the previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, the different periods of time were indicated in very singular ways: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The periods between individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars were fought between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting for a place of honor in the imposing Xi'an Palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since the rankings of the army, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers itself a very clear picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave rests on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
It's not really easy to find, even if you knew it existed.
Nothing is seen except a beautiful clear sky and a large number of mountains around it. From the inside of the cave, you can see or hear very little of the world around you.
Of the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived to the present day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plain, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, various temples, and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and family.
The 'upwardly curved' indication resembles a V and the 'downward curved' indication a graph or a square without the lower side.
Upwards means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downwards means you should start from the alarm (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
An upward bow usually produces a softer sound, while a downward bow produces a stronger and more decisive sound.
You can choose to add your own custom pencil notes, but keep in mind that the archival signs you find printed have a musical value, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women in the market forced King Louis XVI, in terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, together with Queen Maria Antonietta, their two young children (Mary Teresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
They returned to Paris in a chariot, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the rulers.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their chariot open.
At some point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The US imperialist war expenses incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people in the time was the basis of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The period of time in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which culminated by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretation of technological determinism has in common two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to an increased percentage of road accidents, and as a result, the invention of new rescue techniques for treating injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, treated by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Within the framework of Romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time customs, customs and culture have emerged linked to that geography which, being in harmony with the context of society, have proved more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Like Paris, now known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a neural center of luxury began around 400 C.E. and continued until about 1100 C.E.
During the 12th century its prestige declined, mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The height of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
But the slow pace of communication means that the spread of Western styles may be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style.One of the most significant developments of the period, resulting from the Crusades, was the introduction of button bindings.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence farming when it is carried out solely for the purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually of a biological nature, which uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at maximizing the harvest.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this still is the case.
Subcultures share common opinions with individuals who do not feel representative of society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Often members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or the effect of intentional abuse, grew up without proper socialization with adults.
Some of these children have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases abandonment is motivated by the rejection of serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Other children may have been raised by animals; others appear to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is fully raised by nonhuman animals, he exhibits behaviours (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that took care of him, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself simpler and more interesting, while the scaffold goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning mode, but rather a help for those who are beginning a new learning experience, as can the use of a new computer program or the launch of a new project.
In other words, a teacher is an example of a scaffolding, but so is the little graffiti-shaped assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to question, solicit and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on his own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not provide nutrition, care and training, but it does.
We believe the foster home is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The trust is supposed to cover all unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and reward theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's study (1998) on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal engagement" and "continuous relationships".
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people who cannot understand spoken language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even argues that such abilities in interpreting human behaviour can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the back and forth variability between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savannah.
In addition, failure to implement these activities has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest unless they're cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way that savannas do today.
Sleep interruption is the intentional awakening process that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a restart of sleep (1060 minutes later).
This process can be easily implemented by using a relatively quiet wake-up call to bring you to a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
If you decide to reset your sleeping watch, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythmic options involve the consumption of many liquids before bedtime (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys inner peace in proportion to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The less tension there is, the more positive the existing life force is, and each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment, and that goal is only hindered by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the love path of the Mahayana rite and various techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) through the use of yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. By depicting various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and it would be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were soon obsolete, however, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Nonaggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the Marines has always been to ensure that the country safeguards its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the same ability of the enemy to move their people and goods.
One recent example of this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies hadn't succeeded, Germany would probably have had a chance to conquer Britain, just as it had in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They began to be raised by cultures and tribes of antiquity to have milk, hair, meat, and skin readily available.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds left free to move on hills or other pasture areas, often tended by goats (like shepherds) who were often children or adolescents.
As early as the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although they were simply made of parallel wooden axles, wagonways, compared with the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed horses traveling along them to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossings were introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in position, but gradually, it became clear that tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused a greater wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels replaced iron wheels, and in 1767 the first railways made entirely of iron appeared.
The first means of transportation known to man was the legs, which began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal walking are found in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent, we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and even activism.
In many cases, this only works as a symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problem and turn it off.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot because of humanity's scientific and technological advances, while the problems have increased because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced overnight, now known as "The Dunlap Posters".
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the yard of Independence Hall and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap embroidery still known are the oldest extant copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that a category of dinosaurs survived and are still alive.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many features in common with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their back legs.
In short, the manipulation of encoded information in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently in use.
A binary number can have only one of two values, or 0 or 1, and in computer technical language these numbers are called binary numbers or bits.
The symptoms, including vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of indoor poisoning could be the presence of an open container of medicines or harmful chemicals in the home.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term mites is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have adapted strongly to become parasites of man.
Both killer bed bugs and bed bugs are nesting bed bugs, that is, adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, ranking first among neurological diseases affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are twice as high as males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their own interest, or that of their child.
These couples have the option of choosing an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which in fact guides most scientific inquiry.
But it's not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also helps guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the gradual decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, in relation to most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was the one conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They ran two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the affected cells belong to the germ line.
Mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Naturalistic tourism invites people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and flora.
Examples of activities to be carried out on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about the oranges of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small rural villages to drive to work, crossing over with other people whose workplace is where they just left.
In this dynamic Andri-Vienese, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which they support at the same time.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stable conditions that has allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone is involved in social life and uses transport systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling apart are rare.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they being thrown out every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show a reasonable consistency and can be represented generically mathematically.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables: (1) volume, (2) density and (3) speed were correlated.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly has made them easier to escape from enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small crabs to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemeral ones.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
For some, he was right, but many others believed otherwise, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and even the other stars), was moving around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying eight times the amount of water as the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
20% of the total water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, draining thousands of smaller tributaries.
They continued to build stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of greatness and technical excellence in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained fascinated by the monuments of their ancestors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man has been learning about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times. These elements can be found in nature in native form and can be extracted quite simply with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These in fact resemble the four states of matter, that is (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma.
Alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so that trillions of them could fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil thus proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less widespread use.
Today, everyone writes messages on computer screens and never has to go near a temperature monitor.
We can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something new arrives.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the fission bomb's operation.
It's basically like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and then, by further dividing the core, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down in the presence of little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
The marys may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner, which has facilitated the lava's rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow up.
These theories analyze what some people have in common and what motivates them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that motivate them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most common content theories are Maslow's Theory of the Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, when managers start to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge: on the one hand, there are those who try to stay "one of the guys" (or girls).
Such a manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
In the opposite extreme, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels he has to change the whole team operation and do it himself.
Ultimately, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some minor differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of a point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings may take place depending on the various time zones, which may not be covered by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member refers and which sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organisation be willing to tackle the long process leading to the building of a learning organisation?
When all the resources available in all functional departments of an organization are used effectively, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
The collaborative path within an organisation to overcome an obstacle can therefore lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order for an organisation to be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological results have shown the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and the area of research is becoming narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and cancer can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been observed before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite its strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with intelligent machine behavior, learning and adaptation.
AI research includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as writing, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real problems.
AI is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Tours are a fundamental part of teaching, and teachers often want to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution is offered by virtual tours, where students can see artifacts from museums, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills, and often their first experiences with blogs are marked by poor grammar and spelling, but usually the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the author of the blog is committed to improving writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them". The need to feed the interest of the public motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop students' learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By responding actively to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's evocative and bilingual capital, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the country's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and further north you can admire the natural and pristine beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All of this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian in foreign opinion.
The broadest areas to the north are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wilderness.
If you compare the population, the result may be surprising to many: the number of African-American citizens in the United States is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxury seaside resorts, are mostly independent or associated nations with France.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, which took a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For women traveling: all are advised to declare that they are married, regardless of their actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they themselves consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, held in the arm, etc.
Have the determination to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it as the White House, which they abandoned in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by Spanish merchants who chose these places for their trading bases.
Across Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least attractive cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, narghilÃ¨ and a lot of peddling, but all this is reserved for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to document well before making any visits outside Goma, so as to assess well the state of the ongoing clashes in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (mobile taxi) to get around Goma.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a decadent city, but its reputation remains a tourist attraction, with an airport.
In 1990 it was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Danger because of the threat posed by desert sands.
One of the main milestones was the PBS Henry Louis Gates special "Wonders of the African World".
With its more Arab than African touch, the city stands out clearly from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeast South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, north borders Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecoregions, each of which provides food for a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily contributions are provided for conservation and entry into the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a sparkling bar chart, even more evident because framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon across the street.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development has focused on heavily populated land reclamation on the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists chose for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of this land's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the widest mangrove coastal strip in the world, stretching for 50 miles from the coast to the inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
However, forests are not only mangrove swamps; they also contain what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary; the area is estimated to be home to 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses frequently run between districts, it is good to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are reached by comfortable, rugged Japanese minibuses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a sparkling bridge connecting the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two trusses are 83 meters high, 378 meters long and have two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The free vertical space under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
By September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The GuaranÃ­ were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycuru and PayaguÃ¡, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and indigenous peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place at the Las CaÃ±itas polo fields.
You can watch minor tournaments and games at other times of the year.
For information on the tournaments and the purchase of polo tickets, contact the AsociaciÃ³n Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Islands have their own official currency, the Falkland pound sterling (FKP), which is equivalent to the British pound sterling (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store, offers currency exchange.
British pounds are generally accepted on the islands, and Stanley can often be paid with credit cards and U.S. dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outlying islands, although British and US currencies may be accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30Â°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely get below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a lower temperature than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rain" seasons: rainfall is almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to human sight, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/metre from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/metre from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, elk, deer, bears, virtually any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping an adequate distance, and they must be given adequate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also, bear in mind that the smell can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking foods that smell very strong, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan Islands, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of the infamous naval stalemate of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk except one British cruiser, nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the city led to the assassination of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The Pacific Ocean-facing beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mostly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitemata.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide selection of shops.
The most popular local beer is a simple, pleasant, refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have a lot of French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines could handle the trip better.
The tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you're afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, flat white coffee is a foreign idea: the espresso is black short coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on the same level as the Belgian one. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Many excursions to the reef are made throughout the year and accidents from one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Always seek advice from authorities, follow directions and pay close attention to security warnings.
The cubedum occurs from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks fear them and tend to stay away.
The saltwater crocodiles' habitat consists mainly of river estuaries north of Rockhampton, where they do not live actively in the ocean.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the serenity to find a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often make arrangements with certain hotels, but other accommodation forms, such as campsites, can still be booked through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transfer to/from the airport or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also keep the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this to be a crucial element of the experience.
To be near the center of the action, you need to arrive early and get a space near the music.
Remember that once the music on the main stages is over, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the ice crossing causes rather annoying noises for those most exposed.
Cruise ships in St. Petersburg include time to explore the city.
Generally, casinos do everything they can to increase the time and money spent by their guests, usually without windows or clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests' mood high and keep them in a good mood.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered by the house, but drunkenness alters judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of remaining sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice or near-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy tracks, friction is reduced and driving is not possible as on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, in a very short time, so much snow can fall that you get stuck.
Rain and snow, or ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the focus of many visitors' holiday.
In its popular usage, the term safari refers to journeys made by land, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so a normal set of equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes fearful, and that is why they can be better observed with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "excursion safari", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, with some events taking place in other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, the first of which took place in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary among them, however most cancellation policies related to the coronavirus, as of late March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most event tickets will be between Â¥2,500 and Â¥130,000, while normal tickets will cost about Â¥7,000.
Many hotels offer the use of iron and a striped axle, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have a stretcher iron, or if you do not like to wear stretched socks, you can try a hair dryer, if you have one.
Care should be taken not to subject the tissues to too high temperatures to avoid constriction or, in the worst case, burns.
There are several ways to clean water, and some of them are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is appropriate to consider the purchase of bottled water from a reliable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not widespread in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy duty-free and excise goods in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions, as it often passes through isolated areas between the vegetation.
If you are not accustomed to driving on country roads, you should keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow roads and narrow curves prevail.
The speed limits shown are significantly lower than those applied in previous and subsequent tracks (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h).
Strangely, however, the level of coverage of mobile phone service in this area is much higher than in other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit candy is a classic, and it's not uncommon to find apples all year round, cherries and plums, which are popular in the summer.
Several German baked sweets also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other shellfish. The most popular cakes are often very well accompanied by a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste small but flavorful sweets can go to the Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid in it.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is normally used for curries in the inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more common.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating in the central and eastern area of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a range of simple dishes; its predominant flavours are given by the use of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The sticks are supports for the rider's feet and hang on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but may present safety problems because the rider's feet may remain stuck in them.
If a horse bounces a horse but has a foot stuck in the stake, it could be dragged by the horse that escapes.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a height and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially the British ones, were fitted with safety bars, which cause a leather rod to detach from the saddle when, in case of fall, the rider pulls it back.
CochamÃ³ Valley: Chile's most important climbing destination, known as Yosemite in South America, where a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs are carved.

Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums" (ski bums), who dedicate entire holiday periods to skiing activity in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins in at least the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skiing: The activity is also called skiing, ski mountaineering or trekking on skis.
It is linked, although usually not included, to ski touring or skimming, which are practiced on rough terrain and require much stiffer skiing and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you can cover some distance longer than those trails by walking, but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on the treadmill.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries, and travel through several countries usually requires a visa and multiple passport checks.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to go through passport checks again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition of what makes a work of art an antique piece. Some tax agencies consider such an object to be at least 100 years old.

Craft items could be defined as antique items, although more recent than similar items produced in series.
Reindeer farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all SÃ¡mi people have been involved in large-scale reindeer farming; some lived by fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as working animals.
Today many SÃ¡mi people are pursuing modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the SÃ¡mi region.

The backflow of the waves breaking on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations, is the backflow of the backflow.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue in trying to swim against the current, which may prove impossible.
Once you're out of the water, swimming back won't be any harder than usual.
Try to identify an area where you are not at risk of being trapped again, or assess whether to wait for rescue, based on your abilities and whether you have been spotted.

When you return home from living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the uses of your native culture.
In your first experience abroad, you may have met patient and understanding people who are aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were also needed for those returning home.
The spectacle of sounds and lights from the pyramid is the most interesting thing in the area for children.

Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of an active volcano filled with water from its origin to a magnificent natural harbor.
The land of Ellsworth is the region south of the peninsula overlooking the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reemerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360-kilometer chain cut in half by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Chain, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a cell phone, because to call you must be outdoors with the view clear to the satellite.
The service is often used by recreational craft, including recreational craft, as well as by missions requiring data and voice at a distance.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the more popular options for those planning to take a sabbatical is to travel and learn.
It is particularly common among new graduates, since they can take up to a year before starting college without compromising their education.

Registration for these educational programmes usually requires payment of a fee.
Finland is an ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht to the archipelago and the lakes.

Boating is the national pastime of Finland, where one boat is counted for every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is rather rare (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).

To fly first class or business class the most obvious way is to pay a good price for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: indicative, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for business travel and up to eleven times the fare for first-class travellers!
In general, direct flights from A to B are not worth seeking first-class or business-class discounts.
Airlines are well aware that there is a category of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and as a result they apply certain fares.
