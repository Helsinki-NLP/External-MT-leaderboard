Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called troops.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The women are normally closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves almost as much as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly much like lions (but not other large cathogs), and that are very deadly to their prey.
Tigre is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances and has five times as much traction as a strong person.
Tigers belong to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars.
A tiger doesn't roar out of full power like a lion.

They can see very well in the dark through night vision and move very unnoticed. They hunt prey by uniting with the environment and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the large population from which they come (for example, by moving across a mountain range or river, or when they are moved to another island, from which they cannot easily return), they are often in a different environment than before.

As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.

Although most of their food would have been familiar to us, the Romans also had their serving of strange or unusual treats, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a kind of rodent called a sleeping mouse.

Ancient Roman meals contain no food that came to Europe in later centuries from America or Asia.

Sometimes, as part of the temples, pyramidal towers were built, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.


Women cooked in the garden; shops were nothing more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.

Greenland was still sparsely populated, and according to Norse legends, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west and gave it his name.
He made this discovery, but there were already Eskimos living there at that time.

The Americans and the Free French had liberated the south of France in just two weeks, and then they left for Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, meaning civilized, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which then stands for citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state; and this also defines in a certain way the size of society.
City states are the forerunners of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down through generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind, so they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolution, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation formed a weak central government, consisting only of a congress.
Congressional power to levy taxes was lacking because there was no national executive or judicial power and relied on government authorities for implementing all decisions who often refused to cooperate.
The Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a regulation on the application of the principle of equal treatment for men and women.
The first step was to have all the States unanimously agree to the articles before they could be amended, but the States did not take the national government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German team, and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Sports that are popular include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, swordfighting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are particularly popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (with the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often geographically referred to as a 'peninsula'

1624 the Dutch VOC established itself in southwestern Taiwan as a base of operations, where the VOC addressed the indigenous grain production processes and employed Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.

After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.

For example, the most commonly used image format for still images is 35 mm, which was the standard film format at the end of the analog film era.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

The image ratio of this size (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) would be 3:2 in that case.
Many common layouts (for example APS-like layouts) are similar to or close to this image ratio.
The third-party rule, which is widely abused and considered ridiculous by many, is a simple directive that makes the image dynamic, yet clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines.


From the king to the common citizen, his all-pervading power affected everyone.

The church was the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this ratio of power to money led many to question whether this principle was being followed.

Tesla emigrated to the United States in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a poem and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) for Thomas Edison.

There were fierce wars fought in those days between various nobles fighting for the throne.

The Revolution has had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism and the notion that the country belongs to its people instead of a single leader.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The same goes for the army, where ranks are no longer based on a person's class but on the person's caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class to revolution in other countries.

The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on one of the mountain tops on the north side of Mecca and is completely closed off from the rest of the world.
Even if the cave was known to exist, it was not easy to find it.
All you can see is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of the numerous great pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Plateau of Giza or 'Pyramids of Giza' in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples, and the great sphinx.

A group of market women was behind the departure of the death-stricken Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789.
They drove back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by mourning and threatening mobs that threatened the Royal couple.
The crowd's actions forced the king and queen to open the windows of their chariot completely.

The costs of the war of US imperialism in connection with the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the people of the Philippines.

To understand the Templars, one must know what the context was that gave rise to the order.
The period in which this occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).

Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from the supply of technology or the technological obligation to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: the development of technology follows a path that extends largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.

The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of road accidents.
The mass car ownership also causes a greater number of road accidents and this leads to the development of new healthcare techniques to restore the human body.
Romanticism incorporated a large part of cultural determinism, which came from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic period, geography shaped the individual and over time, customs and cultures emerged from this geography, which formed a harmonious society and were better than the arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the current fashion capital.

Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture in which sufficient food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture for subsistence is a simple system which is usually organic, using stored seeds from the ecoregion, combined with alternating crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.

Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
Subculture can be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or one or more of these factors combined.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to by a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave and in the jargon they speak.
One of the most commonly used methods of illustrating the importance of socialization was the few regrettable cases of children who, due to neglect, setbacks or willful abuse during their adulthood, were not socialized by adults.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children' Some werewolf children have been locked up by humans (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the child's severe mental or physical limitations.

In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
Internet brings together elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
The different characteristics of the Internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
"Learning" and "socialization" are, for example, proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal engagement' and 'continuous relationships' when they examined public responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to remarkable discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.

Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, described how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also possess the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research done in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variation; by selection this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, there is variation between the two groups by separation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can be found in the savannah but can hardly get the amino acids needed from the plant sources found there.

Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and a pursuit of universal love.
Yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is aroused.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as the focus. Using the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleaned up, chakras are activated and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, so the USSR and the US cooperated. When the war ended, the conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
The former allies were pitted against each other two years after the war ended, which was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last for 40 years and proxy fights took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
Polish defence forces held it only until 17 September 1939, when they had to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
The Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty and other international peace treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transportation of goods by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the task of the navy is to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while actually blocking the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
The United States tried to get British troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean and with this North Atlantic campaign of WWII this is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
The German Navy tried to stop this traffic using mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would have probably fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.

After the Declaration of Independence was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the John Dunlap printing house a few blocks away, signed by the President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson.
Overnight, 150-200 copies were made, which is now known as Dunlap broadsides.
John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9, and another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap flyers are the oldest surviving copies of the document.

But there are many things about birds that still remind me of a dinosaur.

Manipulating data encoded in binary digits is the basis for almost all computers in use today.
A binary number can have only two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers (and in computer language 'bits').

Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why are they failing every day? Are transport technicians just incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
The following information is provided by the European Parliament and the Council:
Unfortunately, it is difficult to examine traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Thankfully, drivers behave reasonably predictably, which means that traffic flows are consistent and there is something to be said about this mathematically.
The three core characteristics have been linked to better represent the traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.

Content theories are all about finding out what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they grow up.

Eventually, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
Often, this behavior leads to a rift between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are minor differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their direct physical group.
Often they are more independent than traditional team members, which is because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports.The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organisation want to start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? One of the goals for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity are shown when all available resources are used effectively within the functional departments of an organisation.
The result is that the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
