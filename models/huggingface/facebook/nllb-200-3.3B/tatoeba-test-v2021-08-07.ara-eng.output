And it is my belief, from my personal experience, that the partnership between America and Islam should be based on the truth of Islam and not on what is un-Islamic, and I see that as part of my responsibility as President of the United States to counter negative stereotypes about Islam wherever they appear.
And from it we can follow the algorithm.
And he that is angry with me shall be ashamed.
And given the interdependence of the world, any world system that puts one people or group of people above another is bound to fail, and no matter what we think about the past, we should never be prisoners of the past.
And these signs will follow those who believe: In my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new languages; they will embrace dead people; they will drink dead people's blood and never harm them; they will place their hands on the sick and they will be healed.
And everyone can contribute.
