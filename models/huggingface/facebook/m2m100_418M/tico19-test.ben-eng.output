European Union/European Economic Area and the UK rapidly increasing incidents of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from 1st January to 15th March 2020
Increasing events of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) show the same trends between the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the UK that ensures that although the country depends on being at different stages, the COVID-19 epidemic has progressed rapidly in all countries.
Based on the solid knowledge obtained from Italy, patients with COVID-19 who will need health care and need intensive care will need to increase the preparation of the country, hospitals and intensive care units for rapid growth.
On December 31, 2019, an unknown disease theory-related tumor occurred in the Uhan city of Hubei province of China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that Novel Coronavirus as an active ingredient is now referred to as severe intense respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in the disease named coronavirus disease (COVID-19) .
To date, evidence is that 80% of people affected by COVID-19 are mild diseases, i.e. respiratory infections with or without neumonia and most of them healed.
Among 14% of the infected, COVID-19 becomes a more severe disease that creates the need for hospitalization, while 6% of the infected suffer from a severe disease that requires intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this survey we are reviewing the trend of increasing events in each European Union/European Economic Region (EU/EEA) country and in the UK (UK) COVID-19 and comparing them to the Hubei province of China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 infected countries in the EU/EEA and the UK with the number of Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 events in EU/EEA countries and the UK
China's backdrop COVID-19 is more geographically spread and the COVID-19 transition mobility in the rest of the world is currently following this country.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as temporary on March 11, 2020.
In the number of March 5th of Euroservices 2020, Spitery and its partners the first European certified COVID-19 cases according to the WHO’s case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three of the people returning from Uhan in the Chinese Hubei province were confirmed by France on January 24, 2020.
By March 15, 2020, COVID-19 was detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths from December 31, 2019 to the specified date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
The increasing number of COVID-19 infected and the increasing scale
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reports on COVID-19 infections counted in every country around the world only from the Ministry of Health of countries, the national and regional health authorities and official sources such as the WHO, which is updated every day at 8:00 p.m.
These data were used to evaluate the trends of the EU / EEA and the UK COVID-19 and to compare with what happened in Italy.
As a proxy of the incidence of active COVID-19 events, we counted the short 14 days of COVID-19 increasing events, thus considering the natural path of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the increasing number of registered cases in each country from 15 March 2020 until 8:00 a.m., compared to Italian cases for the 31st January to 15th March 2020.
Trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
In the EU/EEA countries and in the UK, the short-term growth trends of COVID-19 in 14 days generally followed the trends of the Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the increasing occurrence of COVID-19 began to grow around 21th February and then increased sharply around 28th February 2020 (complete material).
It was mainly driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed the same tendency of increasing incidents of COVID-19 growth (replementary material).
Figure 2 compares the numbers of Italy with the increasing number of COVID-19 incidents in the EU/EEA countries and the UK for the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
It is remarkable that, from March 15, at 8:00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have already the comparable total infection in Italy only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results show that the number of known COVID-19 infections is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend observed in the increasing events of COVID-19 indicates that the epidemic is progressing at a comparative rate in all countries.
Although the countries are in different stages, although there are differences in national public health reactions, and the countries possibly have different definitions of infected and different protocols for the selection of patients which must be tested to ensure COVID-19 including catch-up testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the infected areas of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19-infected patients need intensive care (intensive care) and the media sources show that the hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on reception of COVID-19 infected in hospitals and / or an intensive care unit is currently available in only 6% and 1% of infected respectively at the EU / EEA level (data is not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to fill up the current surveillance data that focuses on the number of cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010–11 study conducted in the form of 4.2 beds for a population of 29.2 in Germany to 100,000 in Portugal showed a large difference between the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe.
This means that countries may be from less or more resources than Italy (2010–11 for every 100,000 people 12.5 Intensive Care and Intermediate Care Shares).
With the extent of COVID-19 cases hospitalized in each EU/EEA country and the UK, the modeling situation on health care capacity involvement has shown that the intensive care bed has a > 90% risk of exposure and is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC’s COVID-19 Fast Risk Assessment.
Since the events are still on the ground in the EU/EEA countries and in some regions of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units generally provide a specific regional service to the users of the public, it is desirable to use the method of nameing the regional units for the infected and intensive care bed data statistics level 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that COVID-19 is moving rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
So the country, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the continuing community of SARS-CoV-2 infection and health care needs and especially intensive care needs, such as in the affected regions of Italy, to increase the number of COVID-19 infected patients.
As indicated in the recent ECDC Fast Risk Assessment, SARS-COV-2 infection spread delay a quick, pre-active and all-time approach is essential, with a change in the approach from repression to relief, since unless implemented in advance, the expected rapid increase in the number of events may not even give the decision-making and hospitals sufficient time to understand, take and adapt their reactions accordingly.
Fast risk assessment also provides a list of public health-related measures to reduce the effects of epidemic.
There is a short period of time in which countries are likely to increase their efforts to control to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
If it fails to do so, there is a possibility that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in the number of patients in need of intensive care within the next few days or weeks.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed 3,000 people in China and the rest of the world, and more than 80,000 people have been infected, bringing a disaster to humanity.
Similar to the associated SARS-CoV virus, which caused SARS in a few thousand people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be infected from the bacteria and cause the same symptoms by the same method.
However, the intensity and death of COVID-19 is lower than SARS, but it is much more infectious and attacks more men than older people and women than young people.
In response to many rapidly expanding publications on the emerging disease, this article has sought to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the subject of rapidly evolving research.
We will include primary subjects about disease epidemiology, atology, virology, disease diagnosis, medicine, disease rate indicators and resistance.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the disease.
The spring festival of January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were asked to stay in their homes throughout the holidays and then for many weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly associated with coronavirus (CoV) which in 2003 caused severe severe respiratory associated syndrome (SARS); therefore, on February 11, 2020 it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19) .
The Uhan transition in China begins and rapidly spreads throughout the country and across more than 50 countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus caused more than 80,000 secure incidents of COVID-19, of which more than 40,000 patients were released and more than 3,000 patients died.
"WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy of the people" and probably more powerful than terrorism."
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months from the first report on January 7, 2020, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 have been published, including viruses, epidemiology, atology, disease diagnosis and treatment, determining the order of the virus separated from multiple patients.
This review has sought to summarize the progress of research in the new and rapidly evolving subject.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-generated disease, the Middle East respiratory-related syndrome (MERS, Mahamari in 2012).
We have discussed what we have known so far about disease prevention and forecast and some remaining but urgent questions with it.
CoVs are traditionally considered as pathogens that are not lethal in humans, which generate about 15% of the 4 common colds.
Of course, in this century, we have encountered twice the highly pathogenous biological human CoV, which is SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which began a epidemic in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively, and which soon spread to many other countries with terrible symptoms and mortality.
So, the current COVID-19 is the third recorded CoV occurrence in human history.
As shown in Figure 1, the sources of the neumonia cells were unknown were first from Uhan to the Chinese National Health Commission on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, CoV's sequence was published.
On January 15, 2020, the first deadly events in Uhan were.
Meanwhile, the epidemic rapidly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, healthcare providers were about infection, which indicated that infection from humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Uhan was locked down and all public transportation was closed.
The first study on the disease on January 24 stated that only 21 of 41 confirmed patients were in direct contact with the Uhan Seafood (marine food) market, which was considered the place of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the epidemic as a global health emergency.
Until the time of this report, the disease has already spread to China and more than 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation is rapidly expanding, the final degree and intensity of the occurrence remains to be determined.
On 11th February, 2020, 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, including 8,866 patients, presented a more up-to-date multicentric survey of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has been infected in people of all ages, but mainly in 30-65 years of age.
Nearly half of the infected people (47.7%) were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20 and only 14 of the infected people were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more than men (0.31/100,000) in women (0.27/100,000).
Mainly Hubei and its surroundings were spread by COVID-19.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the start to the diagnosis of the disease.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the start of the disease to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The initial reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the coordinated R0 was 2.23-4.82.
In line with the massive transportation time before the spring festival in China, the number of infected people before 23 January 2020 has increased rapidly.
The mortality rate in confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the combined mortality rate among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%)
The three main risk causes of COVID-19 are gender (man), age (≥60) and severe neumonia.
CoVs are a subgroup of large and swallowed viruses containing a single formula of sensory RNA.
They can be divided into four classes or genres, i.e. Alpha, Beta, Gama and Delta, among which Alpha and Beta CoV are known to infect humans.
Accordingly for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, glycoprotein is linked to its cell-consumer angiotensin-converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Dipeptidial peptide 4 (DPP4) and then the gland addition occurs.
Viral RNA genome is free in cytoplasma; after the creation of a copy of the viral genome, Envelp forms genome RNA viral-connected vesicles or gotika with glycoprotein and nucleocapside proteins, which then blends with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first phenomenon of SARS-CoV-2 was on January 10, 2020.
It has been known that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% of the 10 continuing samples collected from the Uhan Ocean Food Market.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is much more similar to SARS-CoV compared to MES-CoV.
Through the spread electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 cells were found in the extreme part of the human respiratory epithelium.
It was known that in addition to human SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV, human ACE2 was a receptor.
However, SARS-CoV-2’s S proteins are relatively weakly bound to human ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV, which concludes in the actual case that SARS-CoV-2’s infections are less severe than SARS-CoV-2’s.
SARS-CoV-2 forms a vibrant small protein encoded by orf3b and can also produce proteins encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b can play a role in the ability to cause viral diseases and inhibit the manifestation of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known fields of action or sputum.
On 18th February 2020, Zhu and others the creative-EM structure of human ACE2 with a full-length 2.9 Å resolution in mixed ingredients including the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that open and closed adapted mixed ingredients were combined as a dymmer, and the mixed ingredient ACE2-B0AT1 could bind two S proteins, which provide evidence for the recognition and infection of CoV.
For the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection, B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for pharmaceutical testing.
Primary and Medium.
It has been known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have originated from the bacteria and have spread to the human body, respectively, through civic cats and wheat.
By comparing a philogenetic of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the bull was considered a natural pet of SARS-CoV-2 since the new virus is 96% equivalent to CoVs such as two SARS obtained from the bull called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, what intermediate pet virus helped the species to overcome the barrier to infect humans is still unknown and the path of infection remains to be explained in detail.
Ji and others presented the serpent as a carrier of the virus to humans from the bear that was associated with the homologus regeneration in the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, indicated that long-sweetened pinguins, pinguins-CoV-2 and coV found in long-sweetened pinguins, commonly used in traditional Chinese medicines, are 99% genetic homology-based possible intermediate pinguins of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference that is spread in the two genoms is still a big difference; therefore, the conclusive results are still waiting for a strong evidence (Figure.
The psycho-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive 48 hours in a dry environment outside the body and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40%-50% moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat for 30 minutes at 56 °C; Ethereum, 75% Ethanol, chlorine-containing biochemicals, peracetic acids, chlorophorms and chlorhexidins can effectively disactivate the virus.
The entire human race generally has a deficiency in disease resistance to SARS-CoV-2, and therefore they are at risk of getting infected with the Novel virus.
There is currently no detailed study of SARS-CoV-2 reactions.
So we can only see previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoVs and MERS-CoVs (Figure 4.4).
Usually, after a virus has entered the pet, it is first identified by the animal's congenital immune system through the pattern identification receptors. All of these receptors include a C-type lectin-like receptor, a TOL-like receptor (TLR), a NOD-like receptor and a RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through various ways, the virus stimulates the expression of inflammatory substances, the maturity of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) which limit the viral infection and accelerates the macrophase of viral antigen phagocytosis.
However, the SARS-CoV’s N protein virus can help survive an immunity reaction.
Soon, appropriate disease resistance reactions also add to the fight against this virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in resistance.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce viral-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill viral-infected cells.
The T Helper cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help resistant cells.
However, CoV can prevent the activity of the T cell by provoking the death of the T cell.
The body's resistance, including supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also necessary to fight viral infections.
For example, separate antibodies from patients receiving cure prevent MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive sensitivity of the intestinal system generates a large number of free radicals locally that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst circumstances, multi-organ disturbance can even lead to death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by swelling, is more likely to cause damage to older people and pregnant women associated with the pre-sickness.
It is common that people who are in touch with a lot of viruses or whose resistance is weak are more likely to get infected than others.
Based on the study of the first 425 people infected in Uhan, the estimated average period of detection (incubation) of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, studies on 1,099 infected people showed that the period of infection (incubation) was an average of 3 days and the interval was from 0 to 24 days.
According to the above description, a recent study showed that 8,866 people affected based on the population, the period of exposure of the disease was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate time of detection of the disease, thereby preventing the viral infection from infected but non-symptomatic people to others.
As a common practice, people infected or in contact with the virus usually need to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Is it necessary to extend the quarantine time to 24 days?
In almost cases, fever is the main and primary symptoms of COVID-19, with which there may be no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, breathing, muscle pain, tenderness, headache, throat pain, renuria, chest pain, diarrhea, swelling and swelling.
A week after the start of the disease, some patients felt dyspnea (depression) and/or hypoxemia.
In severe cases, patients develop severe respiratory associated syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and cogulopathy.
Though patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever do not have even palmonary imagery abnormalities, the virus should be tested in the case of initial diagnosis of the disease.
A demographic survey at the end of December 2019 found that 98% of the symptoms were fever, 76% drought cough, 55% dyspnea and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
A cluster (family cluster) and a cluster (cluster) caused by infection from a non-symptomatic person have been similar discoveries in two recent studies.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic study found that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) .
However, 80% of them needed ventilation support, which is much greater than COVID-19 patients and is consistent with a higher MERS impact than COVID-19.
Diaries (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients it was shown that fever (99% -100%), dry cough (29% -75%), dyspnea (40% -42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat pain (13) -25%) were the main symptoms and about 14% -20% of patients needed ventilation support.
By February 14, the worldwide mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2% while the confirmed infected reached 66,576.
Comparatively, the death rate for SARS until November 2002 was 8.096% of confirmed cases.
For MERS, the death rate based on a demological survey in June 2012 was 2494 confirmed 37% of the infected.
An earlier study found that the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 was higher than the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 with the R0 of 6.47, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 in terms of symptoms, mortality rates and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above numbers indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infections are more likely to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less fatal than the other two.
Therefore, overtime control of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than overtime control of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Generally, the disease begins often in the same family or from the same collection or the same ship.
Often there is a history of patients travelling or living or experiencing symptoms in the last two weeks of contact with the infected person or patients.
However, reports have found that people can bear the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and healed patients released from the hospital can bear the virus again, which sends a warning to extend the time of quarantine.
In the early stages, the number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normal or low.
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients the number of white blood cells with lymphocytes <1 × 109 /L <4 × 109 /L with lymphocytes and elevated spiral aminotranspheric levels and viremia were found.For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients the number of white blood cells with lymphocytes <1 × 109 /L with lymphocytes and elevated spiral aminotranspheric levels and viremia were found in <4 × 109 /L with lymphocytes and elevated spiral aminotranspheric levels and viremia.
Some patients had increased levels of liver and muscle stimulators and myoglobin in the blood, and most patients had increased levels of C-reactive protein and erythrosite in the blood.
In patients with severe infection, the levels of D-dimer, which is a fiber deteriorating product present in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes increasingly decreased.
In most COVID-19 patients, abnormality of breast radiography is found and the lungs are characterized by bilateral incomprehensible shadows or insecurity of spinal glass.
Patients often experience non-symptomatic neumonia, severe lung injuries and severe respiratory-related disease syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid pollution and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchange.
The unusual action of type-I and type-II neumocytes reduces the levels of surfacant and increases the surface-tone, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of weakening of the lungs.
So, the worst type of chest radiographic searches are often observed: in the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the pathological analysis of COVID-19 found discomposition of neumocytes, hyalin membrane formation, interstitial lymphosite infiltration and multi-neucleated sensitive cells in the lungs of a person who died of this disease, which are compatible with viral infections and ARDS pathologies and similar in SARS and MERS patients.
The reverse-transcripted polymeration chain reaction (RT-PCR) used SARS-CoV-2 RNA identification as the main measure of the COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to a very high erroneous-negative rate, which may trigger the epidemic, from February 13, 2020 in China, clinical or clinical expression has begun to be used for diagnosis (which is no longer dependent only on RT-PCR).
The same situation has been observed in the case of SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the connection of the history of the disease, indication, laboratory examination and radiological investigation is essential and necessary for the effective determination of the disease.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a CRISPR-based Sherlock (SHERLOCK) strategy use protocol to determine SARS-CoV-2 which determines a separate part of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA using depths in less than an hour without the need for extended materials from 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter per input).
It is expected that the new strategy could dramatically increase sensitivity and utility when the indicative samples are verified.
Due to the lack of experience with Nevel CoV, the doctors can provide primarily assistant remedies to COVID-19 patients with prior use or various recommended therapies for treatment of other CoV-symbols such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
This therapy includes antiviral medications, antimicrobial reaction repression, steroids, plasma of patients healed, Chinese medications and psychological support for current and potential treatment.
It was also recommended to use plasma from patients receiving treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies have competed to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs in the beginning and also likely attacks other organs in low doses that exhibit ACE2 such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure and discomfort are the main threat and cause of death in patients.
Thus, the respiratory support is essential and it saves life, and it includes common oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, ventilation that is not to be cut and mechanical ventilation that is to be cut depending on the intensity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporal membrane oxidation (ECMO), which is an advanced cardiopulmonary bypass technology, which is used in the treatment of lethal heart disease or respiratory disorders.
It is also essential to maintain the electrolyte balance in SARS-CoV-2 patients, to prevent and treat indirect infections and septic shocks, and to protect the function of important organs.
It has been known that the excessive reaction of immunodeficiency among SARS and MERS patients is the result of cytokine disaster.
The cytoquin disaster is a form of inflammatory reaction that occurs through the release of cytoquin classes including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, and MCP-1.
These cytokins emit a huge number of free radicals through pathogenic cells, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organs delay.
Resistance response in the treatment of cytokine disaster is essential especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and toxilizumab, which is an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used for the treatment of cytokine disasters.
Other repressive therapies for cytokine disasters include T-cell-oriented repressive reaction correction; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blocks; JAK relief; blinatumomab (blinatumomab); cytokine signaling 4-inhibitors; and HDAC relief.
To reduce the intensity of inflammatory damage, steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS.
Although high medication steroids were not beneficial for severe lungs in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affect the possibility of healing.
However, short corticosteroid courses in low to medium doses are advised to be used with caution for seriously ill COVID-19 patients.
No effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed until the time of writing.
However, intervertebral application of Remedevir, including nucleotide analogues, has been shown to be effective for a US patient with COVID-19.
Remedeciv is a Novel antiviral drug, which was initially developed by Gilide for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlberg viruses.
Later, other single formulas, including MERS and SARS viruses, also showed resilience to RNA viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has supplied this compound to China to conduct a pair of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are highly anticipated.
Potential therapies for patients with severe respiratory symptoms are recommended as Baricitinb (baricitinb), Interferon-α, Lopinavir / Ritonavir and Ribavirin.
After combined therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir, diarrhea, swelling, swelling, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur.
The mutual action of this treatment with other medications used among patients should be carefully monitored.
Production of plasma and antibiotics from healed patients
There is a long history of blood collection from patients treated from infectious diseases to treat other patients affected by the same disease or to protect healthy people from infection.
In fact, healed patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood in terms of pathogens.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight bacteria and other external objects and they detect and directly mitigate the separate molecules of pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients treated with COVID-19 and injected in 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and with it the inflammation and viral load decreased and the oxygen involvement in the blood improved.
However, specific therapies have not yet been developed and verification and clarification are necessary to propose methods for large-scale use before it.
Also, in terms of medical effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, the antibodies can further stimulate the disease resistance reaction and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and there is a huge demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to quickly develop and produce antibodies at a certain stage to understand against a global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and fruitful to identify genetic codes to isolate B cells from healed patients and monitor effective antibodies against the necessary proteins of the virus or encode effective antibodies.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibiotics.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effects depend largely on the combination of multiple ingredients in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the TCM theory.
Most of the effective ingredients are unknown or unclear, as such ingredients or their favorable combinations are difficult to extract and verify.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with light to medium symptoms or for patients returning from severe stages.
For example, it was known that the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
In many states of China where COVID-19 patients were treated where TCM was used in 87% of patients where the highest rate of healing was found, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in the Hubei province, where COVID-19 patients were used in just about 30% of patients, the lowest rate of healing was found (13%).
However, this is a fairly obese comparison because the number and intensity of patients should be included in the assessment of many other influential issues such as the number and intensity.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a survey comparing WM and TCM combined treatment with Western Medicine (WM) treatment.
They found that body temperatures were significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than the WM+TCM group only needed to return to normal, remove symptoms and hospitalization.
Most attractedly, the degradation rate (light to intense) was significantly lower than the WM team only for the WM+TCM team (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower than the WM team only for the WM+TCM team (8.8% vs. 39%).
Despite this, TCM’s efficiency and safety are waiting for more controlled testing in larger levels and more centers.
It will also be interesting to identify the work process and, if possible, to clarify the effective ingredients of TCM treatment or their combinations.
Most patients with suspicious or confirmed COVID-19 feel extremely infectious and even deadly, and people in the quarantine also feel monogamy, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, cough and the adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to further anxiety and mental stress.
In the early stages of SARS, various types of psychiatric symptoms have been, including long-term depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor acitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
As part of the public health response to the occurrence of COVID-19, compulsory contact tracking and quarantine people may be more concerned and criminalised about the effects of infection, quarantine and their family and friends.
Thus, COVID-19 patients, suspects and those who have come into contact with them and as well as those who need mental health care should also be provided.
Psychological support should include the formation of a mental health team from multiple branches of medical science, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 inflammation and medical planning and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are necessary to prevent the infection chain from animal waters and infected humans to sensitive pet, and often they are an anti-viral treatment supplement in epidemic control caused by a viral virus.
S-protein-based vaccines have been developed to produce long-term and strong resistant antibodies against SARS-CoV and/or to create protective immunity.
Live-atenuated vaccines have been tested on animal models of SARS.
However, before the beginning of a medical study, the effectiveness of this drug in the body and its protection against viral infections spread to humans from animal sources in the elderly and the deadly-threatening model were not yet determined.
This is probably because SARS was destroyed 17 years ago and since then no new infections have been.
On the contrary, the dispersed incidents and MERS crashes continue in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the existence of junotic sources in the affected areas.
Inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticals, viral-sensitive particles and recombinant protein subunits have been prepared for MERS, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Preparing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent and important task for controlling the ongoing epilepsy for people who are not immune.
However, it is challenging to overcome this disadvantage due to the long time it takes for the development of the vaccine (an average of 18 months) and due to the dynamic changes in the coV.
As a pathogenic disease, the full course of COVID-19 has just begun to be fully developed for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients, except for the previous condition, can gradually get healing.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a much higher rate of disease and death in patients with severe infection.
Therefore, it is necessary to create a preventive model of this disease in favour of health agencies, especially in areas with limited resources, to give priority to their services.
Based on the previous study, the following factors may affect or may be associated with the rate indicator of the disease in COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important cause for the result of SARS disease, which is also true for COVID-19.
In a study of 8,866 infected people listed above, with 47.7% of those patients who were over 50, COVID-19 occurred mainly among people aged 30-65 years.
Patients who needed intensive care were also more likely to suffer from other diseases and complications, and they were significantly older than others (the middle age of 66 and the middle age of 51), which indicates the age as an indicator of the rate of the disease for the result of COVID-19.
Gender: Men's SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
The presence and complication of multiple diseases: Patients with COVID-19, who need careful care, are more likely to suffer from severe heart attack and arithmia.
Also heart attacks were the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has also been that the ACE2-positive collangeosite may also be linked to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in disadvantage of the liver in COVID-19 patients.
It should be remembered that age and inherent diseases are strongly connected and can interfere with each other.
Unusual data found in the laboratory: the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflect the intensity of inflammation or injury in the tissue and is proposed as an indicator of the rate of possible disease for disease, therapeutic response and final healing.
It was also proposed the interrelation of intensity and forecast of COVID-19 with the CRP level.
Also, increased lactate dehydrogenation (LDH), spartate aminotransferase (AST), allanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinesis (CK) can also help forecast the results.
These incentives are widely exposed in several areas, especially in the heart and liver, and are emitted during cellular damage.
Thus, these are the usual signs of heart or liver inactivity.
Main symptoms: Complicity and consequences of COVID-19 for prediction should be considered along with other problems, the periodic progress of breast radiography and symptoms.
Using steroids: The above description, to reduce the intensity of inflammatory damage, steroids are an immunosuppressant commonly used as an accessory treatment for infectious diseases.
Since high levels of corticosteroids were widely used among severe SARS patients, many subjects suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, including long-term disability and low quality of life.
So if necessary, COVID-19 patients should use steroids in low doses and for a short period of time.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic many patients often suffered long-term quarentine and extreme uncertainty and saw the deaths of close family members and patients including they had an unusual mental stress.
It is essential to provide psychological advice and long-term assistance to help these patients get rid of mental stress and return to normal life.
So far, according to demological studies, the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from SARS.
In addition to making copies in the lower end of the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively make copies in the upper end of the respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, which is similar to other CoVs responsible for common colds.
Thus, patients infected in the early stages or in the early stages of the epidemic can produce a lot of viruses during their daily work.
However, when patients become seriously ill, SARS-CoV infection was considered to occur, while most of the infection did not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current prevalence of COVID-19 is much more intense than the prevalence of SARS and it is also difficult to control.
Great efforts are currently ongoing in China, including the hopes of preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 disease in the locations of the Uhan and surrounding cities and the quarantine of the entire population.
Although these steps have dramatically damaged the economy and other areas of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, which indicates the slowdown of the overtime.
The most hopeful prediction is that the spread of the disease will end in the month of March and the lower stage of the disease will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so hopeful.
Paul Hunter and others predicted that COVID-19, which is becoming more infectious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others set a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group that healed and 2 weeks ago released from the hospital patients were both identified with SARS-CoV-2 in the mid-turbine and throat lalares, indicating that the newly identified virus would become the same cyclic phase as the flu.
However, on the basis of the growing number of new cases, hopeful indications are found in China, which indicates that current strategies may continue to work.
It was initially predicted that Ebola would cause one million infections, including half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarentine and separation, this disease has finally been kept under control.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infection may become weakened and eventually destroyed or become a relatively less infectious virus in conjunction with humans.
The comparison of SARS and MERS with the COVID-19 epidemic is shown below (Figure 55) .
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly infectious through cough or hemp and also through direct contact with substances possibly contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in the moles that highlighted the new possibility of infection from the moles to the mouth.
A recent study on 138 infected people said that 41% of infection cases were likely caused by nasocomial (hospitalized) infections, including 17 patients with other pre-sickness and 40 healthcare providers.
Thus, people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even persons present in the vicinity of patients or people affected, should take sufficient caution to protect.
The mask can be used as the first stage of defense to reduce the risk of infection; the use of surgical mask and N95 respiratory related mask (Series # 1860s) helps to control the spread of viruses.
The surgical face mask prevents the spread of small spots of fluid from a potentially infected person through the air or being stuck on the surface of the object, from where they could spread among others.
However, only N95 (Series # 1860s) masks can protect from taking small viruses such as 10 to 80 nm by breathing, only 5% of viruses are able to enter fully; the size of SARS-CoV-2 is equal to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can enter through even five consecutive surgical masks, healthcare providers who come directly into contact with patients should not wear surgical masks, but N95 (Series # 1860s) masks.
In addition to the masks of healthcare providers to further reduce contact with viruses, appropriate insulation gowns should be worn.
The virus can also infect a person through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he was wearing the N95 mask; the virus was likely to enter his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear a transparent face cover or clothes when patients work.
In the case of the population in the affected or potentially affected areas, everyone is advised to wash their hands with more frequent antibiotic soap than usual, to try to stay inside the house to quarantine themselves and to limit contact with potentially infected persons at high levels.
A distance of three feet is considered appropriate to stay away from a patient.
This adopted system is an effective method to reduce the risk of infection as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came into the human world as a new virus, according to January 7, 2020’s report, China should take high warning based on the deep memory of the 2003 SARS occurrence due to its high similarity to SARS-CoV.
However, until January 19, 2020, the Director of the Uhan Disease Control Center comforted citizens that the Nevel virus is less infectious and is limited to the reproductive capacity between humans and there is no problem in preventing and controlling the disease.
This message significantly relieved the fear of the public, especially when the whole country was preparing for the spring festival and a significant time was lost to suppress this disease at a minimum level.
China’s disease control agencies can take this rigorous training and can make essential improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious when announcing publicly because each word will be considered by citizens and it may change their attitudes and decisions; (2) doctors or officials should be more sensitive and responsive to the unwanted information obtained from clinics without waiting for official reports; (3) they should be more controlled to suppress potential epidemic at the initial stage rather than to try to comfort the public; and (4) they should be more controlled to increase the awareness of the public about epidemic, and they should be more sensitive and responsive to the processing and processing of the processing and processing of the processing and processing of the processing.
The prevalence of COVID-19 caused by the Nevel virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and during the writing of this report it spread to more than 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar to the symptoms, the prevalence of COVID-19 has created a feeling of the return of SARS.
However, there are some noticeable differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are necessary for epidemic repression and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects men more than young people and women, and the intensity and mortality rates are also higher than older people than young people.
SARS death rates are higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients also infect the virus in signsless conditions, while SARS patients usually do so in severe diseases, which makes it much more difficult to suppress COVID-19 infection than SARS.
It partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and faster than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA assessment for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients receiving healing may be positive again in the case of the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of virus spread.
Considering such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, there are several important issues left to be solved as follows:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bites of SARS-CoV, we are still unable to reach the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 comes from the bacteria.
What kind of animal was intermittent to infect viruses among humans from primary pets, such as pets?
Without knowing the answers of #1 and 2, we will not be able to effectively reduce the spread of infection and the spread can return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assessments have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, how exactly the virus enters the respiratory cell and causes subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also block the ACE2-personal cells of other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we will not be able to get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will it last?
How is the virus genetically spread in humans?
Will it become a worldwide epidemic, death like SARS or recurrence like heart flu for some time?
It is essential, but it takes some time to find answers to the above and many more questions.
But no matter what the price it claims, we have no other way than stop the epidemic as soon as possible and bring our lives back to normal.
Animal sources of human coronavirus
Conversion and adaptation for thousands of years has led to the coronavirus (CoV) and co-evolution of their pets among humans.
Before 2003 two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known as the cause of light diseases such as common serum.
The incidences of severe intensive respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) showed the currency backward to reveal how devastating and fatal HCoV infection could be.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 brought CoV to the top of discussions again and surprised us by showing higher infection and lower infection compared to our sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal-based disease and can help us understand the junotic source of HCoV.
The majority of HCoVs are derived from butterflies where they are less infectious.
Some of the HCoV-Samues are also known as intermediate sections of refugees.
In the prevention of human diseases, animal pet detection has a direct effect.
CoV-assignment in animals can also give an important insight into the pathogenity of CoV in humans.
In this review, we provide a brief description of the existing knowledge of the seven HCoVs, along with the history of their discovery as well as their animal sources and interrelated infections.
Importantly, we compare and compare different HCoVs from the point of view of viral evolution and genome re-connection.
In this context, the current CoV Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has been discussed.
Also, the need for a successful refuge change and the effects of the viral evolution in the severity of the disease are also noticed.
Coronavirus (CoV-Samuh) belongs to the family of coronavirus, it contains a group of covered, positive-sensitive, single-standarded RNA viruses.
"These viruses, which refuge the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobes among the RNA viruses, were named "CoV" because of the cough-national organs under the electron microscope."
Structuously, the CoV-substance has an inseparable genome that is of the same organization.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlaping open reading frame (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicated polyprotein (translation).
Polyprotein is processed to produce another 16 non-structured proteins, which are called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins which include clocks (S), clocks (E), clocks (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some line-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lines of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, CoV is classified into four quantities (Alpha-Covie, Beta-Covie, Gama-Covie and Delta-Covie), the majority of which contain HCoV in Beta-Covie and it is divided into four generations (A, B, C and D).
Genetic evidence has shown that bears and mice act as a gen source for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main species of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoV-Samuha has constantly overcome the intergenital obstacle and has manifested itself as a number of major human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been known.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, CIVIR ACUT RESPIRATOR SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 generally cause light signs such as common swelling and / or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogensic, causing severe respiratory disorder infections (acute respiratory disorder syndrome, ARDS) and more likely exposure outside the lungs compared to more patients with severe low respiratory infections.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814 was collected from the nasal output of commonly prescribed patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which have self-limited signs.
In fact, the idea was widely accepted until the SARS occurred that HCoV infections were generally unnecessary.
The 2003 SARS occurrence was one of the most devastating events in recent history, infected 8,000 people and the unreparated death rate was about 10%.
Ten years later, the epidemic continued in the Arab Peninsula as a result of the prevalence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and spread widely to the rest of the world.
2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is an active agent of the current coronavirus epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) which resulted in more than 3,120 deaths by March 3, 2020 and more than 91,000 people were infected.
The time of danger is running and the world has to be prepared for the upcoming transition of SARS-CoV-2.
Each of the seven HCoV cattle contains animal sources from cattle, mice or domestic animals.
Several evidence supports the evolutionary source of all HCoVs from the bacteria, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathic but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
The natural history, the driving power and the causes of the limitation of moving from species to species (spice jumping) provide a structure for the search for animal sources of the HCoV-Smoke.
With topics that are important to the prevention of future spyware, it can guide or lead the search for SARS-CoV-2 sections, intermediate and growing animal refugees(s).
In this review, we present an abbreviation of the animal source of HCoV, inter-national infections and pathogenicity.
In particular, we want to look at this general context and discuss that parental HCoV viruses are generally pathogens among their natural species refugees but are pathogens after entering the body of the new refugees.
We also review the evolutionary trends of HCoV where infection often decreases as infection increases.
The results of the current SARS-CoV-2 occurrence have also been discussed in this context.
The animal's CoV-sum has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first collection of HCoV-229E stone B814 from the nasal output of common cold patients, various CoV-sets were collected from various infected animals including turks, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Over the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
An abbreviation of the history of the discovery of HCoV in a colonial sequence (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
The first HCoV-229E strain was separated from the respiratory tract of patients infected with upper respiratory infection in 1966 and was later adapted to increase the line of the WI-38 lung cells.
In patients infected with HCoV-229E, common cold symptoms, including headache, swelling, illness and throat pain, were observed, and in 10-20% of cases fever and cough were observed.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was collected from organic cultivation and subsequent repeated growth of the virus in the brain of milk mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to the symptoms caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be markedly separated from the infection of other pathogens of the respiratory tract, such as the flu A virus and the rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both worldwide spread and are mainly infected in the winter climate in the summer season.
Usually, the prevalence of these two viruses is less than a week, then about 2 weeks of disease.
A human volunteer study found that healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a lightly common cord.
Only some patients with impotence disorder had severe low respiratory infections.
"SARS, also known as "atypical neumonia", was the first in human history documented HCoV-based epidemic and its principal representative was SARS-CoV, which was the third discovered HCoV."
The first SARS case was found at the end of 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
The SARS epidemic has 8,096 incidents across many countries and continents, of which 774 have died.
In addition to super-spreders, it was estimated that each case, including the incubation period of 4 to 7 days and with the appearance of the 10th day of the disease, as well as showing the final signs of viral load, could increase about two additive cases.
In patients infected with SARS-CoV, muscle pain, headache, fever, discomfort and colds are primarily seen as a delayed sign of breathing, coughing and breathing.
Lymphopenia, distorted liver function tests and extended creatine kinesis are the abnormalities of the general laboratory of SARS.
Distributed alviolary loss is also observed among patients with SARS, the spread of the subcutaneous cells and the increase in macrophase.
Approximately 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation in the subsequent period.
In addition to the low respiratory tract, multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, the liver and kidneys, can be infected in cases of severe events, usually with them cytokine disorders that may be severe especially in patients with imminent intestinal delay.
An indicator traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong was first collected from the patient's relatives' open lungs biopsy.
Since then, a lot of effort has been devoted to HCoV research.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was collected from a 7-month child in the Netherlands.
It was primarily common among young children, elderly and respiratory ill patients whose disease resistance was low.
Common diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 in corrosion, eye awakening, fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the collection of the same virus from an onusic sample of a 8-month-old boy with neumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was marked in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 is characterized as the cause of about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and is most common in summer, spring and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also known as a group.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was collected from a 71-year-old person with pneumonia and bronchialitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to group-acquired neumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been known to be associated with severe pancreatic disease.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, which is the cause of mild respiratory related diseases.
These four-group-acquired HCoVs all well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to be converted to causing high pathogenic diseases, although unknown causes have occurred accidents, such as the rare occurrence of the highly harmful sub-type of HCoV-NL63, which has recently caused severe infection of the low respiratory tract in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs gain the ability to functionally infect and maintain themselves in humans, they become relatively less harmful or infectious.
In 2012, MERS-CoV was first collected from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who prevented severe neumonia and rectal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although the majority of the events that are in the laboratory came from the Middle East, cases from outside have been in various European countries and Tunisia, sometimes in close contacts, including second-step expansion.
In 2015, another second-stage incidence occurred in South Korea, where 186 confirmed cases were found.
Characterized by progressive severe neumonia, MERS' indicative manifestations are similar to SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also experienced severe renal disturbance, which is unusual to date in the case of MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms of stomach diseases such as diarrhea and swelling.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratories confirmed that more than 34.4% death rates occurred, making MERS-CoV one of the most fatal viruses for the human body.
From the middle to the end of December 2019, categories of patients infected with neumonia were identified in the Uhan city of Hubei, China, as related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The ongoing prevalence of low respiratory infections caused by the World Health Organization SARS-CoV-2 has been declared a public health emergency of international concern and has called the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, with an approximately 3.4% death rate, 90.053 incidents worldwide have been confirmed.
Importantly, the mortality rate in China in the Hubei case is 4.2%, while outside of it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV presented as fever, cough and respiratory.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Neumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and an intense respiratory crisis can progress rapidly into the syndrome.
Although 82% are very similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 due to high nucleotide sequence homology, they cluster in various branches of racial trees.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be relatively less infectious but more infectious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has been in signsless cases and may play a role in rapid spread throughout the world.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs shows a great comparison of interest and differences.
First of all, the period of detection of the disease and the period of the course of the HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trends of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the intensity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four HCoV infected in the public (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63)
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows the characteristics that are commonly seen during the course of infection of the community-acquired HCoV-cells with non-specific, light or even non-symptomatic presentations.
On the other hand, a small portion of severe cases of COVID-19 also show signs of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly low.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 infection group shows curious characteristics of both acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the group-accepted HCoV.
On the other hand, it remains to verify whether SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have a decrease in infection after response in humans as well as SARS-CoV-2.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 moles can be identified in samples.
At least in some circumstances, it remains clear by future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 infections play an important role in cases like SARS-CoV.
It is interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2, like the community-acquired HCoV, is exactly the same as seasonal dependency.
However, SARS-CoV-2’s characteristics, including its infectiousness, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after reaction in humans, will influence the final result of the ongoing spread of COVID-19.
The four group-acquired HCoVs that create mild symptoms have adapted well to all people.
From another point of view, it may also be true that people have taken well in these four HCoVs.
In other words, both of the old HCoV may be a resident.
The HCoV-some causes severe diseases in humans and the people who have developed severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
To do so, HCoVs need to make a sufficient amount of copies among people to accumulate adaptative persons that fight against the causes of asylum restrictions.
In this sense, the longer the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 will last and the more people will be infected with it, the more likely it will be fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adjusted, it will be difficult to stop its infection in the human body by quarantine or other measures of infection control.
For many years, four group-acquired CoV has spread into the human population, and generally resistant patients have been causing the outbreak of common cystitis.
These viruses do not require any species of animals.
On the contrary, highly infectious SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted among humans and their infection among humans cannot beined.
In their junotic sections they need to beined and spread, and possibly seek the opportunity to spread to tolerable human targets through one or more intermediate and expanding pets.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics that are similar to both SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoV.
At least so far, it is very infectious as the community-acquired HCoV.
However, it is more infectious than group-acquired HCoV and less infectious than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It should be seen whether it is fully adapted to humans and whether it is spreading among humans without any kind or intermediate animal.
Before discussing the animal source of the HCoV, we will benefit from discussing the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, genetic, intermediate and expansion refugees of the HCoV.
An animal acts as an evolutionary pet of HCoV if it provides refuge to a close-related ancestor by sharing higher homologies at the level of the nucleotide order.
The epileptic virus is usually well adapted to the body of this refuge and is non-pathic.
Thus, a section refugees provide HCoV with uninterrupted and long-term refuge.
In both cases, refugees are naturally infected and they are natural refugees of HCoV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV is newly acquainted with an intermediate refuge before or exactly around the person, it doesn’t eat well with the new refuge and is often malignant.
This intermediate refuge can act as an animal source of human infection and can play an extender refuge in transmitting the virus permanently and then extending the levels of human infection through infection in the human body.
If HCoV cannot keep infection in the intermediate refuge, the infection may be accelerated.
On the contrary, HCoVs can also be adapted to the intermediate cloth and can begin long-term procrastination.
In this case, the middle puppy becomes a natural puppy.
Epidemiological data revealed the facts that the SARS index was the history of the animal's contact with the incident.
The subsequent survival studies have shown that an anti-SARS-CoV IgG was more prevalent among animal traders than the general population.
In the fragrance (Paguma Lervata) and living animal markets, a racon dog was first identified to carry a virus like SARS-CoV which was almost similar to SARS-CoV.
It was indirectly supported by the information that no SARS incident was known after the markets killed all the fragrances.
However, it has been known that wild or farm masked palm seeds without contact with the living animal market were primarily negative for SARS CoV, which indicates that masked palm fragrances will only act as intermediate breeding refugees but not as a natural spectrum of SARS-CoV.
Importantly, since 80% of different species of animals on the Guangzhou market contain anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals may also act as an intermediate breeding pet of SARS-CoV cannot be excepted.
These are all considered as the one-sided pets of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search for the natural pet of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, known as the SARS-related reinolophase bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese horse bat. The subsequent search revealed a closely related bat CoV, the SARS-related reinolophase bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese horse bat.
These bulbs are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the gene sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other beans share the 88-92% nucleotide sequence with the SARS-CoV homology.
These studies have created a new foundation for the idea that worms provide refuge to emerging human diseases.
CoV-some (SL-CoV-some) such as several SARSs have been detected from the bacteria, but no one can be collected as a viral virus except a nominated WIV1.
The human angiotensin converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the client of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 is shown to be a receptor for entrance to the WIV1 cell received from the sample of wheat and human ACE2 for use.
Curiously, SARS-infected patients were able to deactivate the WIV1 serums.
Until now, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestors of SARS-CoV in the bacteria, which shares 95% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Although these two viruses have a high-level homology, it is generally believed that WIV1 SARS-CoV is not an immediate parental virus and the bacteria are not an immediate subsidiary of SARS-CoV.
Filogenetic analyses classify MERS-CoV in the same class as Bat CoV-HKU4 and Bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV viruses use the same host receptor, Depptidil peptide 4 (DPP4).
RNA-dependent MERS-CoV's RNA polymerage ranges are philogenetically close to the patterns of Bat-Beta-CoV detected from Europe and Africa.
Until now, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bears.
MERS-CoV and its closest relatives CoV-HKU25 only share 87% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Thus, pimples may not be the immediate sections of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, Middle Eastern studies have shown that one-wheat wheat is serophytic for MERS-CoV specific relieving antibodies, just like the Middle Eastern sources in several African countries.
The MERS-CoV, similar to the virus obtained in humans, was collected from the mouth of the mouth’s nose, which further indicates that the mouth acts as the real portion of the MERS-CoV.
It is also remarkable that butterflies experimentally infected by MERS-CoV generally have light signs, but a lot of viral spread (virus shading) has been observed.
Signally, infected warts spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the oral pathway, which is also the main way to spread the virus from the warts.
However, the questions remain because before the symptoms began, many of the MERS’s confirmed infected people had no history of contact with the wheat, possibly from humans to humans, or from the path of infection associated with the species of unknown animals that refuge MERS-CoV.
The battery CoV RaTG13 collected from the rhinolophase affinite is 96.2% similar to SARS-CoV-2's nucleotide homology.
Like in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too high in favor of determining parental relationships.
This means that if there is no near-equal bat CoV in the future, the bulbs may not be the direct part of SARS-CoV-2.
Probably, the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal refugees should be among the wild animals sold and killed on the wholesale market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were related, which indicates a potential animal-to-human infection event.
A number of recent studies, based on methynomic sequencing, have suggested that a group of dangerous small mammals known as Bonnroy (Manis Javanika) may also carry SARS-CoV-2-related petrial beta-CoVs.
The 85-92% of these neural coV genoms are equivalent to the SARS-CoV-2 homology.
However, with approximately 90% homogeneity in nucleotide sequence levels, they are equally associated with RaTG13.
They binding the same receptor binding domain (RBD) with a 97.4% amino acid sequence identity with a SARS-CoV-2 in the genetic tree into two sub-parts of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in the genetic tree.
On the contrary, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more distorted, although the sequence homology has a higher degree of genome.
A previous study of sick gonorrhoids also the uninterrupted sequence of the virus from lung samples, which has been shown to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, various assembly methods and manual presentations were adopted to create partial genocides with about 86.3% part of the full-length viral genome.
We can’t exceed the possibility that panholin is one of the most intermediate animal pets of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence of support for SARS-CoV-2's direct forest source due to the sequence separation between the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV group.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than the beta-CoV-summers related to SARS-CoV-2 and wild SARS-CoV-2.
The pathway of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet established among cattle, pinguins and other mammals.
Although the most sequence homologies have been found between SARS-CoV-2 and RBDs of Bonruye, the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the most gene-related sequence homologies.
It’s extremely distant that the forest is driven by the RBD-related beta-CoVs of SARS-CoV-2 and the high likelihood of selectivity-intermitted ecstasy evolution between SARS-CoV-2.
A reversal proposal is in favour of the reconciliation between a wild SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 among the third wild species.
As a driving force in evolution, the re-connection between the beta-CoV is extensive.
There is still no accurate information about the direct animal source of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to high-pathic HCoVs, animal sources of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Filogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were derived from bat CoVs, although parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in mice.
It is known that HCoV-NL63, identified in the North American triangle, has shown a bit of coV, known as ARCoV.2 (Apollan Ridge CoV), that has a close relationship.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another battle called hipposiderosis / Ghanakowam /19/2008, although comelids have also been suspected as its intermediate pet.
For transparency, the knowledge of the animal source of HCoV is shortened in Current Knowledge in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Genetic analysis has provided evidence of events of inter-spesial infection of CoV-some in history.
In the 1890s, when HCoV-OC43 species transmitted and infected humans from domestic animals, a respiratory disorder was observed.
The history of inter species infection of HCoV-229E is relatively less clear.
HCoV-229E has been closely linked to the HCoV-229E.
Among them there is a Alpaca-Alfa CoV.
Several evidence supports the infection of the virus from the bacteria to the human body.
First of all, the shared ecological environment may be from the contact of the puppies with humans but not with alpaca.
Instead, people have close contacts with Alpacker.
Secondly, the HCoV-229E-related pimples are diversified and non-pathic among the alpha-CoV pimples, while the alpha-CoV infected animals cause the prevalence of respiratory disorders.
Finally, Alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpha-CoVs receive HCoV-229E related from humans cannot be excepted.
In fact, butterfly is a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including Rebecca virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
So it’s not surprising that pimples can infect HCoV-229E directly in humans.
On the other hand, the alpha-CoV-Samuel acts as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, but the alpha and one-CoV warts can serve as intermediate refugees that infect viruses in humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV acts as a great example of spreading interpersonal infections among humans from a cabbage to a cabbage to a cabbage.
The evolutionary source of MERS-CoV is known in the initial detection and is more solid by subsequent research.
It is clear that the bears provide a rich variety of viral species for inter-national exchange of genetic sections and inter-national infections.
Long-lasting, strangely full colonies, close social delivery and strong flight skills are the favourable conditions of becoming the ideal 'virus spreader' of the bear.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in touch with a curved wheat a few decades ago.
It’s well mixed with these butterflies that have become a stable and natural species refuge from an intermediate refuge.
MERS-CoV causes a very light disease andins a relatively low infection rate among these animals.
Its spread infection in humans is an accident and humans remain the last refuge of MERS-CoV because its infection cannot be survived.
Contrary to the role of wheat in MERS-CoV infection, it is different if the role of pancolin is in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Particularly, PANGOLINE BETA-CoV-SUMH is highly infectious among PANGOLINS.
In the case of SARS-CoV, they may be the last refugees for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs similar to fragrances.
Different possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 infection from inter-national animals to humans may be included or can be cancelled in future studies.
First of all, bulbs can be a rescue of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus that is almost similar to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share environmental columns with butterflies through wheat or coal mining.
Secondly, forests may be one of the intermediate expansion refugees where a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has been introduced.
People are infected with the virus by cutting and eating the cattle’s meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are unprotected in SARS-CoV-2.
A study of domestic and wild animals for antibodies has been confirmed.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the reorganization and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur among the third species which have contact with both the bacteria and the pinguin.
Search for the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to different species of animal refugees, the three main factors of the viral side are also important in helping CoV shoot to overcome inter-national obstacles.
First of all, their relatively high output rates per RNA.
"In comparison with other single-formed (stranded) RNA viruses, the estimated expression rate of the CoV-substance can be considered from "mediate" to "high" depending on the decade of Novel's CoV adjustment and the average replacement rate ~10-4 replacement will be 2 per site each year."
CoV-substance contains a proof-reading exoribonuclease, the result of the removal of which is excessively higher variability and weakness or even inability to survive.
Interesting is, it is known that the nucleotide analog remedevic forms CoV by mitigating this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remedev is one of the most likely anti-SARS-CoV-2 elements tested in subjective trials.
However, the personality rates of the CoV-subjects are about a million times higher than their refugees.
Furthermore, when the CoV-Samuel cannot fit well with the cloth, the conversion rate is often higher.
Compared to SARS-CoV with higher expression rates, the expression rate of SARS-CoV-2 is suddenly lower, which gives an indication of easier adaptation to humans.
Probably, it’s already in touch with another refugees close to people.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also applicable to MERS-CoV, which is well mixed with a peanut butter.
Theoretically, the genetic drop of SARS-CoV-2 is extremely low likely to quickly disable vaccines and antiviral drugs.
Secondly, the large RNA of CoV uses extra flexibility in the gene for genome expression and re-connection, thereby increasing the possibility of evolution, including interrelated, which is favorable to the rise of the CoV-substance when the situation becomes convenient.
It is supported by a lot of unique encoded open reading frame and protein function on the 3′ edge of the genome.
"Third, CoV-substance accidentally and often changes the templates when copying RNA through a unique ""copy-like"" process."
There is often a string switching during the course of coV RNA copying where the refugees operate as a mixed container.
Higher homogeneous full length and spine-based RNAs can re-connect to create new CoV-somes.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural reproduction was found both in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animal CoV-sams such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
The interaction of the virus-powerers related to infection
In addition to the three viral components described above, viral transmission with host receptors is another major cause of influential interspesial infection.
Among these, the recurrence of SARS-CoV is taken as an ideal example, which also demonstrated positive choices when interspesial infections occur.
Based on comparative analysis in the collection of human and fragile SARS-CoV, it is believed that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to the personality of the RBD of S protein among different refugees.
Usually, a CoV’s S protein interact with the RBD cell receptor and is severely selected by the host antibiotic reaction.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD is contained in the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 piece, which is also connected with human ACE2 as well as its corisectors for viral entrance.
SARS-CoV’s RBD is able to recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including cows, cows, mice and rabbit dogs, which can cause inter-national viral infection.
In fact, only 6 remains of amino acids have been found to differ from humans and RBD smelled viral isolates, and 4 of them are located in customer-friendly design to interact with ACE2 customers.
Civite SARS-CoV RBD contains K479N and S487T expression, which can increase the authenticity of spike protein transmission with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids can be serious for viral adaptation among humans.
It is noticeable that the cell consumers of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are equal.
A 30% difference between the S1 units of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV's S protein indicates that the tendency to bind its S protein to human ACE2 may change.
In fact, a creative-EM study indicates a tendency of 10 to 20 times higher bonds than the tendency between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It is also necessary to determine whether any other recipient may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Worriedly, HCoV-NL63 is also linked to ACE2, but with a separate part of S.
There are many more HCoV clients, such as HCoV-229E aminooptides N and 9-O-acetylated chemical acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also become the cause of successful adaptation of this CoV in humans after they are infected from their animal refugees to interpersons.
In addition to cell receptors, the results of inter-national infection with HCoV are also managed by factors of dependence and restriction on other refugees.
The division of these host proteins between humans and HCoV species can prevent interspesial infection, such as pimples, a pimples and mice.
HCoVs need to occupy the factors of refuge dependency for a successful interspesial infection and destroy the factors of refuge restriction.
In this case, it remains to identify and describe the character of the molecular determiners in this important case of viral donors.
Using CRISPR’s up-to-date technology, a neutral genome-based screening of rescue dependency and restrictions for SARS-CoV-2 can be fruitful.
The rise of Novel HCoV: Return from where it started
The diversity of the Bat CoV-Smoke provides sufficient opportunities for the rise of the Novel HCoV-Smoke.
In this sense, the Bat CoV-Smoke acts as the HCoV-Smoke gene pool.
Furthermore, rapid infusion and genetic re-connection lead to the evolution of HCoV and acts as two important steps in this process.
For example, Nevel has the ability to acquire protein-coding genes or seriously repair lost viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV additive proteins, ORF8 was considered important in adapting to humans because SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were collected but they were shown to encode affected ORF8 proteins.
A 29-neucleotide removal characteristic of the SARS-CoV-substance was found in the strens collected at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and it looks like an adapted entity that encourages refuge shift.
Also, there is a history of possible reorganization of SARS-CoV with the Alpha and Gama-CoV tribes, where a huge number of small reorganized areas were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymaries.
Repeated positions were also marked in the parts of nsp9, most nsp10 and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic passed through the events of re-connection between different tribes, which occurred in the case of a covet in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recomposition events have been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoV performs recomposition with other animal CoVs in their non-structured genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection may contribute to unintentional changes in the viral genome, possibly as a result of the release of viruses from elective pressures such as the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full length of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype form due to the removal of di-neucleotide.
Though orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane orphane.
Last but importantly, the evolution of the Novel HCoVs is also driven by the pressure of the election to their seed.
When the worms were infected by CoV, they were signsless or their only light signs were detected,which indicate mutual adaptation between the CoV-sugar and the worm.
It has been shown that the bears eat well with the coV from the direction of creation and physically.
For example, the failures in activating the reaction to inflammation in the bacteria effectively reduce the pathology driven by the CoV-sugar.
Furthermore, the repressive natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low levels of molecular expression of the main histocompatibility complex of class I have under pressure the activity of the natural killer cell in the bacterium.
On the other hand, both these can be suppressing the high-level reactive oxygen species (ROS) CoV derived from the high metabolic activity of the butterfly and influencing the prophoridation by exoribonuclease, thereby providing the pressure of the selection necessary for the production of viral strens when in contact with a new refuge.
More pathogens can also be developed through re-synthetics that lead to the achievement of new protein or protein character for refuge adaptation.
Thus, the likelihood of the development of three new HCoVs in the last two decades is not random.
CoV-Samuel creates mild signs in non-patient or their species refugees, such as cracks and cracks.
They grew strongly without the strong resistance of the refugees.
The secret of why unsymbolic carrier is seen and what serious incidents occur in human infection is found in it.
The severe symptoms are mainly caused by the excess activation of the disease resistance reaction and cytokine stroke where the stronger the resistance reaction, the more severe the lung damage.
On the contrary, in the case of non-symptomatic carriers, the resistance reaction is separated from CoV.
The same method of disconnecting resistance reaction can have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon reactions are strong.
Therefore, the application of type I interferon at least at the first stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the inflammatory activation of NLRP3 in the bacteria is defective.
By this reason, the resistant to NLRP3 inflammation, including MCC950, may be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common subjects by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were raised.
On the one hand, a bat beta-CoV was found that delivered 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, and on the other hand there was a bat-CoV that delivered 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although smell cells and other animals found on the market have been to provide refuge to SARS-CoV-like viruses, immediate intermediate refugees for SARS-CoV-2 were not identified.
Strangely associated with SARS-CoV-2 wildlife beta-CoV has been found, indicating that wildlife will act as one of the intermediate refugees or wildlife beta-CoV may contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions are coming from, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by man.
Due to the recent prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have returned to the center of discussion again.
The study of CoV-symptoms among cattle and other animals has significantly changed our idea of the importance of animal sources and HCoV-symptoms in human infection.
A wide range of evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bacterial source and are infected in humans through intermediate refuge.
Since the SARS-CoV infection arises from the contact between humans and smellers on the market, killing smellers there by closing the weight market could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By the same reason, pandolins should be removed from the heavy markets in order to prevent animal infection in the context of the discovery of multiple tribes of pandoline beta-CoV related closely to SARS-CoV-2.
However, what and how SARS-CoV-2 is infected in humans through wildlife and other mammals remains clear in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long existed in a curved wheat.
These wheels, in addition to important means of transportation, also serve as the main source of meat, milk, skin and peanut butter for local people.
They spread across the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all the cattle for MERS control, such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that was done in China's wildlife market to prevent.
To stop the recurrence of MERS, a comprehensive method for developing effective vaccines against MERS-CoV should be adopted in combination with other infection control systems.
We may see the prevalence of new genotypes as we are unable to eliminate these viruses.
Many species of animal CoVs are spread in nature.
Specifically, the bat CoV-sample, including animal potential, is very unique.
These Junotic CoVs are likely to expand and re-connect, resulting in the origin of new CoVs that will be more infectious and / or fatal among humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary communication between humans and animals.
With the fire tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a better preparation and response plan.
Many viruses have lived on Earth for a long time.
They remain in their own natural habits until they have the opportunity to spread.
Although cattle have many properties that support the spread of viruses, however, the possibility of contact with cattle and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are aware to stay away from them.
In order to better understand the ecological resource of the CoV and their natural refugees, there is a need to be continuous monitoring of mammals, which will prove effective in preventing human infections from animals and future infections.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent animal disease in humans is to stay away from the environmental curvature of the natural spectrum of animal viruses.
Several pieces of the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First of all, if the worms infect the parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 in the forest, it is necessary to see in what circumstances the worms and the forest can share the same environmental worms.
Secondly, if pimples play a more direct role in human infection, it should be determined how people get into contact with pimples.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate pet, it must clarify how it interact with different species, including humans, puppets and pinguins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be done.
If it is a puppy, pinguin or any other breastfeeding, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical population viruses will be identified in its natural habitats in the future.
Continuous research in this case will explain the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
However, it is necessary to update COVID-19’s “thinking as infected” and “sicure infected” diagnosis measurements.
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance for the detection and treatment of Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infection and this guidance provided us with experience and created good references for fighting this epidemic worldwide.
However, Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19 ) is a new disease, based on on ongoing research research and the experience of clinical practices, our awareness and knowledge are also gradually growing; thus, the diagnosis and therapeutic strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and, in accordance with the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines on COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, we provided a completely new diagnosing framework of "such cases" and "such cases".
In December 2019, the 2019 Nevel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV) spread, which was officially named Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named CIVIA ACUT RESPIRATORY CORona Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO identified COVID-19 as an outbreak.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has created a quick advice guide and it was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
Since its publication, it has received a huge response.
Remember, COVID-19 is a new disease, based on on ongoing research research and the experience of clinical practices, and our awareness and knowledge are also gradually growing; thus, the diagnosis and therapeutic strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Medical Guidelines for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), issued by the People's Republic of China National Health Committee, between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven versions, each of which has made significant changes to some content.
Now Zhu and his colleagues commented on our guidelines, they proposed a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidelines and also created valuable references for this epidemic worldwide.
We approve their significant work and thank us.
Of course, their work must also be updated according to the latest diagnosis and medical guidelines of COVID-19 (Trial Seventh Edition) and the latest research.
According to the seventh version (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case, a detailed analysis must have two clinical symptoms with one of the epidemiological historical characteristics, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, three clinical symptoms must be filled in that case.
Epidemiological history: (1) history of residents or travels to the Uhan City and its surrounding areas, or other communities where the symptoms have been in the last 14 days before publication; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (positive to the Nucleic Acid Test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the Uhan City or its surrounding areas, or other communities where the symptoms have been in the last 14 days before publication; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (positive to the Nucleic Acid Test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the Uhan City or its surrounding areas, or other communities where the symptoms have been in the last 14 days before publication;
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with image characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cells in the early stages of climbing show normal, decreased or decreased lymphosite count.
For confirmed case diagnosis based on suspicious cases, any of the following pathogenic or serological evidence should be: (1) the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is positive in the real-time PCR test; (2) a high homogenity or match with the Nevel Corona virus known in the full gen sequencing of the virus; (3) the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies are positive in the serum test; or the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies are positive in the net to the net to the net to the net to the net to the net to the net to the net to the net to the net to the net to the net to the net to the net to the net.
We found that the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020) versions included real-time PCR tests and blood samples with a nucleic acid diagnose in the respiratory tract.
The pathogenic detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh.
Based on the continued work of the researchers, these changes include blood samples for the search for a favorable nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, which increases the smoothness of different samples and helps to get to the criteria to ensure specific antibodies positive results.
Furthermore, more evidence has been found, which reminds us to be warning about irregular symptoms and unsymptomatic patients.
So Zhu and his partners should update the flow list, because they have classified people without clinical symptoms as “low-risk”.
The score system must also be verified in the subsequent clinical practices and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will come and readers will call for their comments.
To diagnose “thinking as infected” and “sicure infected”, we advise to identify them and follow the most recent instructions in our country.
Our team will update our guidelines in time to help.
Bangladesh has five new deaths due to the highest daily COVID-19.
Last week, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to the COVID-19.
This is the number of deaths caused by the virus in one day.
On Wednesday, the Bangladesh Institute of Pathology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) that 114 of the registered infected people were active infected and treated with 33 infected people who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, said four men and one woman were killed.
According to Dr. Mirzadi, two of the infected are over the age of 60, two between the ages of 51 and 60 and one between the ages of 41-50.
He added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 on March 11.
A local news agency, an official of the hospital told the Anadolu Agency that one of the victims was Jalal Sifur Rahman, a director of the Bangla Anti-Corruption Commission, who was served at the Kuwait Alliance Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh Road Transport and Bridge Minister Obadul Kader said that public transport will be closed for longer than planned until next Saturday.
This public transport closure began on March 26th and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential goods such as medical, fuel and food was still permitted.
On March 8, the first incident of COVID-19 infection was recorded between two people returned to Italy and one of their wives.
Until March 19th, these three people have been healed.
Worldwide SARS-CoV-2 infected people have exceeded one million
According to John Hopkins University, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections has exceeded one million worldwide.
At least 52,000 deaths were associated with the disease caused by coronavirus, COVID-19.
The important event occurred on the same day that Malawi confirmed their first coronavirus infection and the first coronavirus-related death occurred in Zimbabwe.
Up to Thursday, North Korea claimed that it was one of the few remaining countries free from coronavirus infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) on April 4th at 10 a.m. in Central European Time (0800 UTC) recorded a confirmed infection of 1,051,635 people, including 79,332 in the previous twenty hours.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection were recorded linking at least 5,900 deaths.
Citating data from John Hopkins University, CBS News that more than 1,000 people in the U.S. died on Wednesday due to coronavirus infection.
Worldwide, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of this disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor Sergey Sobain extended the city's lockdown to May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin has announced that the funding will beined if the Russians do not work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted in favour of raising the state of emergency for 15 days; 215 votes were passed in favour, ten votes were not given and one against.
Saudi Arabia’s sacred cities, Mecca and Medina, have increased carfoe throughout the day; the previous carfoe was only effective from 3:00 to 6:00.
Thailand planned to implement carfu between 10 and 4 in the morning.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has announced that the state has extended its residence order until May 1.
Australian shops reduce the limits of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian store chain has reduced the limitation of purchasing toilet paper per transaction in all stores at the national level in Olwarts and Cols to two and one packages respectively.
Also, ALDI launches the limit of one-pack on Monday.
These restrictions were posted as messages on check-outs and chain Facebook pages.
People thought that if they had to separate themselves, buyers were scared of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also made a package for each order by limiting the sale of toilet paper for home delivery.
These changes followed the limitation of the four packages behind the previous transactions that Woolworth and Cols launched on 4th and 5th March respectively.
"8th March Cols announced in the media that the four-pack prohibition has been introduced in various places, but "many stores are still selling everything within an hour of supply," they called this demand "unprecedented" and in a Facebook post on ALDI on Tuesday they called it "unprecedented".
According to a spokesman for Woolworth, sales have grown sharply last week.
The Costaco store in Canberra was also allowed for two packages last week.
To further reduce the deficit, Cols (Coles) orders larger packages from suppliers and increases the return rate of supply, Woolworths (Woolworths) orders extra stock, where ALDI makes stock available in advance for a planned special Wednesday.
Australian Retailers Association executive director Russell Jimmerman said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local council sanctions during the time of distribution by trucks make it difficult.
As soon as suppliers try to meet demand, he expects the cost of production to increase.
ALDI announced on Tuesday that after previously leaving the stock, some stores could not run special sales on Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the Queensland University of Technology, says that stores fill their own stocks every night.
He commented that toilet paper is a heavy material that results in its collection in a very small number and when all is sold, the enormous enormous rubber leaves empty and strengthens the feeling of lack.
According to ABC News, "Coles and Woolworths' opinion is that if he has a lot of things, and things like toilet rolls and sanitaries, and they have enough, then this fear will probably be reduced," Russell Zimmerman said.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, Hu Gives A. Crap, said Wednesday that their stock will end.
According to News.com.au’s report, Kimberly-Clark, i.e. those who manufacture clinex toilet tissues and solar papers that make the supply, have emphasized that they are continuing to work 24/7 to maintain the supply.
A real estate site Domain.com that some real estate sellers are giving the first bider a free toilet paper at an auction in Melbourne, some of which were due to the auction that buyers had a long weekend vacation.
In this Thursday publication of NT News, each printed in Darwin, an eight-page is added to cut pieces and it is used as a toilet paper.
A report received from 3 March ABC Australia said that stores were basically willing to impose restrictions, where they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on their purchases.
Russell Zimmerman also said that the demand for other products is too high, including masks, sanitaries, dry products, handwashes and rubber.
Similarly, the sale of paper used for the Andres toilet at the UK online supermarket Okado on Sunday evening outside Australia is limited to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as an outbreak.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the current prevalence of COVID-19—the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2—is over-the-counter.
"While the word "extreme" does not mean how dangerous certain cases are, but how widespread any disease has spread, the World Health Organization has noted the need for governments to take action:"
"Every country can still change the path to this global epidemic."
“WHO Secretary-General Adam Hebrews said if states can identify,” he said, “they can test, treat, separate, identify and connect.”
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of disease spread and intensity and the alarming level of inactivity."
According to Dr. Tom Freuden, the former director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the worldwide epidemic is "unprecedented".
"In a comment on CNN in February, he said, "A period of continuous spread from the emergence of any other respiratory virus, except for the flu, has not been traced.""
"Gebras also holds the same opinion, saying, 'We have never seen an epidemic created through a coronavirus before.'"
“He continued to say, ‘And we have never seen a worldwide epidemic that can be controlled at the same time.’”
The new status as a worldwide epidemic followed the decision of the WHO to declare the epidemic as an emergency for international concerns in January.
"Dr. Anthony Fausi, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, said about this infection, "Well, the situation is going to get worse.""
The Associated Press on Thursday that the number of worldwide COVID-19 infections was at least 126,000, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
This 2019-20 corona virus is an epidemic of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is caused by the CIVIA ACUT RESPIRATORY SYNDROME of corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Uhan, China in December 2019, which was declared as an emergency for international concerns on January 30, 2020 and was recognized as a worldwide epidemic on March 11, 2020.
By April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were detected in 210 countries and centralized regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people received healing.
The mortality rate in China Case is estimated at 4% while the worldwide range of this rate ranges from 13.04% to .08% in Algeria.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing.
Complications may include neumonia and acute receptor disorder syndrome.
The time from contact to the beginning of symptoms is usually five days, but it can be from two to four days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and helpful therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your own mouth during cough, keeping a distance from other people, and monitoring and keeping yourself separate for all people who suspect that they have been infected.
Worldwide authorities have reacted by stopping travel controls, quarantines, carfoe, risk controls at workplace and fertility.
The global epidemic resulted in a severe global economic and social disruption, the sports, religious, political and cultural events were cancelled, and the lack of supply increased due to the fear of shopping.
Schools and universities are closed nationally and not locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the total student population in the world.
False information about the virus has spread online, and it has occurred alienation and discrimination against other people from China, Eastern and Southeast Asia and areas where the viral events have been found, depending on their descent and appearance.
Due to the cessation of travel and heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
China's Uhan (Hubei province's capital) health authorities a cluster of infection from unknown causes on 31 December 2019, and an investigation began in early January 2020.
The majority of cases were linked to the Holsel market for Huanese marine food and therefore the virus is believed to have an animal source.
The virus that caused the occurrence was known as SARS-CoV-2, it is a newly discovered virus closely linked to the corona virus, the corona virus and the SARS-CoV. The first person who had the symptoms was known, later on 1 December 2019 it was known that he had been sick; and later that person had no visible connection with the Weight Market Cluster.
In December 2019, two-thirds of the initial clusters of infection were found linked to the market.
A non-approved report by the South China Morning Post on March 13, 2020 indicated that a source found case on November 17, 2019 was the first, which occurred among a 55-year-old man from the Hubei province. on February 26, 2020 the WHO that new infections in China had so-called decreased, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new events outside of China for the first time reflected the number of new events inside China.
The number of infections may be reduced, especially in people with mild symptoms.
Relatively low cases were among young people until February 26, most of them under the age of 19 and 2.4% of cases worldwide. United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser Patrick Valencia has estimated that 60% of the British population needs to be infected before the disease resistance capacity is acquired.
According to the official protocol, case means the number of people whose COVID-19 test and whose test results were positive.
Until March 23, no country tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries like Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have formally established a policy not to test people with light signs.
A study published on March 16 found that around 86% of COVID-19 infections were not identified in China until January 23 and that this unregistered infection was the source of 79% of recorded incidents.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of infections in government accounts.
The initial estimate of the general reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 was from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that it was likely 5.7.
The majority of people infected with COVID-19 are healed.
In those who do not, the interval of death from the increase of symptoms is 6 to 41 days, of which the most common interval is 14 days.
About 97,000 deaths were to be related to COVID-19.
As of February 5, 80% of people who were over the age of 60 died in China and 75% of them had several diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. Official statistics of people who died in COVID-19 generally indicate those who were infected with COVID according to traditional rules.
The number of deaths as a result of COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those people who died without tests - such as homes, nursing homes, etc.
Some partial data from Italy found that the number of over-the-counter deaths increased by 4-5 times the rate of official COVID deaths.
"A promoter of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the number of deaths] is less than the real number" that the statement was reflected by a report that is not less computing based on information in the United States.
The first death outside the main territory of China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines and the first death outside Asia occurred on February 14 in France.
By February 28th, more than a dozen deaths were seen outside China’s main territory in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, with the exception of Antarctica, more than 40 countries and territories on all continents of the world have been deaths.
These numbers vary according to the region, and the amount of tests, the quality of the healthcare system, the treatment options, the period of interruption after the initial infection, and the characteristics of the population, such as age, gender and general health. The ratio of death and infection shows the number of deaths within a given time limit is divided by the number of cases diagnosed.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the worldwide death and case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) until April 10, 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, the number of deaths and case ratio has risen from 17.3% (which has been observed between 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (which has been observed the first symptoms since 1 February 2020). Other preventive measures include the case death rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who died from a disease and the infection death rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of people who died from a disease (diagnosed or undiagnosed) infected.
These statistics are not limited at any time and follow a specific population from infection through case analysis.
Many educated persons have tried to count these numbers for a specific population.
The evidence-based medical center at the Oxford University Center estimates that the mortality rate for this infection is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The calculation of the top of this scale is consistent with a statistical study of COVID-19's first elopathic test in Germany and the analysis of the impact of the test on CFR assumptions.
The WHO has claimed that this excess could be controlled.
The maximum limit and final time limit of the procrastination are uncertain and may vary depending on the location.
"Pen State University's Mackey Boni said, "When it goes out of the test, infectious epidemics usually dominate and then when the disease is no longer a host, it begins to break down."
But it is almost impossible to think about when it will happen at this moment.
“China’s senior medical adviser Zhang Nanshan argued that if all countries could be united to follow the World Health Organization’s advice on preventing the spread of the virus, “this could end in June.”
"On March 17, Adam Kuthersky from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "probably will continue to spread for one or two years.""
"According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other steps must beined until "no vaccine is available (probably 18 months or more)""
"William Shephner from the University of Vanderbilt said, "I think it's quite impossible that this coronavirus - since it's infected so quickly - will completely disappear" and it's "can become a epidemic disease, returning every year."
The intensity of return will depend on the animal's disease resilience and the person's output.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be symptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
It falls among relatively less common symptoms – hearing, breathing pot production (cafe), smell loss, breathing deficiency, muscle and instable connectivity pain, throat swelling, headache, body coldness, swelling, coffee pot coming, excess, or cyanosis. WHO has stated that one in six people are seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists breathing, endless chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, awakening and blue appearance or swelling these as emergency signs; if these signs are present, it is advised to seek immediate medical assistance. further development of this disease can be the cause of severe neumonia, acute receptor disorder syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of those infected may be asymptomatic without any clinical symptoms, but the results of the tests confirm the infection, so the researchers have issued advice to monitor and test from people who are in contact with the infected people to avoid the infection.
The Chinese estimate of the unmarked ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The range of the general incubation stage (in which period the infection and symptoms begin) is from one day to 14 days; the incubation period is five days. In the example of uncertainty, the percentage of people with COVID-19 who initially received the smell was accounted for 30% and the percentage of people who later received the smell was accounted for 15%.
Some details about how this disease spreads are still determined.
It is believed that the disease is mainly spread during close contact and by small droplets produced during cough, swelling or speech; close contact means being between 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that from an open cough the waterfront can rise from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some believe that the virus can also be infected by a small amount of fluid that can be formed when speaking, which lasts in the air for a long time. Respiratory roses can also be formed when breathing, even when speaking, although this virus is usually not ventilated.
Aquariums can enter the mouth or nose of those who are near, or they can enter the lungs through breathing.
Some therapeutic methods, such as induction and cardiopulmonary resitation (CPR), may result in the discharge of the respiratory system in aerosols and, as a result, may spread into ventilation.
It can spread even when someone touches any polluted surface including the skin and then touches their eyes, nose or face.
Although this concern may spread through the mol, this risk is considered to be lower.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oral infection from the SARS-CoV-2 mol. The virus is the most infectious in the first three days of the symptoms occurring, although the symptoms of this disease can become infectious before and after the symptoms occurring.
Many people saw positive results three days before these symptoms began, which suggested that the disease could be infected before any significant symptoms were observed.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed non-signal cases, but some countries have detected non-signal infections during the investigation of contact searches.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that it is not completely clear how the disease spreads easily, but a person usually infects two to three people.
Specifically, this virus is found in plastics (polypropyline), 304 stainless steel, one day on the cardboard and for four hours.
It varies depending on moisture and temperature. pets and other animals have been positively tested for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can spread the virus among humans, although British authorities recommend handwashing after contact with animals, just as infected people touch after touching other surfaces.
Seriously intense respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novellus, which is first separated from three people affected by neumonia associated with the group affected by severe respiratory disorders.
All characteristics of Novel SARS-CoV-2 can be seen in all related corona viruses obtained in nature. This virus is killed by home soap outside of the human body because it breaks the defensive opening of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the real SARS-CoV.
It is believed that it has a source of animal disease.
Genetic analysis has shown that the corona virus is genetically combined with the genus beta-coronavirus and the subgenus surbechovirus (linea B) with the stren found from two bacteria.
In other coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) the full genome level is 96% immediate one.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found in a study that there was only a difference in an amino acid in certain parts of the genome sequence between the viruses in the bronchial and the viruses in the human body.
Until now, compared to the whole genome, it has been found that 92% of the genetic ingredients are similar to the SARS-CoV-2 when it is too high, which is insufficient to prove that the genome served as a host in the middle.
Temporary infection can be diagnosed by the virus depending on the symptoms, but ultimately confirmed by the infected larger's reverse transmission polymerage chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or city image.
A comparative study of PCR with Uhan CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, but less accurate than PCR, and many of its characteristics of photography coincide with other neumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a first-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has published a number of RNA tests for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be done on breath or blood samples.
The results are usually found within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is carried out on a nasopharyngeal swab, but a throat swab can also be used. Some laboratories and companies are preparing serological tests that detect antibodies.
By April 6, 2020, it was not shown to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for long-term use.
Serological tests built by Chelex in the U.S. have been approved to allow only approved applications to be used in emergency conditions.
Characteristic characteristics of photographing in radiography and computer tomography (CT) of the affected people include incomprehensible peripheral ground glass insecurity and the absence of plural affusion.
The Italian Radio Society is collecting an international online database of images obtained from the tests of confirmed cases.
For mixing with other infections such as adenovirus, it is limited to forming any images without any confirmation by PCR and identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared PCR to breast CT results and explained that although the imaging of this infection is now less specific, it’s faster and more sensitive that suggests to consider it as a screening device in epidemic affected areas.
Artificial intelligence convergence is a birth organ that prepares the viral characteristics through radiography and CT.
Strategies for preventing the spread of the disease includeining general personal good health, washing hands, not touching the eyes, nose or face with no washing hands, and throwing or coughing in the tissue and throwing that tissue in a waste container.
Those who may already have an infection are advised to wear a surgical mask in the public.
Physical distance protection measures are also recommended to prevent infection. Many governments have advised or controlled against any unnecessary transportation from countries and regions affected by the infection.
However, the virus has reached a level of spread throughout the world.
This means that the virus is spreading across the public and some people in the public don’t know where or how they were infected. Proof warning, contact warning and eye protection are recommended by healthcare providers who may be infected. Determining the source of an infection and finding people who come to contact to prevent more infections is very important for health authorities.
The administration's use of mobile phone location information for this purpose has raised confidentiality concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations have issued a statement calling for restriction of such surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and by April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts are working on a privacy-friendly solution, such as the use of Bluetooth to log in to the mobile phones of others close to any user.
Then users will receive a message if they get in touch with a COVID-19 positive person. There are several misconceptions about how to prevent this infection. for example – washing in the nose and swallowing with mouth washing is not effective.
COVID-19 has no vaccine, although many companies are still working to create one.
Hand washing was advised to prevent the disease from spreading.
CDC recommends that people sometimes wash their hands with soap and water for at least a few seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands appear to be dirty; before meals; before the nose clots, when toothpaste, or when toothpaste.
Because the virus is killed by home soap outside the human body, which breaks out the virus’s protective bubble.
The CDC recommends that when soap and water cannot be found at hand, at least 60% alcoholic sanitary can be used instead.
The WHO has advised people not to touch their eyes, nose or face with unclean hands.
The surfaces can be polluted with the help of a few injections (within one minute of contact with the surfaces of stainless steel), which includes 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopophanol, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-75% poedone-iodine.
Other solutions such as benchalkonium chloride and chlohexidine gluconate are relatively less effective.
CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed anywhere, such as the office or day care, the office, bathroom, common places, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touchscreen, keyboards, remote control and ATM machines used by sick people should be revived.
Health organizations advise people to throw their face and nose nails or cover the tissue with paper and with it throw the tissue correctly.
Those who are afraid of being infected are advised to wear surgical masks. Wearing a mask can control the amount of emissions and the limit of spread when talking, the time of coughing or the time of coughing.
The WHO has issued a guideline on when and how to wear the mask.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Masks can reduce the tendency to touch the face of people, which is a major source of infection without proper cleansing of their hands."" The use of masks is also recommended for those who are taking care of people who may be affected by this disease."
WHO has advised healthy people to wear a mask only when they are at high risk, such as those who are treating a person infected with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their own face.
Some countries have begun to encourage the public to use face masks.
In the United States, the CDC advises to wear non-medical face mask made from clothes. China specifically advises to healthy members of the population to use decisive medical mask, especially when coming close to other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has advised to wear a surgical mask while traveling in public transportation or while staying in crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand are encouraging people to make face masks at home and wash their roses.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is prohibited not to wear or cover the nose and mouth during the exit.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face mask when they went to the crowd to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has issued an order that one face mask should be worn when entering every mudy store.
Israel asked all its inhabitants to wear a mask on their face whenever they went out.
Taiwan, which has produced about ten million masks a day since mid-March, needs to wear masks on the face of passengers on trains and interstate buses to travel on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask whenever it goes out, and it is recommended for those who cannot buy a face mask to wear a home-made face mask.
In Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore, face masks are also widely used.
Social distance maintenance (also known as physical distance maintenance) includes controlling the spread of infection by reducing the level of disease spread by reducing close communication between individuals.
Methods include: being quarantine; restricting travel; closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or stores.
Individuals can apply methods of setting social distance from home, limiting travel, avoiding populated areas, saying greetings without touching and physically keeping a distance from each other.
Many governments are now obligating or advising to maintain social distances in areas affected by the prevalence of the disease.
According to the recommendation of the U.S. government authorities and health institutions, the maximum size of reunification runs from 250 people (if it is not known that COVID-19 has spread in the area) to 50 people and then 10 people.
"On March 22, 2020, Germany banned more than two people from gathering publicly. elderly people and people with intrinsic medical diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and damaged disease resistance have an increased risk of severe diseases and complications, and CDC has advised them to stay at home as much as possible in socially prevalent areas by the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations have been aimed at "make up" or "make up" to "make up" to "make up" to "make up" to "make up" to "make up" to "make up" to "make up" to "make up" to "make up" to "make up".
"The use of the word "social distance" (social distance) has influenced the way that it has led to complete social isolation instead of encouraging people to maintain communication with others in an alternative way.
It included only advice to have sex with someone who lives with you, who has no virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
Home isolation is recommended for those infected with COVID-19 and those who suspect themselves that they have been infected.
Health agencies issue detailed guidelines for appropriate self-isolation. Many governments make or advise self-quarantine for all inhabitants living in damaged areas.
The most strict instructions for self-quarantine are issued for high-risk groups.
People who get in touch with a person infected with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with a large infection are advised to stay in quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible contact.
The methods of any prevalence control are the shrinking or repression and discharge.
Repression is organized in the early stages of infection, and in addition to finding and separating infected people to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population, it also aims to launch and spread other mechanisms of infection control.
When it is no longer possible to maintain the spread of this disease, efforts go to the level of relief: some remedies are taken to reduce the speed of this spread and reduce its impact on the healthcare system and society.
At the same time, both content and mitigation (Nirson) may need to adopt a mixed standard.
In the case of repression, more excessive measures should be taken so that the number of initial reproductions is less than 1 and the ecstasy cycle can be overturned. The maximum limit of epidemic is part of the fight against the prevalence of a infectious disease, which is known as the equalization of the epidemic line.
It appears to reduce the risk of healthcare and gives more time for the treatment and the treatment that can be better.
Other ways other than medication can be controlled include personal preventive measures, such as the health of hand cleansing, the wear of face masks, and self-quarantine; public measures aimed at keeping physical distance, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of public meetings; recognizing and engaging the public in such other ways; also environmental measures, such as the cleansing of the surface.
Other countries have also adopted several standards to limit the direction of the spread of this virus.

Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and increased the sanctions for fraud in medical supplies.The vans of the efforts of the United Kingdom and the United States prove that relief (which has been disrupted but the spread of the epidemic has not been prevented) and repression (increased in response to the epidemic) are a major challenge.
Although the policy of maximum discharge could reduce the highest demand for healthcare by 2/3 and death by half, the health systems are still breaking as a result of millions of deaths.
Repression may be a preferred way, but it is necessary to maintain it as long as the virus will continue to be transmitted among the human population (or until a drug is available, if it comes first), since if the measures are relieved, otherwise the virus infection will return quickly.

Turkey has also launched several hundred specific vents for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticized them for the lack of European Union solidarity with the influential Italy in Coronavirus.
Italian Ambassador to the European Union Mauricio Masari said that “only China has responded bilaterally.”
“It’s not a good sign for European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Kant, the Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military medicine, special rescue cars and other medical equipment to Italy.
"An unknown "high-level political source" in the Italian newspaper La Stampa stated that 80 percent of Russian support was "inadequate or slightly usable for Italy."
“The source accused Russia of launching a mission to ‘geographically-politically and diplomatically’ satisfy.”
Lombardy President Atilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi de Mayo rejected the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical equipment to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, "When the context of helping U.S. colleagues comes, [Putin] has thought that when U.S. medical equipment manufacturers get a bit of speed, they will also be able to reward."
"NATO's "Defender 2020" military habits, which are planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, will be organized at a reduced level, which is NATO's largest battle force since the end of the Cold War."
“Kate Hudson, the Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticized the 2020 (Defender 2020) exercise: “In the current public health crisis, it will not only threaten the lives of the forces of the United States and many other participating European countries, but also threaten the lives of the inhabitants of the countries where they control.”
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to the world's leaders on March 14, 2020 in which he said that the U.S. has less access to the international market due to the imposition of sanctions against Iran, making it harder for them to fight against this epidemic. This epidemic has led to the U.S. calls for universal health services, universal child care, paid family holidays and high-level public health funding institutions.
Political analysts predicted that this could negatively affect the possibility of Donald Trump’s re-election in the 2020 presidential election during a global epidemic that deteriorated diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
“After announcing that any people from South Korea will be kept in quarantine in Japan for two weeks, South Korea has criticized Japan’s ‘unclear and inactive quarantine efforts’.”
South Korean society was at two opposite stages in the reaction of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis at the beginning.

In Hungary, its parliament gives Prime Minister Viktor Orban the right to rule for an indefinite period, to submit parliament or to conduct the election process and to punish those respected people who are propagating a number of misinformations about how the disease is infected and how the government is dealing with the crisis.
The coronavirus is responsible for the lack of supply, the increased worldwide use of the necessary materials to fight the epidemic, the creation of fear and the disruption of the work of the factory and logistics.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the lack of medications and medical equipment due to the increased demand of buyers and the disturbance of suppliers.
In many areas, shopping was also seen due to fear, which led more people to buying food, toilet paper, and bottled water, which led to a shortage in Gagan.
In particular, the technology industry has warned of delay in the delivery of electrical products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adam, the demand for personal safety equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand increased the price twenty times the normal price and resulted in a six-month delay from the supply of medical materials.
It created a lack of personal protective equipment worldwide, and the WHO warned that it would put health workers in danger.
In Australia, this over-the-counter Diego offers sellers a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
The activity resulted in insufficiency of baby formulas in some supermarkets and later the Australian government prohibited. Despite the majority of COVID-19 cases spread in northern Italy and the Uhan region, ensuring the excessive demand for food, both areas have tried to keep themselves free from severe food deficiency.
China and Italy’s measures against the storage of essential goods and illegal trade have succeeded, which have been able to avoid the intense food deficiency that was predicted in North America as well as in Europe.
Although no significant decline in agricultural products in northern Italy is seen, industry representatives say prices may rise.
When Chinese government officials abandoned pork meat stored in order to provide enough nutrition to the people, even in the city of Uhan, they were initially faced with empty food.
There is the same national law in Italy that requires food producers to keep food reserves for this national emergency.
The loss in the world economy has also been felt in China: According to a media report on March 16, due to the government’s steps to reduce the spread of the virus, China’s economy has taken a very strong push in the first two months of 2020 and retail or retail sales have decreased by 20.5%.
Since China's main land plays a key role as the center of economy and production, the viral spread threatens to create a major instability in the world economy.
Agatha Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain changing until a more clear picture of the potential outcome is revealed.
In January 2020, some analysts predicted that the global growth epidemic caused by economic disasters could exceed the prognosis of 2002-2004 SARS.

“After the low demand from China, oil prices have dropped completely, the Petroleum Exporting Countries Organization (OPEC) said it was “crowded on the knees.”
On 24th February, the global stock market fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 outside of China.
In February 27, due to increasing concerns about the prevalence of coronavirus, several U.S. stock shifts, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, posted their most sharp falls since 2008, including the Dow dropped 1,191 points, the biggest one-day fall since the financial crisis of 2007-08.
The three indicators were above 10% at the end of the week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, butined a negative outlook.
The coronavirus threatens the stock market to decline again.The biggest decline was observed on March 16.
Many consider the possibility of an economic crisis.
The economist Mohammed El-Arian has praised the central bank and the state’s timely emergency system.
Central banks are facing faster than they had faced in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism prohibition, attractive tourist sites including all populated places and all kinds of travel around the world is one of the most damaged departments for government prohibition of tourism.
As a result, several airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas canceled flights for relatively low demand, as British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The terrible impact that has been seen in the marine travel industry has never been seen before.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
During the Chinese New Year's Holidays, the main season of the trip to China, Chununun, began, when the Chun epidemic began.
Many events where there may be a lot of crowds such as annual New Year's celebrations, etc. have been closed by national and regional governments. Private organizations are also closing their stores and closing various attractive tourist centres such as Hong Kong's Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's celebrations and tourist gathers have been closed, including the city and traditional temples that are banned in Beijing for the prevention of massacre.
Officials in 24 provinces, municipalities and regions of 31 provinces in China have extended New Year's holidays to 10th February and ordered most jobs not to be reopened until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has maximized the level of reaction to its infectious disorder and declared emergency, closed schools until March and canceled the New Year's celebration. The worldwide retail sector has been affected by the decline or temporary closure during the opening of stores.
The visits to stores in Europe and Latin America were reduced by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
As a result, the number of buyers in shopping centers fell 33–43% in March compared to February.
Worldwide shopping mall managers have imposed additional measures, such as improving health care, placing thermal scanners to verify the temperatures of buyers, and canceling events. According to estimates of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the global epidemic crisis that begins in Latin America could cause more than 14 to 22 million people to extreme poverty than the situation would exist without the global epidemic.
About 5 million people in China lost their jobs in the final stage of the Uhan Examination in January and February 2020.
Many of China’s approximately 300 million countryside workers have lost their jobs in domestic areas or have been stuck in the Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus infection could cause 47 million people to lose jobs in the U.S. and the unemployment rate could reach 32%.In India, the lockdown resulted in a few million Indian travel workers (which pay per day/which pay per day) becoming unemployed.A survey by the Angus Red Institute found that 44% of Canadian families suffer from any kind of unemployment.
In the second half of March, 4 million French employees applying for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British employees applying for a universal credit project. Nearly half of the million German companies sent their employees to a government-funded short-term action plan known as Curterbet.
France and Britain also accepted the German short-term work compensation.
The fields of performance arts and cultural traditions have been deeply damaged by this transition, which has resulted in the activity of organizations as well as individuals - both employed and independent - damaged worldwide.
The institutions in the field of art and culture tried to carry out their own ( almost governmentally paid) mission to ensure access to the community’s cultural traditions, to maintain the security of their employees and people, and to cooperate with artists where possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, contexts and other cultural institutions around the world and in various dimensions have been closed unlimited by canceling or delaying their exhibitions, events and performances.
Another recent and rapidly growing consequence of this disease is the rise of religious services, the main events of sports and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the holy week celebrated in Rome in the last week of the cruel season of Christian Lent was cancelled.

The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the flood, and the religious lands were later closed, and Saudi Arabia banned foreign migrants and residents from entering the sacred lands of Mecca and Medina.
This epidemic was the cause of the most important disaster in the world’s sports calendar after World War II.
The majority of the main sports competitions, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season, have been cancelled and not suspended.
"This incidence disrupted the plan for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was essentially expected to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event "whether re-established at any date after 2020 but will not be after the summer of 2021" Worldwide casinos and other playgrounds are closed and the live poker tournaments are suspended or cancelled."
The report of a significant increase in the new subscriptions on gambling sites shows that this has led to a lot of gamblers coming online. to suspend or cancel various music groups' waterboards tours, the entertainment industry has also been damaged.
Many major theaters, such as those on Broadway, have suspended all performances.
“Some artists have continued to create and share the art through the internet as an alternative to everyday live events, such as live streaming of music festivals or creating web-based “festivals” so that artists can perform, distribute and promote their work.”
On the internet, the theme of the coronavirus has spread to the Internet memes that are so ridiculous and also distract the eye from the time of this uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, predictions have been observed against people from China and Eastern Asia, and against people from the hotspots regions of Europe, the United States and other countries, and a growing fear and ethnicity against foreigners.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
The reports of cases found since February contain records that Chinese people around the world have revealed racist attitudes to various groups, where they are claimed to be worthy of the virus or what is being done to them as a fair revenge.
In some African countries, anti-China attitudes have also increased.
Many inhabitants of Uhan and Hubei said they were discriminated depending on regional identity.
There was support for Chinese both online and offline, and there was also support for people in viral-infected regions.
According to the progress of the spread in the new hotspots countries, Italian people, who experience the terrible experience of the COVID-19 spread as the first country in Europe, may be suspicious and foreigners. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed a petition/application to investigate the prohibition of Chinese people entering their country.
In Japan, #ChinaJapanThis hash tag has become very popular.
As well as racist torture against Chinese in the UK and the United States, the levels of attacks are increasing.
“The U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for referring the coronavirus as a ‘Chinese virus’ because critics consider it racist and anti-Chinese.”
Ukrainian protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign passengers from Uhan to Nabi Sanjahar.
North-Eastern India, which shares a border with China, students from there who are studying in India’s major cities have been to be victims of coronavirus-related harassment.
“Indian People’s Party’s West Bengal State Unit’s professor Dalip declared that the Chinese destroyed nature and “this is why God has revenge against them.””
The Chinese Consulate of Kolkata has strongly criticized this comment in Kolkata and he has referred it to as “fake.” Genophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents in China have increased further during this extreme period. Here foreigners have been described as “foreign waste” and identified as “extraction”.
There are some other newspapers, including PayPal, who have removed them from their partial or complete coronavirus coverage.
Many specific publications have created scientific subjects related to the procrastination which are available in open access.

The laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include the methods that detect the presence of the virus and identify the antibiotics produced in the reaction to the infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and intended only to identify the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to ensure very recent or active infections.
Antibodian detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and public surveillance.
Antibodian tests showed how many people the disease occurred, including those people whose symptoms were too rare to report or who were symptomatic.
A correct mortality rate of the disease and the group resistance in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited tests, until March 2020, no country had reliable information about the prevalence of the virus among its population.
By March 23, none of the countries tested more than 3% of their population, and there is a huge gap in the number of tests that have been tested across different countries.
This difference will likely significantly affect the mortality rate in the cases, which is likely to be significantly overwhelmed in some countries.
In addition to nasopharyngeal swab or thutur samples, respiratory samples obtained through different methods can be tested using real-time reverse transcription polymerage chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Usually the results are found within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with a throat swab is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
The virus may later disappear from the throat, but the number in the lungs may continue to increase.
In the case of infected people tested in the second week, otherwise the sample material can be taken from the depths of the respiratory tract by the saxon cathetor, or the emitted object (touch) with cough can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was prepared in January 2020 at Charité, Berlin, using real-time reverse transcription polymerage chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and it formed a base of 250,000 kit for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
South Korean company Kogenebiotech created a clinical stage PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
BGI Group in China was one of the first companies to be approved for the emergency use of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit from the National Medical Products Administration in China. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is one of the first companies to be approved for the emergency use of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit from the National Medical Products Administration in China. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is one of the first companies to be approved for the emergency use of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit from the National Medical Products Administration in China.
One of the three genetic tests of the test kit resulted in unlimited results due to defective reagents and a barrier to the CDC testing in Atlanta; resulting in the average of less than 100 samples successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
The tests using the two materials were not determined to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use approval. U.S. business labs began testing at the beginning of March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the validity of the COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics also presented the national COVID-19 test on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced; samples must be collected and processed according to the requirements of the CDC.
The test of COVID-19 in Russia was prepared and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
The test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare on 11 February 2020. on 12 March 2020, a report was found that the Mayo Clinic prepared a test to detect COVID-19 infection. on 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the approval of the FDA for a test that could be performed in more than 3.5 hours, thus allowing a device to perform about 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted Abbott Laboratories Emergency Use Authorization (USA) for a test on Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA previously granted similar approvals to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020 the same way, Cepheid was received from the FDA for a test, which took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a gradual temperature cycle, this method can give positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 of these devices in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests a day. A test uses a monoclonal antibody, which is specifically linked to the new coronavirus's nucleocapside protein (N protein), and exactly like a fast flu test it can give results within 15 to 20 minutes with this hope this test is being prepared in Taiwan.
"A literary review of March 2020 concluded that "the importance of breast radiography in the early stages is very low in the diagnosis, but the information obtained from CT [computed tomography] may be present before the symptoms begin.""
The characteristics of CT include a long-range, non-range and back-range distribution of bilateral, multi-lobe ground-glass opecity.
With the emergence of the disease, subplural dominance, Crazy Peving and consolidation are observed.
A comparative study of PCR with CT in Uhan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, but less accurate than PCR, and many of its characteristics of photography coincide with other neumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "COVID-19 should not be used as a first-line CT test for the selection test or for the diagnosis" according to March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for the initial selection test."
Part of the disease-resistant response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
From 7 days after the beginning of symptoms to identify infection in humans, to determine disease resistance and to use them in public monitoring. Evaluations can be carried out by point-of-care testing (poCT) in the central laboratory (central laboratories, CLT).
High-performance automatic systems in many essential labs will be able to perform in this axis, but their efficiency will depend on the production rate for each system.
A single sample of endocrine blood for CLT is commonly used, although gradual samples can also be used to follow pathogenic reactions.
Usually a single sample of blood is taken by scratching on the skin for PoCT.
In March 26, 2020, the FDA announced the names of 29 organizations that provided notifications to the agency according to the need and now they are able to distribute their antibiotic tests therefore.
By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test sets that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The test capacity is a few hundred samples in a few hours, and therefore it is much faster than the absolute PCR assessment of the viral RNA.
At the beginning of April, the UK learned that any antibiotic test kit they bought was not good enough for the use.
"Hong Kong has created a hospital where suspicious patients can stay at home, ""The emergency department will give the patient a sample tube"", he will swallow it, send it back and get the test results a little later.The British NHS has announced that they are launching a hospital on a experimental basis to test suspicious events at home, which eliminates the risk of infection by other people by the patient when he goes to a hospital, or requires the release of it when the ambulance is used.
Driving-three centers have helped South Korea make the fastest, most comprehensive testing in any country. The National Association of Statistical Health Insurance Physicists in Germany said on March 2 that they have the capacity to test about 12,000 per day in their traveling settings and 10,700 people were tested in the previous week.
When the test is on the orders of a doctor, health bima carries the costs.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the overall capacity to test 160,000 tests a week.
On March 19, Driving in tests were given in many major cities.
The total number of tests carried out in Germany on March 26, 2020 was unknown, as only positive events were.
"A first laboratory study revealed that at least a total of 483,295 samples were tested until the 12/2020 calendar week and included, and the test found 33,491 samples (6.9%) positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Israel. The researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and tested a method by combining samples to test samples from 64 patients together, and the combined samples were found positive only in that case.
The construction work was supervised by B.G.I. founder Wang Zian and the modeling resulted in the fact that if the test capacity did not increase in the right time, the incidents in the Hubei case would increase by 47% and the cost of carantine handling would double.
In a total of 12 cities across China, such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, Huo-Yan labs quickly followed the Wuhan Laboratory.
From the open source published by Origami Assays, multiple (multiplexed) designs have been published that can test a maximum of 1122 patients for COVID19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be carried out in small laboratories without the need for a robotic liquid manager.
In March, the lack of agent and insufficient amounts became a limit in the field of mass testing in the European Union and the UK and the United States.
Because of this, some researchers explored the sample preparation protocol where the samples were heated for 5 minutes at 98 °C (208 °F) to release RNA genoms for the next test. On March 31 it was announced that the United Arab Emirates is now testing more people for the coron virus than other countries and is on the way to increase the test level to reach the majority of the population.
"This was done through the drive-threatening capacity and the collection of laboratory purchases of a population-scale production from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China)."
The laboratory built in 14 days was able to perform tens of thousands of times more RT-PCR tests a day and the first laboratory in the world to perform outside China.
In China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S. various tests were developed targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus.
All low-income countries that do not have the resources to create their own kit are sent to the German source of production of the kit adopted by the World Health Organization.
The German Journal was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol prepared by the United States Centers for Disease Control (United States Centers for Disease Control) was not available until January 28, which delayed the tests available in the US. The reliability of the test kit at the beginning of the disease occurred between China and the United States, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kit for recommendations to meet the demand and to be tested by health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that over-testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the corona virus.
For several years, the South Korean administration has developed the capacity to test primarily in private field labs.
On 16th March, the World Health Organization COVID-19 called for an increase in the experimental program as the best way to slow down the progression of the transition. The increased demand for tests due to the widespread viral infection led to the creation of millions of experimental work in private U.S. labs, and the supply of swab and chemical bacteria was under pressure.
In March 2020, China announced a problem in the accuracy of its test kit.
"The test kit prepared by the CDC in the United States had a "defect"; then the administration removed the democratic barriers that prevented private tests. Spain bought the test kit from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but saw that the results were wrong."
The company explained that the wrong results may result in the failure to collect samples or correctly use the kit.
The Spanish ministry said they would withdraw the wrong-resulted kit, and replace them with a different kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The Czech Republic gave 80% of the wrong-results of the test kit purchased from China. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kit from China which were found correct.
The Turkish Ministry of Health, Ates Kara, said that the Turkish test kit purchased from China had "high rate errors" and they had "not used them."The UK bought 3.5 million test kit from China but announced at the beginning of April 2020 that they were not usable.
Testing and then quarantining those who found positive results in the test and finding those who were in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive people found positive results.
The first place of death at COVID-19 in Italy, researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, conducted two trials over the total population of 3,400 people in about ten days intervals.
Nearly half of the people who found positive results in the trials had no symptoms and all the people identified were kept in quarantine.
As a result of the control of traffic in the community, the new infection has been completely eliminated.
Attacking people aggressively, through intrinsic travel control, testing and quarantining, but without any extreme control such as forcing the closure of restaurants and retail organizations, Singapore’s 2020 coronavirus worldwide epidemic has progressed much more slowly than other developed countries.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay at home on March 28, but the schools opened again in time after a holiday break on March 23.
Many other countries have also aggressively found people in touch, through intrinsic travel control, testing and quarantining, but controlled the worldwide epidemic with less aggressive lock-down, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that the death rates were much lower in the countries that tested more than the deaths, as these countries were likely to have been able to identify patients with light or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the ability to test and that national labs have limited experience with COVID-19 should be sent to any of the 16 WHO reference labs for the first five positive and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to be tested.
Of the 16 reference laboratories there are 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The column "In the following chart" "How much percent of the tests are positive" is influenced by the country's test policy."
In a country where only people who are hospitalized are tested, the positive percentage of the test will be higher than in a country where everything else is equal, whether the human symptoms are observed or not, all citizens are tested.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand health, means the work of a person's hand cleaning in order to remove soil, grass, molecular organisms or other unwanted substances.
Regular handwashing with soap "in certain "important moments of the day" prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are infected through the path of the mouth and mouth."
People may also be affected by respiratory diseases such as flu or common colds, for example, if they don’t wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose or face (i.e., arthritis).
The five important moments of the day when washing your hands with soap are: before and after swallowing, after cleaning the baby's bottom or after changing the nap, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or giving hands raw meat, fish, or peanut butter.
If water and soap are not found, the hands can be cleaned with a rubber.The World Health Organization recommends handwashing:
Before and after the preparation of food.
Before and after taking care of the sick person.
After changing the diaper or after cleaning the baby who has used the bathroom.
After your nose is swallowed, coughed or swallowed.
After touching animal, animal food, or animal waste.
Healthy hands related medicine refers to healthy habits related to medical methods.
Washing your hands before taking medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to keep hands clean from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may cause harmful or disease.
It is especially important for people who take care of food or work in medical fields, but it is also an important method for ordinary people.
Hand washing has many health-related benefits, including reducing the infection of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And to reduce the rate of child death during delivery at home.
A 2013 study found that improved habits of handwashing could lead to a slight improvement in the length of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, introducing simple behavioral changes such as washing hands with soap can reduce the death rate of children related to respiratory and diarrhized diseases.
This common process can reduce the death rate from this disease by about 50%.
The measures adopted to encourage handwashing can reduce the diary episode by about a third, and it is comparable to the supply of clean water in low-income areas.
The only most effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhea and severe respiratory infections (ARI) is to wash hands with soap as an automatic habit in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Neumonia, which is a major ARI, is the main cause of death among children under the age of five. It takes the lives of approximately 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and neumonia caused the deaths of approximately 3.5 million children per year.
According to UNICEF, changing into a strong habit of washing hands with soap before and after eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, decrease deaths from diarrhea by half, and decrease deaths from severe respiratory infections by one-third.
Handwashing as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs is combined with other sanitation systems.
Hand washing protects against infectious inflammatory diseases (impathygo), which are infected through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to skin drying.
A Danish study of 2012 found that overwhelming hand washing could result in hair loss, skin shrinking, known as hand eczema or hand shrinking, which is common among health care professionals.
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
The five important times of the day when washing your hands with soap are: after the use of the bathroom (urine, urination), after the baby's bottom cleansing or after the shift, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or hand in raw meat, fish, or pottery.
Other times when the disease should be used the right hand washing methods to prevent infection include cutting or wound before and after treatment; cramps, cough, or nose cramps; after touching animal waste or after dragging the animal; and after touching the waste.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is very low.
A 2015 study of handwashing in 54 countries found an average of 38.7% of families used to handwashing with soap. A 2014 study found that 97 percent in Saudi Arabia was the highest rate; the United States was about 77 percent in the middle; and China was the lowest rate of 23 percent. There are now a number of ways to change the habits to increase the habits of handwashing with soap during the crisis.
"The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of taking adequate measures for promoting children's health and education."
The main theme of this national program is to brush your teeth twice a year, and wash your hands with soap every day, and wash your teeth with fluoride every day.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergents to the water increases the elimination of molecular organisms from the skin.
The main task of soap and detergents is to reduce the discharge obstacle and increase the solubility.
Only water ineffective skin cleansers (skin cleansers) because the fat and protein, which are organic soil components, are not easily dissolved in the water.
The cleaning facility is provided with the help of moderate water flow.
Nitrate soap, due to its re-use nature, can retain the bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies aimed at the bacterial transfer from polluted hard soap came to the conclusion that the possibility of transfer was lower because the bacteria was washed with a fener.
"CDC still says that "the liquid soap that can be controlled without the use of the hands is preferable for application.""
A lot of public awareness about antibacterial soap has been promoted.
No evidence of the use of antibiotics or antibiotics recommended for natural antibiotic-resistant organisms has been found until today.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial ingredients such as triclosan, which is capable of overdosing organism resistance.
Thus, although antibiotic resistant strens are not selected for antibacterial soap, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfacing and skin-protecting ingredients, the preparation can also contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), anti-microbially active benzoic acid and extra skin conditioners (alovera, vitamins, mentals, plant extract) as a pH controller. The University of Oregon School of Public Health has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the disease prevention and hand-to-hand bacterial elimination of trocano-related substances, such as the common function of trocano-related substances.
Comfortable hot water for hand washing is not warm enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria grow very quickly at body temperature (37 °C).
But the natural oils that keep the soil and bacteria are more effective than hot soap water, cold soap water to remove.
However, contrary to popular beliefs, scientific studies have shown that the use of hot water has no effect on reducing the microbial weight in the hands.
A hand sanitary or hand antiseptic that is not water-based is a hand cleaning material.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, non-water-based alcohol rubber began to gain popularity in hand cleaning ingredients (alcohol-based rubber, also known as antiseptic hand rubber, or hand sanitary).
To reduce the availability of use and the drying effect of alcohol, is mostly made on the basis of carbon (acrylic acid polymer) or isopropyl alcohol or ethanol prepared together, including density of substances such as fluid metal or glycerin in foam.
Mixed hydrogen-peroxid added further increases the antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitary contains a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol that is capable of killing bacteria.
Alcohol rubber sanitaries kill bacteria, multiple drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), bacteria and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, flu and hepatitis) and sputum.
Alcohol rubber sanitizer contains 70% alcohol that kills 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, equal to 35 decibel reduction) after 30 seconds of application and kills 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) bacteria after 1 minute of application. hand sanitizer is most effective against bacteria and relatively less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitaries are the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis and are almost entirely ineffective against the viruses of the Norovirus (or Norovac) type. The two hands must use sufficient hand antiseptic or alcohol rubber to properly shake or pre-shake.
As long as the liquid, foam or gel is not dry, both hands are swallowed in the front and back and between the fingers and the end end for about 30 seconds.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises to wash your hands well with hand sanitary rubber, especially when you see dirt in your hands.
The increasing use of these ingredients depends on the usability of their use and the rapid absorption of the molecular organism; although if soap and water are not available, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing.
If the formula does not contain emoliants and / or skin masters attached, the frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitary may cause dry skin.
The effect of drying alcohol by adding glycerin and/or other lotions to the formula can be reduced or eliminated.
In medical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitaries with soft ingredients produced significantly less tension and drying on the skin than soap or biodegradant detergents.
Allergic contact inflammatory diseases, contact inflammatory disorders or over-sensitivity to additives present in alcohol or alcohol occur very rarely in the alcohol hand rabbit.
Compared to handwashing with soap and water, the lower tendency to trigger painful touched dermatitis became a cause of attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free ingredients do not clean the organic substances of the hand, but only release the hand.
Since the diseases are still out of hand, many diseases are not so effective in preventing the spread of soap and water.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitary depends more on the ingredients and preparation and has worked significantly less than alcohol and alcohol rubber in past events.
Recently, benchalconium chloride has been shown to maintain stable and proliferative antimicrobial activity after the application of the preparation of the user, which is not like alcohol, which has likely been shown to decrease after repeated use due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
In a low-income society, many people don’t have a combination of money spending for savannah and instead they use soil or soil.
It can be more efficient than water or soil, but it can be less efficient than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or shell is contaminated by molecules, it can increase the spread of the disease instead of decreasing.
Like the soap, it is also a vital ingredient because it creates a purified solution in contact with water.
If soap is not found, the WHO recommends soap as an alternative to soap.
The proper handwashing strategies recommended by the U.S. Disease Control Centers for the prevention of infection include the following steps:
Wash your hands in hot or cold flowing water.
Water is recommended because permanent basin may be contaminated, but the water temperature does not seem to make any difference.
Put the back of your hands, in your fingers and under your nails with sufficient amounts of soap.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin and studies have shown that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of water.
Drink for at least 20 seconds.
The time of scraping (smelling) is a swelling that removes the bacteria from the skin and removes more bacteria when swelling for a long time.
Wash it well in the water.
The hand in the basin may be contaminated again.
Wash it with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
The wet and wet hands are more easily reinfected. the places that are most missing are the spots in the fingers, spots, in the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and fate nails can provide refuge to the polish molecules.
It is often recommended to make the hands not dry; dry skin can damage the skin, which may increase the risk of infection spread.
"In developing countries where the water and / or soap of the tap is not available, a variety of low-cost alternatives for the benefits of handwashing can be created, for example, water swallowing and / or use of the shell from the hanging jericane or suitable hole layer in circumstances of limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving alternatives such as "TP-TAP" and other low-cost alternatives."
Tippi-Tap is a simple technology where a foot-driven liver and a piece of soap are used to wrap a wire and a small amount of water in the hand.
Hand drying is an essential part of the health process, but there is a bit of debate about the most effective way of drying in the universal washroom.
The increasing amount of research indicates that paper towel is much healthier than the electric hand dryer that is seen in many washrooms.
To compare the health levels provided by paper towel, hot-air hand dryer and more modern jet-air hand dryer, paper towel industry was produced by European tissue symposium in 2008 and a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London.
After hand washing and drying with the help of a hot-air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by 194% in the finger and 254% in the arm.
Drying with the help of a jet-air dryer results in an average increase in the total number of bacteria by 42% in the finger and 15% in the arm.
After washing the hands with paper towel after washing, the total bacteria in the finger decreased by an average of up to 76% and up to 77% in the handbone. The result of each type of drying method, the scientists also tested to prove whether there was a possibility of pollution (cross-contamination) spreading from the other washroom users and the space of the washroom environment.
The jet-air dryer, which emits air at ained speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 miles/h), was able to explode the molecules from the hands and units and remove the potential pollution of the washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spreads the molecular organism to a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towel micro-organism has not shown any significant spread. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt (TÜV Produkt und Umwelt) evaluated the methods of drying different hands.
The following changes have been observed in the number of bacteria after hand drying:
There are many different types of hand dryer manufacturers and hand dryer has been compared to drying with paper towel.
The use of hand sanitation pipes due to the lack of soap and water during travel is an alternative to handwashing.
Alcohol-based hand sanitary contains at least 60% of alcohol.
The medical handwashing hospital environment was compulsory many years after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semelway's discovery of the effectiveness of handwashing (1846) in preventing diseases.
There are some electrical devices that give feedback to remind people when they forget to wash their hands.
A study found that the rate of infection was reduced by using them.
Treatment-related hand washing is used for a minimum of 15 seconds and sufficient amounts of soap and water or gel to remove each part of the hand.
The fingers should be bound together and the hands should be bound together.
If there is dirt under the nails, a brisle brush can be used to remove it.
Since the organs can be in the water of the hand, it is important to clean the fence well and dry it with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to stop the water call (and open another door to get out if necessary).
This can prevent the pollution of the hands from the surface.
"The purpose of handwashing in a healthcare environment is to remove the pathogens that cause diseases ("biotics") and prevent their infection."
The New England Journal of Medicine that the lack of handwashing in most medical environments has remained unacceptable, a lot of doctors and nurses regularly forget about handwashing before touching patients, thereby causing molecular infection.
One study found that proper hand-drying and other simple methods could reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infection by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published an ideal hand-drying and hand-drying paper in the Department of Health-related care.
The draft guidelines on hand health by the organization for public comments can also be found on its website.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby and others.
If it is necessary to verify the regulator's sequence, commercial devices can measure and verify the health of the hands.
"The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" for Handwashing:"
After the contact of blood/body fluid
before the work of releasing the disease, and
“After taking care of the patient, the soap provides the ability to destroy the anti-septic chemical additives (“medicate” or “antimicrobial” soap) in the hand washing material.”
It is necessary to have a call to 'scrub' your own hands for the operation work that can be launched and closed without touching with your hands, some clorhexidine or iodine washing system, hand drying after washing is essential to have a brush for handless towels and scraping and other handless equipment for cleaning under your nails.
All the clothes must be opened.
This procedure usually requires 2-6 minutes of washing up to the hands and neck.
It is not necessary to swallow your hands for a long time (10 minutes).
During washing, the water from the hand cloth to the necklace must be prevented from moving back to the hand cloth.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dryed with untouched clothes and a surgical garment is worn.
To reduce the spread of the organ, it is better to wash your hands before and after taking care of the sick person or to use hands antiseptics.
For the control of staphyloccal infections at the hospital, it was found that the most benefits of hand washing were from the first 20% washing and the additional benefits were found very little when the repetition of hand cleaning increased to over 35%.
Washing with ordinary soap with antibacterial soap compared with washing with antibacterial soap resulted in three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases in food. In the middle of 30 seconds, comparing hands-to-hand soap with alcohol-based infusion with antibacterial soap each showed that alcohol-to-hand soap decreased bacterial pollution by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water/water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubber to reduce H1N1 influenza virus and clostridium defisil seeds. To improve the health of hands in healthcare environments, hand washing, alcohol-based hand rubber availability can involve teaching staff and staff's written and oral reminder issues.
More research is needed on which of these improvement works are the most effective in different healthcare environments.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, essential way to healthy, even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies in people’s home, school and workplace, soap or handwashing facilities make a challenge for achieving universal handwashing habits.
For example, although in most regions of rural Africa there are cheap options to create handswashing spaces, there are very few handswashing calls near each private or public toilets.
However, the low rate of handwashing may be due to deep-woven habits instead of the lack of soap or water/water.
The promotion and advice of handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to a long-term change in people’s habits.
It needs to be observed and evaluated to work effectively.
"A regular review of 70 studies showed that community-based methods in LMIC are effective in handwashing, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of the promotion of handwashing in schools is the UNICEF's "Three Star Approach" which encourages schools to take simple, affordable steps to ensure that students are washed with soap among other health needs."
When the minimum value is achieved, the schools can reach three stars from one to the end.
The handwashing station can be a part of the handwashing campaign that is conducted to reduce diseases and child death rates that can be a part of helping.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness awareness campaign that strives to make a change in habits. 2019-20 Coronavirus as a result of an overtime, UNICEF has promoted recognition of handwashing emotions.
DALYs have considered several studies on the overall cost savings of handwashing in developing countries on resistance.
However, a review shows that handwashing with soap is relatively more affordable than other water/water and sanitation systems.
“The importance of handwashing for human health – especially for people who are in unprotected situations, such as hospitalized mothers who have all given birth to children or wounded soldiers – the two pathways of handwashing recognized it in the first 19th century: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semelweiss who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, English “the founder of modern nursing”.”
Until that time, most people believed that the infection was caused by a bad smell called Miyasmas.
In the 1980s, the prevalence of food-related diseases and health-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand health more actively as an important way of preventing the spread of infection.
The prevalence of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 in 2020 have raised awareness of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect themselves from this type of infectious disease in many countries.
"As an example, in Germany, posters with "correct handwashing strategies" were hanged on public toilets and on the side of the handwashing signals of the office buildings and airport toilets."
"This kind of phrase, "throwing the hand of a person" means taking responsibility for the matter or expressing the person's disobedience to be a co-working partner."
It originates from the part of the Bible of Matthew where Pontius Pilate wiped his hands from the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but by the wider use among some English communities it became a spark of a language.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands in an attempt to clear the imaginary spots of madness by revealing her feelings of crime about the crime she committed and encouraged her husband to commit crime.
It has also been found that when people think or think of immoral acts, they tend to wash their hands much more than others, and they tend to pay more price to handwashing equipment.
"In addition, those who have been given to wash their hands after this kind of intention are less likely to be engaged in other "cleaning" compensatory tasks, such as their volunteers."
Symbolic handwashing, use water/water for handwashing but not use soap, handwashing characterized by many religions is part of religious behavior, which includes Bahá'í religion, Hindu religion, Jewish religion, Tevilah and Netilate Yadaim, Christian religion, and Islam's Ozu religion, especially after doing some work.
Handwashing is mandatory in the Hindu, Jewish and Islamic religions.
And, every time before and after meals, it is mandatory to wash hands in the Hindu, Buddhist, Shik, Jewish, and Islam.
Workplace Risk Control for COVID-19
Occupational risk controls for COVID-19 are the application of professional safety and health-related methods for risk control to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
The appropriate risk controls on the workplace depend on the workplace and on the workplace, on the basis of a risk assessment of the sources of contact, the severity of the disease in the public, and the risk factors of the individual employees who may be afraid of COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk contact work involves minimal professional contacts with people and other colleagues, for which general measures to prevent infection are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, breathing training, and regular cleaning and cleaning of the work environment.
Medium-risk jobs include those jobs where COVID-19 is unknown or not suspicious, but the business place requires frequent or close contact with people who may be infected because of the prevalent disease in the public or because of international travel.
It includes those workers who have contacts with the public, such as in schools, in a high population working environment, and some more crowded retail areas.
In addition to the primary infection prevention measures, this group also uses enhanced capacity air filters in the risk control system, including keeping available personal protection equipment when facing an infected person with air flow, snage guard and COVID-19.
O.S.H.A. Health workers and people who work in Morga believe that the risk of contact with persons affected by COVID-19 is high or suspicious. The risk increases further if these employees apply the Aerosol-producing process or through this process collect samples or treat samples of persons affected by COVID-19 who are affected or suspicious.
Risk controls suitable for these employees include engineering controls such as debt-pressed air circulation houses, and personal safety equipment suitable for work.
The prevalence of COVID-19 in the workplace can have many effects.
Workers may be absent from work due to getting sick, to take care of others or fear of potential contact.
There is a demand for any goods and the way these goods are purchased (such as buying at times without occupation or through delivery or drive-three service (not purchased from the car) can change the type of business in both directions.
Finally, the shipping of things from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be interfered. Preparation and response plan for a infectious disease can be used to guide safeguard measures.
The plans target the levels of risk associated with the various workplaces and workplaces, including the source of contact, the risk factors arising from the home and society scope, and the personal risk factors of employees such as aging age or prolonged medical illness.
They also describe the necessary controls to target those risks and plans to be prepared for the circumstances that may occur as a result of the prevalence of the disease.
Preparation and reaction plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
The objectives of reaction to infection include reducing infection among employees, protecting people at risk of adverse health complications,ining business activities and reducing adverse effects on other companies in their supply chain.
Where the business is located, the intensity of the disease in the community affects the reactions taken.
The increasing format of hazard control is a structure that is widely used in occupational protection and health performance control.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, then administrative controls, and finally personal protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve separating employees from work-related risks without relying on employees’ behavior, and it can be the most affordable solution for implementation.
Administrative controls are changes in work-related policies or procedures for which action is required by the employee or employer.
Personal safety equipment (PPE) is considered less efficient than engineering and administrative control, but it can help prevent some exposure.
The staff must choose all types of PPE based on the risk, as applicable as well as properly fit (such as the receptor), consistently and properly wear, regularly check, maintain and replace and properly open, clean and save or cancel to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with low risk of contact have minimal professional contacts with people and other colleagues.
The basic measures for the prevention of infection recommended for all workplaces include repeated and well washing hands, encouraging employees to stay at home when they are sick, providing breath-related trains, tissue and waste discharge containers during clay and cough, being prepared for telecommunications or staged shift at different times of the day if necessary, empowering employees to use other equipment and equipment, and keeping the work environment clean and clean.
One essential step in protecting employees, customers, intervievers and others at work is to quickly identify and identify potentially infectious people.
All employees who have symptoms of severe respiratory disease are advised to stay at home until they are free from fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-changing drugs, and should flexible the vacation policies that allow employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family member, and employees should be aware of these principles.
According to OSHA, middle-risk jobs include those jobs where COVID-19 is unknown or not suspicious, but people who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 need frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8m) due to the prevalence of the disease in the public in the business places or a recent international journey to a place where the person has been widely spread COVID-19.
The staff can include those with whom it is necessary to communicate with the public, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate, such as those with whom it is necessary to communicate.
Workers in this risk group need to use receptors in rare cases.
If a person gets sick on the plane, the appropriate controls to protect the staff and other passengers include separating the sick person 6 feet away from the others, designating a member of the staff to serve the sick person, and giving the sick person a face mask or asking the sick person to cover his face and nose with a tissue during swelling or coughing.
The cabin crew should wear available medical gloves when responding to the call of the sick passenger or when touching the body’s liquid or potential polluted surfaces and if the sick passenger has fever, constant cough or breathing, it is likely that additional personal protective equipment should be used.
Gloves and other cancellable items should be removed in an organic risk bag, and the polluted surfaces should then be cleaned and revived. For commercial vessels, including vessels and other passenger vessels, risk controls include delaying the journey if you are sick, keeping yourself separate and immediately informing the vessels' medical center if someone has fever or other symptoms while on the vessel.
In the ideal case, the person who has been kept separated should have medical follow-up in the cabin. In the case of school and child care facilities, regardless of the infection in the public, if an infected person enters the school building, the CDC recommends that it be closed for a short time to clean or rescue.
When the disease spreads from the minimum to the medium level in the public, social distances can be implemented, such as the cancellation of field trips, meetings and other massive meetings, such as physical education or gathering music classes or dining in the cafeteria; increasing the distance between the tables, separating the time of arrival and vacation, limiting unnecessary interviews, and using a separate office health space for children with symptoms like flu.
When a large number of diseases spread into the local community, the strategy ofining social distance could be considered to further increase the school breakdown. The law enforcement workers who perform daily traditional activities are considered to have a low health risk by the CDC.
All law enforcement officials who have to contact people who have or are suspected of having COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protection equipment.
If employees come to close contact during anxiety, in that case, their duty belt and equipment should be cleaned and cleaned using a domestic saffy spray or wire before re-use, and the proof management method should be followed to control and cancel the PPE used.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and death-related service staff in high or ultra-high risk classes of contact.
Contact high-risk jobs include health care providers, assistants, laboratory and medical transport staff, who come to contact patients who are known or suspected to have COVID-19.
If the staff performs erosol-producing methods, or collects or pulls samples from patients who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, they become at high risk of contact.
Erosol-producing methods include entering the tubes, start-up methods of cough, bronchoscopy, some dental methods and testing or sampling by entering the material.
High-risk, death-related jobs include employees involved in the work of preparing their deaths that all people were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; it became very high-risk contact if they conducted an examination. Additional engineering controls for people of this risk-related group include COVID-19 being known or suspected to have separate houses for patients, when its solus-producing methods are performed.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be suitable for some healthcare and shabagar environments.
The samples should be managed in accordance with the warning of Biosafe Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends to divide them into separate waiting areas on the basis of whether arrival patients are suspected of having COVID-19. those who are known or suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 for people working within 6 feet and those who perform erosol-producing methods, OSHA also recommends receptors in addition to other PPE.
In addition to health tests, training and medical tests in the United States, a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program in the context of NIOSH-approved N95 or advanced filtering Phespis receptor must be used.
Other types of receptors can provide more protection and improve the comfort of the staff. WHO does not recommend cover, since COVID-19 does not spread through physical liquid ingredients, but it is a respiratory disease.
The WHO only recommends a surgical mask for the screening staff on the entrance.
For those who are collecting, serving or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any method of erosol-producing, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, googles, or face shilds, garments and gloves.
If an aerosol-producing process is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with a N95 or FFP2 receptor.
Looking at the lack of global P.P.E. supply, the WHO P.P.E. recommends the use of telemedicine, transparent windows, and those who are directly involved in the care work are only allowed to enter the home where a COVID-19 infected patient is, only to use the P.P.E. necessary for the specific work, to continue its use without removing the receptor during the treatment of multiple patients affected by the same disease, the P.P.E. has been provided to monitor and monitor the patient's home, not to use the P.P.E. necessary for the specific work, to continue its use without removing the receptor during the treatment of multiple patients affected by the same disease.

[Covid-19] Weight lighting and preparing for the future
Date of sending: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensed: CC0: No rights reserved
We see ourselves in a wonderful situation this month.
The worldwide COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that clarifies the worldwide human interconnection and our responsibilities to each other.
We have no anticipation for its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the global sympathy, cooperation and society building that is at the center of the organization.
The intimacy, confidence and care we have seen through emails, calls and chats among all our colleagues is a significant symbol of those incredible people with whom we are lucky enough to work with.
I am very grateful and proud to be your colleagues.
Last week, a man exchanged his praise with me for his work.
They reminded me how meaningful it is to be able to see Wikipedia for the world at this moment and how powerful it is to be available online and everybody.
Your work makes it possible, it is to keep you running the sites or funding our colleagues or keep our communities safe whatever you do.
The information provided by Wikipedia is needed by the world, now in a much greater amount than before.
It is a moment when not only what we do, but how we do it will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant changes from this next week in how we work together.
Compatible with our work and schedules.
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our approach and set a schedule for the coming days and months.
We thought it was an appropriate response to the situation we’re facing, and we considered the best way to maintain the organization at this time.
Most of us wanted to get rid of pressure and support our goals for a long time.
If you need to back the dial, there is no problem.
For all employees, contractors, and contractual employees:
Our daily work expectations until the next announcement will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week.
We’re not announcing holidays – if you’re able to work in more normal times, the mission can take you into use.
But the world is uncertain at this moment, and whether you need to take care of your loved one or bring the stuff or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don’t look at your time.
Do not work if you are sick.
It’s worth saying, but we’re saying it.
There is no need for sick holidays or PTOs - just tell your manager and help your team adjust calendar and schedules to make sure the main fields of work are covered.
(If you are positive for COVID-19, please inform Brian of T&C Ops so that T&C can help and make sure your situation gets the appropriate attention from the authorities).
The full wage will be paid to the working hours.
We’ve already said, and we’re again committed to respecting our promises to our contractors and colleagues working as our clock.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of the normal hours they work in normal circumstances.
This includes, if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use the work as a way to drive their mental stress from the world around us to a particular direction.
What we do can be incredibly fruitful, especially in such times.
Again, it’s about taking care of yourself.
We want you to keep in touch with your manager so that we know what can be expected and as well as compatible.
Some actions are considered indispensable.
There are some things we must do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (including others) work essential for which additional support may be needed.
We will start a process with all of our departments to evaluate the current goals and change our focus to cooperate in what is necessary for our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, just we all will focus on the most essential projects.
If you work slowly, you will not be hit later.
We do not plan to work twice after the overtime is cut.
You will not be expected to have extra hours of work to complete the work within the deadline, which is now not realistic.
We acknowledge that the situation has changed, and where appropriate we will work to set new goals and deadlines.
What happens with the APP (Annual Plan)?
To match our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we also want to match the deadline for the delivery of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our aim is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which gives employees more time to prepare budgets to prioritize the essential work, to take care of themselves and to take care of loved ones, as well as to accept the demands of all those people who want to work on a reduced schedule for the next few weeks or need to do so.
This extension of the time limit significantly reduces the work of the current plan and the overall pressure on the organization.
We will submit our proposals to the board next week and we will update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as possible as we receive the confirmation.
I would like to thank the APP team for your leadership in this case.
Office condition, contact and cleaning.
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues was probably in contact with the COVID-19 virus.
However, with a lot of caution, we hired a group of viral safi workers to revive all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
Each floor and lobby and elevator banks entering our floor used an antiviral solution of the hospital’s appropriate quality to revive.
The building is hiring its own service responsibility Protocol user products that help their renters to be safe.
We feel comfortable that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has exchanged its COVID-19 protocol with us and with all DC-based staff members.
Last week our DC office was moved to a fully remote setup in accordance with the instructions given to San Francisco.
Some of our NYC-based colleagues know that we were also talking about taking a location in Brooklyn.
The discussion continues but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work on a distance for the first time.
Our long-term remote colleagues know that it could be adapted, and wanted to give you some advice:
If the length of the meeting is too long, limit it to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to divide them into small portions for a few days.
Explain the meeting clearly, keep a discussion schedule and send the text materials in advance.
With tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connection, default the video.
Keep a lead to make each meeting easier, ask someone to observe the questions in the chat and keep an eye on the speaker list, and ask someone to write a note (or collaboratively take a note).
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to Tech Support.
Use your Wellness reimbursement for Snaps.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the shared work.
The HR management team is focusing on webinar-based organizational guidelines to help increase the foundation’s broadly distributed work.
Last week, we asked all community donors to cancel public events such as Edithaton, funded by Wikimedia, until the WHO announces that the deadline is over.
We inform them that we have understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to perform their agreed grant activities and no one will be punished for delaying or amending these goals.
This next week we will inspire additional guidance for Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
It seems that there is both depression for disturbance from the general mindset of the global community, but at the same time, the ability and clarity of the Wikimedia and elsewhere to pay attention to their own public appears to exist.
In the coming days, CRT is working to create a page on the meta-wiki, so that it can provide a space for the public to monitor the effects and follow our contacts with them.
Communications with COVID-19 related topics
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting on the next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates and answer your questions and spend some time connecting each other.
In this situation we are all united and we will help as we can.
In the middle of the time, you can continue to search for information from this email, and you can get other essential information about COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contacts with employees living in significantly affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow or coverage challenge, or if you need help in any other matter, please inform and do not hesitate to work with CRT.
We are here to assist and coordinate as needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive issues, please email to HR International Global Operations Director Brian Judan.
None of these changes should be seen as a breakthrough of our work and responsibility.
Instead, it is a recognition that at this moment we may have to adapt our tasks and responsibilities in a way that we have not done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can continue to work, provide the support that our dynamics need, and provide the service that the world depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will continue to wait for us.
Now it’s time to help each other and create space for the important work that is going to come in the coming weeks and months.
To do this, you all need the help, and so we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can be completely healthy when it comes to need.
Now, please - wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, the CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Dorin D, Gregory V, Hyme V, Joel L, Linate L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather WB, Hyme V, Jenin U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
B’angiotensin- Converter Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an stimulant linked to the outskirts of the lungs, lungs, heart, kidneys and intestinal cells.
ACE2 is resistant to the work of the relevant angiotensin-transforming enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) becomes a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also works as an entrance place to cells for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-modifying stimulator 2 is a zinc-combined metaloenzyme that is found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a N-terminal peptide M2 domain and a C-terminal colectrine renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, whose active place in the stimulator's action is dissolved on the surface of the lungs and other tissue cells.
The external domain of ACE2 is divided from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheds and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the blood flow and eventually dissolved through urination.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly connected to the alviolase-related cell membranes of the type II of the lungs, the small intestinal enterosites, the majority of the organs are connected to the endothelial and endothelial cells and the muscle muscle cells of the lungs.
Seribral cortex, strithum, hypothalamus and brenthem are also found in ACE2 mRNA expression.
The primary task of ACE2 is to act as the conversion balance of ACE.
ACE angiotensin I divides the hormone into vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 separates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phinylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it to vasodilatator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can distinguish several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
The ACE2 neutral amino acid carrier controls the transmission of SLC6A19 and is associated with heart disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as the main point of entrance to cells in some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (which virus is responsible for SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (which virus is responsible for COVID-19).
More specifically, the enzymetic domain of ACE2 connects SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 proteins to the surface of the cell, resulting in endocytosis and viruses and enzymes transferred to both the endosomes located in the cell.
This entry process also requires the priming of S protein by host serum proteins TMPRSS2, its prevention is currently under investigation as a potential healing. It has helped some suppose that the reduced levels of ACE2 in cells can help fight infections.
However, several professional societies and regulatory agencies have recommended proof ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy to continue.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "in comparison with the regulations, the risk of neumonia with the use of ACE inhibitors was significantly related to a 34% decrease.""
“In addition, patients treated with ACE resistants, especially patients with a high risk of stroke and heart failure, also had a lower risk of pneumonia.”
"The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in the death rate associated with neumonia, although its result was less than the most powerful in the general risk of neumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered an acute therapy for severe lungs damage and has been present to improve the lungs hemodynamics and oxygen connectivity of pigs, including symptoms of severe respiratory failure triggered by lipopolysacarides.
Half of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the work starts at 30 minutes, also the time of effect (stability) is 24 hours.
Various findings show that people who are unable to tolerate the first-class renin-angiotensin system inhibitor or resistant (RAS inhibitor) or have a disease in which an angiotensin II is increased, may have rhACE2 expectancy.
"b'COVID-19 apps are the mobile software applications that are designed to identify the contact as a response to the coronavirus epidemic of 2019-20, i.e. the process of identifying the person in contact with any infected person (""identification")."
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed with authorized government support in several areas and departments.
Several infrastructures have been created for the creation of communication identification apps.
Confidentiality concerns have been expressed, especially about the systems that app operates on the basis of identifying the geographical location of users.
Relatively unlawful access options include the use of Bluetooth signals to capture and log the user on other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate the functionality of supporting such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has jointly launched an application with Alipay that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used throughout more than 200 Chinese cities. a app called TraceTogether is used in Singapore.
The app was created by a local information technology group, it was published as an open source and it will be transferred to the government. North Macedonia “Stop the Corona!”, a Bluetooth-based app that aims to identify the signs of a potential infected person and provide a quick response to healthcare authorities.
The app was created by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
From April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the government announced that the connection search app is in a progressive phase of development and will be ready to work in a few weeks. similar apps in Ireland and France ("StopCovid") were planned."
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace Protocol. Russia is seeking to launch a geofensing app for COVID-19 patients who live in Moscow, so that they can make sure they don’t leave home.
Professor Ross Anderson at the Department of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge has listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including resulting positive and app acceptability being limited to a small portion of the population and lack of functionality.
In addressing the concerns about the spread of "coronavirus" applications, Apple has established a limitation that any type of enterprise may add coronavirus-related applications to its app store, limited to "governmental" or otherwise named enterprises."
Google and Amazon have applied the same kind of restrictions.
Those who promote confidentiality have expressed concerns about public monitoring disadvantages using Coronavirus apps, in particular about whether the monitoring infrastructure designed to cope with the global epidemic of Coronavirus will be completed after the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and more than a hundred organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such surveillance.
The agency has announced eight conditions regarding the governmental project:
“The supervisor must be “legal, necessary and proportional.”
to increase monitoring and monitoring;
Data use for the purposes of COVID-19 must be limited;
Protect information and unknown identity and demonstrate protection on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should be done to stop the spread of discrimination and marginalization;
The issue of sharing data with third parties must be clarified in the law;
Citizens must have the right to protest against protection and abuse.
"All "related stakeholders" including public health experts and cross-border groups will require significant participation. the German Keus Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporters Oehne Grenzen) (RSSF) have issued a checklist."
The aim of the proposed Google/Apple plan is to solve the problem of stable monitoring if the tracking processes from the operating systems of their devices are no longer needed.
Some countries used surveillance over network-dependent positions instead of apps, which removes both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid surveillance.
In Israel, network-based identification was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unpaid location information have significant potential confidentiality problems.
In any case, access to the personal location data of all systems of the central server is not required; multiple privacy storage systems have been created that only use the central server for intercommunication (see the section below).
A app-free system was used in South Korea to monitor the contact.
Instead of using an employed app, the system collected tracking data from various sources, including the data of mobile device tracking and the data of transactions on the card, and combined them and sent notifications through text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn about potential contacts, the government’s position-related information has been drawn to the public, some issues have been approved due to the extensive change in the information privacy law after the MERS’ appearance in the country.
This information is available to the public through many apps and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered to use both centralized and privacy-guarding systems.
Until April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been published.
Research that began at least in 2013 is a well-established idea of identifying confidential communications with a real organ of education. By April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts worked on confidential solutions, such as recording the proximity of other cellphone users using Bluetooth Loot Energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that has both central and decentralized methods and it is not a single code of behavior. Decentralized codes of behavior include decentralized privacy-protection close identification (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary communication numbers (TCN, fka communication numbers, CEN), privacy-sensitive behavior and processes for mobile communication identification (PACT) and more.
In these protocols, identifiable personal information never leaves the device and occurs within all the connected devices.
MIT Media Lab is developing the Privacy Group SafePaths, a platform for monitoring the extension of COVID-19 to use privacy-protection strategies when collecting and using location or road interconnection data.
It is based on a white paper entitled ‘Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic’ (Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic), which was published in March 2020. Another similar attempt was the Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, the company’s manufacturer of privacy technology was actually founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to communicate sensitive location and health-related information to other users and entitled persons, without prejudice to the privacy of the information.
On April 5, 2020, the Universal TCN Alliance was established by a number of teams aimed at reducing divisions and enabling universal interactivity to identify and warn apps, which was a key aspect of widespread adoption, including them basically the same methods and large-scale overwhelming behavior rules that were needed.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it had a free-source BlueTrace protocol that is being used by its government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that respectively control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to find people in touch, which will protect privacy according to their claims, which works on the basis of a mixture of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-guarding crypto.
They also published the details of the basic technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system has planned to divide into three stages:
To enable governments to create a confidentiality-saving app to find coronavirus, roll-out tools
Integration of this feature directly on iOS and Android: Google and Apple first distribute the system through the operating system updates and then delete it in the same method by resolving the problem of tech-up and infinite monitoring when a disaster occurs.
B’Drug Reposition (also known as use suitable for different purposes, re-profiling, performing new actions or transforming into remedial drugs) is an approved drug that is used for the treatment of a disease or condition different from the disease that was originally designed for.
It is a path of scientific research that is currently being followed for the development of safe and effective COVID-19 therapies.
Other research guidelines include a COVID-19 vaccine and the development of convolved plasma infection. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 medication specific proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
These binding sites analyze and provide reasonable projects for producing effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are Papine National Protein, RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase, Helicase, S Protein and ADP Ribofosphetase.
Hussein A, and others studied various compounds that recommended the clinical study design and were optimized and analyzed in its pre-clinical studies for the candidate's cornea similarity by most similar approved drugs to intensify the development of a powerful SARS-CoV-2 anti-drugs.
Chlorokine is a malaria-resistant drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.

The medicine was not approved by the FDA’s clinical trial process and only approved as a experimental treatment for emergency use for patients who are hospitalized but are unable to participate in clinical trials within the European Union.
"CDC said that "Use, dosage or stability of hydroxychlorocine for SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention and treatment" has not yet been proven."
“The doctors say, ‘There’s no alternative,’ they’re using the drug.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorocine in conjunction with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
A large scale of research is ongoing at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langon Medical School is conducting a test on the protection and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychlorokine.
“The Chinese clinical trials in Uhan and Shenzhen claimed that Favipirabi was “clearly effective.”
In the middle of 4 days, 35 patients in Shenzhen were negative, while 45 patients who did not receive it were 11 days.
In a study of 240 patients with neumonia organized in Uhan, half were given Fevipirav and half were given Umifenov.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the existing evidence to support the drug is insufficient and primary.
On April 2, Germany announced that they will buy drugs from Japan for storage and use the military to supply drugs to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to South China Morning Post, Sinzo Abe has proposed to the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in cases of severity of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those who are trying to get pregnant.
"A combination of anti-viral drugs for Lopinavir and Ritonavir, a study of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra) came to the conclusion that "no benefits were observed.""
The drugs were planned to prevent HIV from copying through attachment to the prototype.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to change the drugs to find a compound that will link SARS-CoV-2 to the prothesis.There are criticisms in the scientific society about the use of resources to change the purpose of medications specially developed for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) includes Lopinavir/Ritonavir in the international mutual support test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilliad Sciences as a treatment for Ebola viral diseases and Morberg virus infections. Gilliad Sciences later discovered that there was an antiviral activity of Remdesivir in in-Vito against multiple philo, neumo, paramox and corona viruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe diseases and infections.
Several preliminary pre-trial studies indicate that remedevis may have high genetic barriers for resistance. Several subjective trials are working on, including two trials conducted by the Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with a moderate illness and the other for people with an extra severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of vitamin C for hospitalization and infection for people with severe illness with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began trials for antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
The Japanese National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to conduct a thorough trial for the Alvesco (cyclisonide) in Tehran for the treatment of pre-infected patients infected with neural coronavirus, corticosteroids taken by breathing for swelling.
To determine the effectiveness of the treatment in Denmark, Germany and Austria, a type of test of angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 is ongoing with 200 patients hospitalized.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from light symptoms of COVID-19.
This study, called COLCORONA, took 6000 adults aged 40 or older who had COVID-19 and felt light signs that they didn’t need hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or who do not have an effective contraceptive method, are not eligible.
Several anticoagents are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular ozon heparin is widely used for the treatment of patients encouraging the Italian Medical Agency to publish instructions on its use.
It was announced on April 14 in Italy on a multi-centric study of the use of enoxaparin sodium in the preventive and relieving doses of 300 patients.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, regularly scientific attention has been focused on the reconstruction of antimicrobial drugs that were created for previous infections such as MERS, SARS and West Nile viruses.
RIBAVIRINE: RIBAVIRINE was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to China's 7th version guidelines.
Umiffenovir: Umiffenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to the Chinese version 7M guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been identified as a treatment for COVID-19 are likely to be used for new purposes:
Tosilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
The tests are also ongoing in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
B'A COVID-19 is a designed drug against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Although no vaccination test has been completed, there are several efforts in progress to create a vaccine of this type.

In April there were five vaccine candidates in Phase I Protection Study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, a major prevalence spread around the world, resulting in sufficient investment and research activities to create a vaccine.
Many companies are using published genome to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
It was said in April that the CEPI initiative’s conditions for creating vaccines are speed, production capacity, enormous amounts of application and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were working to research and develop to create effective anti-COVID-19.
The main platform targets that have advanced in stage I security studies include:
Nucleic Acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, mRNA -1273)
Infected virus carriers (Phase I developers and vaccine candidates: Cancer Biology, Adenovirus Type 5 Vector)
As CEPI scientists in April, 115 people in total are in the early stages of improvement, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (according to the Milken Institute, 79 people) and 37 have been as others, but the same is obtained from a slightly publicly published data (this is supposed to be planned).
Phase I-II tests conduct preliminary safety and immunity tests and more accurate, effective dosage determination times are usually performed on inactive, placebo-controlled and multiple sites.
Phase III trials, including the effectiveness of the vaccine testing for disease prevention and control groups, typically involve more participants, while monitoring adverse effects on favourable doses of the drug.
"From 79 vaccine candidates in active development (as confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been humanly evaluated (but still under the "productive" study)."

Social media posts have promoted a chart theory in which it is claimed that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and a drug was already available.
The patents listed in various social media posts are related to existing patents for genetic signs and vaccines for other types of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious disease caused by CIVIA ACUT RESPIRATOR SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, smell power loss and stomach pain.
The time of symptoms start from the arrival to the contact of the virus is usually about five days, but it can be from two to four days.
Although mild symptoms are seen in most cases, in some cases its progress can lead to viral neumonia and multiple organs failure.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million infections were in 210 countries and regions, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been healed. the virus spreads among humans primarily during close contact often through small thyroid cells caused by coughing, swelling or speech.
When thyroid cells are produced during breathing, they usually fall on the ground or above the surface rather than spread on a long distance.
After touching the polluted surface, people can become infected even by touching their eyes, nose or face.
The virus can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is most infectious within the first three days of the symptoms begin, although the symptoms are likely to spread before and in the subsequent stages of the disease. The ideal method of diagnosis of the disease is by real-time reverse transcription polymerosis chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swab.
Those who are suspicionally infected with the virus are advised to use the mask.
Recommendations for the use of common people's masks are different, some authorities recommend against their use, some recommend their use, and in other cases, their use is necessary.
Currently, COVID-19 has no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Local infections have been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Infected persons with the virus may be symptomatic or symptoms such as flu may be observed such as fever, cough, fatigue and breathing disorders.
Emergency symptoms include breathing, endless chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty awakening and bleeding of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical care is advised.
Relatively less common, symptoms associated with high breathing can be observed such as swelling, waterfall through the nose or throat pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as swelling, swelling, and diarrhea have been observed with a decrease of percentage.
In China, some of the infected people were initially seen only by choking and choking.
In some cases, this disease can progress to neumonia, multi-organ retardation and death.
This is called the phase of life.
The final phase of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can last from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people whose symptoms are seen will be seen within 11.5 days of infection. reports indicate that the symptoms are not seen among all infected.
The role of these non-symptomatic carriers in the case of infection is not yet fully known; however, the initial evidence shows that they may have a role in spreading the disease.
The ratio of infected people whose symptoms were not observed is currently unknown and is being studied, a report from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) says that 20% of all confirmed infected people were symptomatic while in the hospital.
On April 1, China's National Health Commission began to include non-symptomatic infects among its daily infects; on that day, 130 (78%) of the infected were non-symptomatic during the test.
Both worms and roses can bear more viruses.
When speaking stronger than speaking normal, the particles are more out.
A study in Singapore found that no-covered mouth cushion could result in small spots spreading up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally ventilated, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that bioarrosol infection may be possible and has given a positive sample of the viral RNA of the air collector placed in the outer hallway of the human home.
A number of therapeutic methods, such as Intuition and Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation (CPR), can result in breathing-related emissions to aerobic particles and result in aerobic spread.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through the mole, this risk is considered to be lower.When the symptoms are observed in humans, the virus is the most touching; the symptoms may be likely to spread before they become clear, but the risk is less.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not completely clear how the disease spreads easily, but one person usually infects two to three people.
In particular, up to one day on the cardboard, the virus was found as detectable in plastics (polypropyline) and in stainless steel (AISI 304) up to three days and in 99% grain up to four hours.
It changes depending on moisture and temperature.
If properly used, soap and detergents can also be effective; soap products break the fat protection level of the virus, disable it and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (operative biochemicals) are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, red samples were taken in the middle of two days after hospital reception began.
The first sample of five of the six patients showed the most full of viruses and the sixth patient showed the most full of viruses on the second day of the test.
CIVIA ACUT RESPIRATORY CORONAVIRUS 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a neural severe respiratory coronavirus, which was first separated from three people affected by neumonia associated with the group of Uhan's severe respiratory disease.
All the characteristics of the Nevel SARS-CoV-2 virus are seen in coronavirus related to nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus dies in domestic soap, which breaks its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 has a close relationship with the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most influenced organs by COVID-19 because the virus enters the pesticide cells through the abundant amount of the enzyme that is found in the type II alviolary cells of the lungs and the enzyme that converts the angiotensin to the enzyme 2 (ACE2).
"To connect with ACE2 to enter the cell, the virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike" (peplomer)."
In China, 12% of infected people who were hospitalized in the Uhan hospital had severe heart attacks and it was more common in severe diseases.
As a result of systematic inflammatory reactions and intestinal disorders during the development of the disease, the rate of cardiovascular symptoms is higher, but severe myocardial infarction may also be associated with the ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors go quickly into the heart and are involved in the heart.
Thromboosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were observed among ICU patients affected by COVID-19 infection and it may be associated with weak prognosis. The body-test of people who died in COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrate-associated lymphocytes.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tendency to move to the epithelial cell -ACE2 that connects the respiratory tract, severe COVID-19 patients have signs of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells among COVID-19 patients have been shown to be associated with inflammatory IL-6-secreted monosite and severe lung pathological recovery (recruiting).
The examination of the lymphocytic infiltrate has been.
The WHO has published a number of test protocols for the disease.
The ideal method of testing is using reverse transcription polymerage chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test is usually done on breathing-related samples obtained by the neferential swab; however, Nazal swab or thuthur samples can also be used.
The results are usually found within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be done, but they need to take two blood samples within a two-week interval and the results have a low immediate price.
Chinese scientists have been able to distinguish the coronavirus stren and express the genetic order so that laboratories around the world can develop a separate polymerage chain sales (PCR) test to detect infection by viruses.
On April 4, 2020, antibiotic tests (which can detect active infections and identify whether a person has been infected in the past) were in preparation for development, but have not yet been widely used.
In the case of the test, Chinese experience showed only 60 to 70% accuracy.
On 21 March 2020, the FDA in the United States approved the first local screening test for use at the end of that month. The diagnosis guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital of the University of Uhan recommend methods for the detection of infection based on the specific characteristics and epidemic-related risks.
Bipolar, multi-lobular ground-glass opecepticity, with a transversal, non-transversal and rear distribution, is common in the case of primary infections.
Depending on the progression of the disease, subplural priority, irregular paving (Lobular septal removal by filling variable alviolars) and unification can be observed.
There is very little information available about COVID-19's pathophysology and microscopic injuries.
The main pathological data of the Mona investigation is:
Macroscopy: flucose, pericarditis, long consolidation (water capture in the lungs) and palmonary relaxation
There are four types of viral neumonia:
Light Neumonia: Palmonary edema, Neumosite hyperplasia, large-scale atypical neumosites, lymphosite infiltration and multi-neucleated monster cell formation
severe neumonia: dispersed alviolary dispersed alviolary (DAD) including the dispersed substance.
The cause of severe respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia is DAD.
Neumonia Sarano: Organization of alviolary cavity extracts and interstitial fibrosis associated with the lungs
Blood: dispersed intravenous accumulation bond (DIC); leukarithroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include sitting at home, avoiding crowded spaces, frequently washing hands and breathing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and practicing appropriate health care and not touching the eyes, nose or face with the hand.
CDC has recommended Dhaka with face and nose tissue during cough or swelling and recommended using the inner side of the conveyor if no tissue is found.
The proper health of the hands is encouraged after cough or swelling.
CDC has recommended the use of public clothing cover to limit the participation of infection by non-symptomatic persons. Schools and workplaces are closed, travel is restricted and huge crowds are cancelled and social distance strategies are planned to reduce the contact of people infected with a large-scale group.
Distance maintenance instructions include that people will be at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away.
"There is no known drug that is effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since no vaccine is expected before 2021, so the main part of the COVID-19 control is to try to reduce the epidemic scratch, it is known as "plate the scratch"".
CDC also advises people to frequently wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the shower or if their hands are apparently dirty, before eating and after nose swelling, cough or swelling.
It is more recommended to use at least 60% alcohol-added alcohol-based hand sanitary only without soap and water, where commercial hand sanitary is not easily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
The activity of antimicrobial in these preparations is derived from ethanol or isopophanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antiseptics"".
Glycerol is added as a humactant.
People are driven by supportive care, which may include liquid therapy, oxygen support and other serious organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those who are suspected of being a viral carrier wear ordinary masks.
Extra-corporal membrane oxidation (ECMO) has been used to solve the problem of respiratory discomfort, but its benefits are still being considered.
Personal health and a healthy lifestyle and food are recommended to improve disease resistance.
The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to take care of hospitalized people with COVID-19.
In the U.S. Intensivists and Palmologists have organized recommendations for the treatment of various organizations at the Free Resource, IBCC.
There is no specific treatment for COVID-19 until April 2020.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (asithaminophen) rather than ibuprofen for initial use.
Warning should be taken to reduce the risk caused by viral infection, especially in healthcare environments when procedures such as injection or hand ventilation are performed that can create ventilated cells.
For health care professionals serving people affected by COVID-19, CDC also advises to keep people in a room (Airborne Infection Isolation Room, AIIR) in addition to the use of evidence warnings, touch warnings and ventilated warnings. CDC has described the instructions for the use of personal protection equipment (PPE) during the worldwide epidemic.
The recommended tools are: PPE Gaun, Receptor or Face Mask, Eye Protection and Medical Gloves. If available, Receptor (not Face Mask) is preferable.
The N95 receptor is approved for the environment of the industry, but the FDA has approved the masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against ventilated particles such as dust, but the effectiveness against certain organic ingredients is not guaranteed for unusual use.
If the mask is not found, the CDC recommends the use of the mask made at home as the face cover or the final wear.
The majority of the infected are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but some percent of the infected are serious.
Intuition can be avoided by the help of high-flow naval canal or by-level positive airway pressure, with some evidence of it, the type of respiratory support is actively studied in people with COVID-19 related respiratory failure for hospitalized people.
For those who are seriously ill, it is unknown whether each of these two will lead to the same benefit.
Some doctors choose to keep invasive mechanical ventilation through it because this strategy limits the spread of ventilated particles compared to high-flow nazzal channels. severe incidents are most common among older adults (who are over 60 years old and especially over 80 years old).
Many developed countries do not have sufficient hospital beds, which limit the ability of health management to cope with the issue of sudden increase in the number of serious COVID-19 infections that need hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% were filled in intensive care units, 2.3% of ventilation needed mechanical support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people infected with COVID-19 in hospitals are finally admitted to ICU.
COVID-19 develops severe respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) and mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as oxidation becomes increasingly uncomfortable.
To maximize oxygen distribution, the pressure control mode and high PEEP-capable ventilators are required, while the ventilator is required to reduce the risk of pneumothorax and pneumothorax.
High levels of PEEP can not be found in old ventilators.
The potential medical research began in January 2020 and a number of antiviral drugs are being tested.
Remedies seem to be the most hopeful.
Although the new drugs may take time until 2021, several of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advance testing.
Antiviral drugs can be used among people with severe diseases.
WHO proposed volunteers will take part in the testing of the effectiveness and safety of the potential treatment. where a person's life is seriously or immediately in danger, the FDA has temporary approval of the Consulate Plasma as a experimental treatment.
It has not been done the necessary detailed studies to prove it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to tackle the prevalence of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to identify the potential risks of "nick contact" and infection as a result using monitoring data.
Each user can check the status of three other users.
If potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-help, it also warns local health officials. Big data analysis of cellphone data is used to monitor people infected in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore and people in contact, face detection technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to monitor the data of people who were suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to protect people who could get in touch with infected citizens and to strengthen the quarantine.
Also, in March 2020, the German federal government agency distributed data of the Deutsche Telekom integrated telephone position to the Robert Koch Institute for the purpose of preventing the virus’s spread and research.
Russia has used face detection technology to identify quarantine breachers.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said that mobile phone operators told him that "40% of people are traveling whatever they do."
The German government has organized a 48-hour week-end hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called for a worldwide call for a creative solution against coronavirus spread.
People may experience illness from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of their own infection.
"BBC cited Rory O'Connor, saying, "Augmented social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, mental stress and economic disasters are a perfect disaster to harm human mental health and health.""
Similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common colds, this disease can progress very little or smoothly without any symptoms.
Small infected people are usually healed within two weeks, but those with severe or severe diseases may take three to six weeks to get healed.
Based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at risk of severe infections with COVID-19, but there is a lack of information about COVID-19.
In most seriously infected people, COVID-19 can rapidly increase in severe respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) which can cause respiratory disturbance, septic shock or multi-organ disturbance.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, unusual blood clot and heart, kidney and liver damage.
In 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19 there was an abnormality of blood flow, especially an increase in the period of prothrombin, while in 4% of those who were hospitalized with COVID-19 there was an abnormality of blood flow.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have seen an increase in liver stimulation (transminesis).
According to the same report, the period between the beginning of the symptoms and death, including five hospitalizations, was ten days.
However, the period between hospitalization and death of patients transferred to the ICU was seven days.
In a study of primary infections, the intermediate period from clarification of primary symptoms, including a full period of six to 41 days, to death was 14 days.
A study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC) found that the mortality rate in men was 2.8% while the mortality rate in women was 1.7%.
The histopathological tests of the pulmonary sample examination showed alviolary damage spread, including the release of cellular fibromyxide in both the lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in Neumosite.
The image of the lungs is similar to the acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was identified due to an increase in the levels of heart attacks or troponins.
According to data from March in the United States, 89% of those who were hospitalized had the disease since the beginning. The economic and medical facilities in a region could also affect mortality.
The rate of death from this disease is calculated not only due to these regional differences but also due to methodical difficulties.
Reduced mortality rates can be counted in excessive amounts.
However, the real thing is that death is the result of infection in the past, which means that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die.
The Hong Kong Hospital authorities observed a reduction in lung capacity of 20% to 30% in some people healed from this disease and lung scans indicated organ damage.
This may also cause post-intensive care syndrome after healing.
Until March 2020, it was unknown whether past infections provided effective and long-term immunity among people healed from this disease.
The likelihood of impotence based on the behavior of other coronavirus is very high, but in those cases, after the results of the positive test for coronavirus in the subsequent period, the recovery from COVID-19 has been.
These events are threatened to be due to further deterioration of permanent infections than reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has an animal source, through spillover infection.
The actual source is unknown, but in December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely managed by human infection.
A study of the first 41 confirmed infections of COVID-19 was published in The Lancet in January 2020, where the first date of the symptoms was as 1 December 2019.
The first side of the symptoms began on December 8, 2019, the official publications from the WHO.
Some methods are usually used to determine the number of deaths.
These numbers vary according to the region, and are influenced by the quantity of tests, the quality of the healthcare system, the treatment options, the period of interruption from after the initial infection, and the characteristics of the population, such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO determined deaths due to laboratory SARS-CoV-2 infection by the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 and laboratory SARS-CoV-2 infection by the medical or epidemically diagnosed COVID-19 by the deaths by the U07.2 code.
According to statistics from the Johns Hopkins University, the worldwide death and infection ratio will be 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) until April 17, 2020.
Other systems include the infected mortality rate (CAS FATALITY Rate, CFR) which identifies the percentage of those people who died from the disease and the infected mortality rate (Infection FATALITY Rate, IFR), which identifies the percentage of those people infected (diagnosed and not diagnosed) who died from the disease.
These statistics do not have a specific deadline and follow a specific population from infection to the diagnosis of infection.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about how many people have been infected.
The sub-centre of the infection in Italy, Casiglion Diada, which is a small gram of 4600 people, where 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangel, this disease spread through the Carnival Festival and spread among younger people, which is a relatively low cause of death, and all COVID-19 deaths may not be officially classified.
In addition, the German health system was not disturbed.
In the Netherlands, according to the assessment, blood donors may have about 3 percent of the antibodies.
69 people (0,004 percent of the population) were confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The effects of overdose and its mortality rates vary in men and women.
In studies conducted in China and Italy, the death rate among men is higher.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the end of the gap between men and women is in the 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent among men and 1.7 percent among women.
The exact causes of this gender difference are not known, but genetic and behavioral issues can be the cause.
Gender-based immune differences, the prevalence of smoking among women is relatively low and the development of complications among men at a younger age compared to women can play a role in higher mortality rates among men such as high blood pressure.
In Europe, 57% of the infected people were men and 72% of the dead in COVID-19 were men.
From April 2020 the U.S. government is not monitoring gender-related data of COVID-19 infection.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and SARS affect men and women separately.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women and are more likely to get into contact with the virus.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO does not mean, VI is a virus, D is a disease, and 19 is when the prevalence was first marked: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen in line with the international recommendations for naming for the prevention of calimalepone to avoid reference to specific geographical locations (such as China), species of animals or groups of humans. The name of the COVID-19-creating virus is referred to as CIVIA ACUT RESPIRATOR SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
“WHO uses additional “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 responsible virus” in public relations.”
"Both diseases and viruses are generally referred to as "coronavirus."
"The viruses and diseases during the initial prevalence in the Chinese city of Uhan were generally referred to as "coronavirus" and "Uhan coronavirus".
According to the 2015 Guidelines for the use of viruses and diseases in January 2020, the WHO 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV recommended severe respiratory diseases as temporary names for viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitation of capacity in the ideal supply chain, a number of digital manufacturers are printing health care materials such as the nail swap and ventilator parts.
For example, in an Italian hospital, when a ventilator valve is very urgent, the supplier is unable to provide it within the required period of time, a local new company has tested the manufacturer's product construction and produced the required 100 valves at night.
After the initial infection of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and rumors about the source, degree, resistance, medicine and other aspects of the disease emerged and rapidly spread online.
It is believed that humans are able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find any evidence of a copy of the virus between pigs, cows and chickens.
No medications or vaccines are approved for the treatment of this disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is ongoing by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a “reciprocal support test” to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds, which are the most promised of performance.
There are no vaccines, but various companies are actively producing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 clients to enter human cells.
Three methods are being searched.
First, the researchers observed the direction of creating a complete viral vaccine.
Whether inactivated or dead, the purpose of the use of this virus is to eliminate the immediate immune reaction of the human body to a new infection by COVID-19.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that sensitivizes the intolerance system in a specific subunit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this study identifies the S-spike protein that helps the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme client.
The third strategy is the Nucleic Acid Vaccine (DNA or RNA Vaccine, an active method for making vaccines).
For safety and effectiveness, experimental vaccines must be tested from any one of these strategies. On March 16, 2020, the first test of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The virus that causes this disease is found in a genetic code vaccine that is not damaged to be copied from it. The increase in antibiotic dependence has been indicated as a potential challenge for the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active subjects are ongoing from April 2020.
Seven tests were evaluating the already approved treatments for the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydroxychlorokine or chlorokine.
Most studies in China are being done for the use of antiviral drugs for different purposes, and nine phase III tests on Remedevir across different countries are to be by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the development of vaccines and drug candidates was prepared in April 2020. A number of existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remedev, Chlorokine and Hydroxychlorokine, Lopinavir / Retonavir and Interferon Biter in combination with Lopinavir / Retonavir.
In March 2020 there are experimental evidence of performance by Remedev.
A significant improvement has been observed among patients treated by the experimental use of remedies.
Phase III subjective trials are being organized in the United States, China and Italy. Chlorocine, which was previously used for the treatment of malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with initial results.
However, the research must be reviewed.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorokine.
However, when the Uhan Institute of Virology recommends giving a gram of medicine a day, it is noted that the double amount of this medicine can be extremely dangerous and deadly.
On March 28, 2020, people infected with COVID-19 issued the FDA’s emergency use of hydroxyclorocin and chlorocin on the basis of medical doctors’ considerations. The Chinese 7th version of the Guidelines also included interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir in relation to COVID-19.
Initial data suggests that high doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in Vitro.
The studies have shown that the primary spike protein prepared by Transmembrane Protease Serin 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for entry through SARS-CoV-2 through interoperable action with the ACE2 receptor.
There are severe restrictions on the study of clorocin and hydroxyclorocin, including or without azithromycin, which prevented the medical community from taking these therapies without further study.Vitro does not prevent Oseltamiv's SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
At the subsequent stage of severe COVID-19, cytokine disaster may be complicated.
There is proof that hydroxyclorocin may have rapid release-resistant qualities. After completing a small study, Tosilzhumab has been included in the medical guidelines of China's National Health Commission.
After seeing positive results among people affected by severe illness, it is passing the Phase 2 unaccurate test at national level in Italy.
Blood testing in a combination of serum feritin to identify cytokine disasters means preventing the progression of the disease, which is considered to be the cause of death of some affected people.
In 2017, CAR T cell therapy was approved by the FDA on the basis of past-related case studies for the treatment of steroid refractor cytokine release syndrome triggered by a separate cause.
Until today, there is no aggressive, controlled evidence that Tosilizumab is a fruitful treatment for CRS.
Those who have been cured from COVID-19 are being searched for purified and frequent antibodies produced by their immune mechanisms as a vaccine-free method of inactive vaccination given to those in need.
This strategy, with unrealised results, was designed for SARS.
Viral deactivation is the expected process of a special method through which passive antibodies therapy can mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other processes such as antibiotics depending on cell cytotoxicity and/or fagocytosis may be possible.
Other types of inactive antibodies therapy, for example, are on the way of development with the use of produced monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalent serum, which consists of a fluid part of the blood taken from healed patients and this virus can expand specific antibodies to rapidly organized.
Coronavirus diseases, a class of closely related syndrome
Lee Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital in Uhan, died from COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
