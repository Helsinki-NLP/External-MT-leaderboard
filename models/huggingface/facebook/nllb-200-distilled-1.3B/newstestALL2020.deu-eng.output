Fire in French Chemical Plant Put Out
The fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished, the Normandy prefecture announced on Friday. The fire broke out in the night of Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was deployed with about 200 fire trucks.
The fire was contained
The residents were told not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the US billionaire Warren Buffett's company Lubrizol and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
The plant employs about 400 people, and has made headlines in the past - for example, when methanthyl gas leaked in 2013 and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs.
Woman quits her job to search for her missing dog for 57 days
For two months, a Washington woman searched for her missing dog, even quitting her job to do so. The seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from a hotel room while on a short vacation in Montana. For 57 days, the dog was missing from sight - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick", Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left their dog Katie in the hotel room while they were going to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They searched for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had scared the dog .
Hoping that Katie could stay somewhere else in the hotel, Carole King went to the front desk. "The clerk says, 'She left about four, four and a half hours ago,'" recalls Carole King to Daily Inter Lake.
With flyers and Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog, but days turned into weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope", said Carole King, who quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a call: A man called to say that Katie was in his backyard. But when King arrived, Katie had already disappeared again. She was searching the neighborhood and suddenly her dog was under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go", King recalled in "Daily Inter Lake". "Tears were flowing. People stopped in their cars, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found her".
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday 27 September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. The fate of most of these remains unclear. The opposition speaks of a "terrifying" scale.
The German army has been losing weapons and ammunition - many of them without a trace - since the beginning of 2014, the army reported the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition, according to a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defence, which the editorial network Germany reports.
According to the paper from the office of the State Secretary for Defence Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon component and 3474 rounds of ammunition have so far been recovered.
The extent of weapons and ammunition losses in the German armed forces was "frightening", said Left-wing MP Martina Renner. This was all the more true since hardly anything had been found during investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "dull balance sheet". Renner criticized that the listing did not show whether the missing ammunition included those found in connection with the investigation against the suspected terrorist, Franco A.
The oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the Iranian port
More than two months after being identified by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker Stena Impero left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday.Ship monitoring data from Refinitiv showed that the tanker moved and left the Iranian port.The port of destination was named as Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker was originally released by the Iranian government on Monday but remained in Iranian waters until the shipping company said it would wait for an official statement from Tehran.
The Stena Impero was brought into the Strait of Hormuz on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on suspicion of violating security regulations, but it was believed that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary detention of an Iranian oil tanker off Gibraltar, which belongs to the United Kingdom.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea lanes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region have escalated immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the United States and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel praises the courage of the people in the peaceful revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has praised the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a celebration of the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt.
Musk is aiming for an extradition record .
Tesla's quarter may be a record-breaking one, despite a surge in deliveries, with recent losses at the electric car company.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a big boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have a chance to reach our first quarter of 100,000 deliveries", Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
Musk's circular said that demand is high enough for Tesla to place 110,000 orders, and the challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly, with Tesla having to provide as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked it: Tesla's stock went out of business with a gain of over six percent. The price has not risen this strongly in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well over 95,000 cars, reaching its record high.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This requires six-digit numbers in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were recent losses.
Mystery solved: Why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found this out by using experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. They also reported that progress had been made in understanding why children resist tickling so violently only to demand more.
Finally, it was discovered that the mere approach of a tickling hand triggers laughter before it even touches it, because of a deep layer in the cerebrum that triggers laughter when the tickling is expected.
According to the report, previous research has shown that rats respond to human tickling with ultrasonic "laughter" transmitted by the part of the cerebral cortex that is central to processing haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touching
It had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touch and other people's touch - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. But the Berlin researchers found in experiments on rats that laughter is suppressed, as is the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex, when a person touches himself. This is also true when living things clean themselves. During the contact and tickling by others, however, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh have been increased.
But if the self-touch and the other person's touch occur at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed, which suggests that the rat brain just can't distinguish between self-touch and other people's touch, and the new findings suggest that people can't tickle themselves because self-touch activates a brake in the cerebellum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves, and in the experiment they sometimes stopped this initiation prematurely, displayed flight or fear stiffness, and this ambivalence was similar to that of children.
Disaster averted: Large fire extinguished at French chemical plant
A major fire at a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished, the Normandy prefecture told AFP on Friday. The fire broke out in the night of Thursday.
The authorities said that no substances dangerous to health had been released. The samples taken did not give any cause for concern, as Pierre-Andr√© Durand, the prefect of the city, said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was deployed with about 200 fire trucks.
Schools and kindergartens have been closed
Residents were told not to leave their homes, buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
The factory is owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett 's Lubrizol Company .
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The plant belongs to the US billionaire Warren Buffett's company Lubrizol and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
The chemical plant has made headlines in the past, for example, when methanthyl gas leaked in 2013 and the area smelled of rotten eggs, and in 2015, when a mining accident caused about 2,000 liters of oil to leak into the city's sewage system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first sitting of Parliament after the lifting of the forced recess on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU on 31 October without an agreement if Brussels does not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. How he wants to achieve this is unclear, however.
On Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honour Jo Cox's memory and bring this country back together would be to leave the EU".
Oslo and Ut√∂ya bombing memorial unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Ut√∂ya, which killed 77 people, a memorial to the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose figurines. They commemorate the roses that thousands of people had laid in front of the Oslo Cathedral in the days and weeks after the attacks.
The project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be unveiled at the same venue - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims.
On 22 July 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik detonated a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and then shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party on Ut√∂ya Island.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker Stena Impero, which was detained in Iran, was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in the Iranian President Rouhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker Stena Impero, which has been held in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters after being cleared by Iranian authorities and is on its way to Dubai, the shipping company Stena Bulk said.
The Stena Impero has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now heading to Dubai for medical examinations, the company's chief executive Erik H√•nell said.
The Foreign Office in London called the seizure illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law", it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had detained the tanker on July 19 on charges of violating maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well, H√•nell said. They have behaved professionally in the past ten weeks in the face of the difficult and exhausting situation. The shipping company is now working to reunite them with their families as quickly as possible.
The British government suspected that the "Stena Impero" was a reaction to a similar incident in Gibraltar, where a supertanker carrying Iranian oil, which was supposed to be bound for Syria, was chained in early July in violation of EU sanctions against the war-torn country of Syria.
Iran has called it "piracy" and threatened to punish it, but in mid-August the Adrian Darya-1 was finally released, prompting suspicions that it was a barter to free the Stena Impero, which London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea lanes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region have escalated immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the United States and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
The nuclear dispute between Tehran and Washington is the cause of the tensions between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The United States had withdrawn alone from the international nuclear agreement in 2018, which was supposed to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been pressuring the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to enforce a stricter and so far extended agreement in other areas. Iran resists the pressure.
Because of the Stena Impero dispute and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil rigs in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition to provide military protection for merchant ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz to the UN General Assembly in New York.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India is actually destined to be a "war winner". In the face of the punitive tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to reposition themselves. Finance executives of Asian companies considering moving their production from China to another country cite India as one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. This is not only due to the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be designed to play a more significant role in the global, broadly-branched production chain.
But now India has come under Trump's own scrutiny. In a White House rant, denigrating the country as a "tax kingdom", the US withdrew trade concessions for 2,000 products from the emerging country in early June. The US accuses India of imposing prohibitive tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the friction with India is, of course, only a side show. Moreover, America views the world's largest democracy through the security glasses. Delhi and Washington are concerned about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a wave of American punitive tariffs against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term, should therefore be safe.
The problem, however, is elsewhere: the empirically-confirmed thesis that open markets accelerate economic development is in a difficult position in the socialist Republic of India, even under Modi. His reform zeal is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multinational state for too long. Companies now get building permits faster. They benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more effective insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for more rapid liquidation of failed companies with high debts.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, India has seen a lot of improvement in the first five years of Modi's rule. But this is not the case in trade policy.
In the West, Modi is seen as a vigorous reformer who is radically renewing his country's economy. This impression is due in part to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. But at heart, the "India First" advocate never shied away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the closure of their industries are among the main constituents of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.
The funeral of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French president Jacques Chirac is reportedly due to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at Montparnasse Cemetery in the south of the French capital, AFP news agency reported, citing Chiracs' family. The funeral will be held in a close family circle. A public funeral was scheduled for Sunday at the Paris Invalides' Hospital, media reported.
Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The world's best was already in the goal when heartwarming scenes took place in the chilled Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men's 5000m, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to sway dangerously. He could barely keep his feet up for 300 meters before the goal, running in an unhealthy bent posture, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly subdued him and supported him and dragged the last half of the stadium round to the finish. The forces at both of them were still enough to stop the running wristwatch after the finish. As if the scene had not already been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing", Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly attracted the attention of the gathered journalists. Shy, he first shrugged off, didn't want to talk about his heroic deed at all. Finally, he wanted to set his personal best time, and when he realized that this would be difficult, he just wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Championship. Under normal circumstances, he would not even have been allowed to start. "That's why I'm proud to run for my country here", he said.
He did it that evening with a lot of energy - and more intensity than he could have imagined. Because this feat will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even gave his rival Busby the lead at the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, just five minutes behind the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this preliminary. It had not been worth it at the end, because Busby, who only came to the finish with a lot of help, was disqualified by the World Athletics Federation at the very end.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies in Lisbon, had entered the race to set a personal best time at the World Championships in Doha. Although according to official data he managed to do it in 18:10.87 minutes, he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes once". However, only in training, best times do not count.
Millions of Egyptians prepare for wild day of protest
In Egypt, security has been stepped up in anticipation of possible anti-government protests, with police presence in central Cairo on Friday increased, several subway stations closed and roads around central Tahrir Square blocked.
In recent days, police have stepped up their road checks and searched pedestrians' phones, some for messages and photos related to the protests.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, hundreds of people took part in protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansoura against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whom critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. No such open protest against the political leadership had been seen in Egypt for years. Egyptian entrepreneur and actor Mohammed Ali, who launched the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "million-man march" in central squares in the country on Friday. Ali calls for a "people's revolution".
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise, according to two groups of observers.The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests as of Friday.The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported more than 2,000 arrests.These figures were initially not independently verifiable.The government did not confirm or comment on the figures either.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were "arbitrarily arrested" "just because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time,'" HRW said, citing lawyers for detainees.The charges against those arrested range from "spreading false information" to membership in a "terrorist association", according to their lawyers.In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform and in civilian clothing also interrogated and searched random bystanders, according to HRW.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country, saying the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: mail order retailers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods, with about 20 million returns ending up in the trash.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
The Ministry of Finance said that although companies could not be exempted from sales tax on donations in kind, the dealers could consider the market value of unsold returns so low that they would have to pay no or little sales tax.
Researchers at the University of Bamberg found that German citizens return about one in six packages they order online, and that about four percent of the goods - some 20 million items - ended up in the trash.
The Green Group leader, Katrin G√∂ring-Eckardt, called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to issue a decree clarifying that companies can give free donations to charities for non-commercial products and that donations should not be penalized, not only for online sales but also for other businesses from the model shop to the hardware store.
Banksy art auction: There's never been a better time to sell this painting
The famous work of street artist Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is going up for auction soon.
Banksy's work, which he says "underlines the return of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy to the basic animal and tribal way of life", is set to go on sale at Sotheby's in London on Saturday, before being auctioned on October 3.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in the southwest of the UK, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had re-exhibited the painting - coinciding with the original Brexit date of 29 March. On this occasion the work, formerly called "Question Time", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The painting could change hands for a million dollars.
The UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been in a tough fight with the opposition in the first session of the House of Commons on Wednesday after the Supreme Court lifted a forced pause imposed by Johnson.
It's not the first time Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has intervened in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in southeast England, he painted a picture of a man smashing a star on the European flag with a chisel. The work is seen daily by thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a walk in the park
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fierce verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, the current controversy is a "walk in the park", Dominic Cummings said at a book launch on Friday. "We enjoy it. We're going to leave (the EU) and we're going to win".
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in recent days, accusing them of "treason" against the people, and he dismissed as "humbug" accusations that he could put MPs at risk by making them the target of death threats.
Cummings said the only way to restore calm was for MPs to finally respect the British decision to leave the EU, and it was not surprising that people were upset that Britain had not yet left the EU three years after the referendum.
In the face of the heightened mood, even the bishops of the Church of England called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak to each other with respect", said a statement. "And we should listen".
Pakistan Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
In his first speech to the UN General Assembly, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has made an emotional appeal to the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise, another war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said Friday at the UN General Assembly in New York. "If it goes bad, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst". The United Nations has a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it".
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each control a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo are demanding the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is responding to the current protests in Egypt with a harsh hand. It is firing live ammunition at the population, with over 2,000 detainees joining the 60,000 political prisoners already in jail. Protests have never been safe in Egypt. But since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario similar to the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation, where poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one's own government drove millions onto the streets, a problem that even the Sisi regime is not able to address, no matter how hard it takes on opponents.
Today, one in three Egyptians lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is at 10 percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who to finance: Nestl√©, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression, but also the largest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. This was the case before el-Sisi. The Egyptian people have a lot of experience with authoritarian regimes, and the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It becomes critical whenever large sections of the population have difficulty affording a bottle of water at all.
T√ºv checks at terminal: BER chief: No more showstoppers for capital airport
The two-month test of the complex network of BER fire protection systems was completed, and the operators were satisfied with the progress made, but the T√ºv is not yet complete.
After extensive T√ºv tests at the terminal of the future capital's airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year, said supervisory board chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control board.
Airport manager Engelbert L√ºtke Daldrup spoke of a successful test but said there were still shortcomings in the terminal to be worked out. "We have many details, but we don't have a real showstopper".
However, there are indications that the time reserve is no longer too large.The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the building office during the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of power cable deficiencies remain to be remedied, and T√ºv intends to review them by February. "To create the conditions for the start of operations here, intensive work on the deficiencies must continue", said a written statement.
L√ºtke Daldrup said that in many cases it is a question of lack of evidence, less of new cables. There is also no approval for all the duvet covers on which the cable tracks hang. The airport manager expects that this will be available by the end of the year.
The problem is that the fire protection system at the entrance to the station under the terminal still does not work satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke screen covers that close down in case of fire like a screen to prevent the smoke from spreading. They go too far down. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there should be new experiments with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
The airport was originally scheduled to open in 2011, but construction costs have increased from two billion euros since 2006 to an estimated 6.5 billion euros when it opens next year.
Since passenger numbers have increased significantly in Berlin, the authorities are planning to expand the airport, which will be discussed at a special meeting of the supervisory board on October 18, as announced by chairman Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finance director Heike F√∂lster will join Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, and personnel manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked F√∂lster for putting the airport's finances on a firm footing.
Chemnitz: Automatic machines for drugs blown up - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs and blew up several vending machines in the Chemnitz area.
The number of cigarette and parking ticket vending machines in Chemnitz and the region which have been blown up has increased sharply over the past two years, causing millions of dollars in damage.
The police arrested a 33-year-old German after two explosions at the end of May on B√ºrgerstra√üe and Furtherstra√üe in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the cause of explosive explosions in the theft unit with particularly serious case of theft, which was conducted by the Chemnitz Criminal Police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed to a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "The loot was apparently used to finance his drug addiction". The bomber had only exploded four parking ticket machines on the B√ºrgerstra√üe between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage is at least 60 000 euros!
The bomber is now in custody and the police investigation is ongoing.
It's possible he was also responsible for other bombings in Chemnitz and surrounding counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is reversing its strategy for Vienna Airport amid price competition with low-cost carriers such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa's subsidiary AUA is taking over "commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", an Austrian Airlines spokesman confirmed to the APA on Friday.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. This will be taken over by the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesman explained.The flight times will be coordinated with connecting flights.The aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub on the one hand and to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states on the other.
According to AviationNetOnline, Eurowings is no longer operating in Vienna as a production company for its sister AUA, with Barcelona and Rome being served with AUA flight numbers but mainly with Eurowings aircraft. The on-board product is to be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants are from Eurowings. Eurowings flights starting with AUA flight numbers are no longer operated in Terminal 1 but, according to the report, as AUA in Terminal 3.
The Commission has decided to extend the deadline for the submission of applications for the approval of the new rules for the marketing of certain products to the European Union, which is the date of the submission of the application for the approval of the new rules.
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary's campaign claim that Lauda will have overtaken AUA in five years was met on Friday by AUA's chief executive Andreas Otto: "We will remain number one in the location, in five, six or ten years".
Queen's granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: When they were children, the cousins were best friends. Now the last of the four is getting married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British royals: During the Italian holidays earlier this month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have proposed to his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31).
"We are extremely excited to announce our engagement, we are both so excited to embark on this adventure together and can't wait to actually be married", the couple, who have reportedly been together since October 2018, said in an official statement.
And he goes on to say, "We share so many similar interests and values, and we know that this will help us a lot in the years to come, full of love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie took the pictures .
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and posted on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is scheduled for 2020, but details on the date, location and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
But what is certain is that the wedding of the ninth in line to the British throne and the real estate mogul will be a similarly big party as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on the causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy eating - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the genes of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
By analyzing the genes of 9,000 people, Hamburg and Switzerland scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular disease.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday.The Kuehne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros.The Swiss high-altitude hospital Davos, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
The report also highlights the importance of the European Union's role in the fight against poverty and social exclusion, and the need to ensure that the EU's efforts to combat poverty and social exclusion are accompanied by effective action to combat poverty and social exclusion.
Currently, the clinic said, disease-causing changes in DNA - called mutations - are known in more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, and about 200 are added each year.
The aim of the five-year project, according to the initiators, is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks.The data could also be useful in research into other folk diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Centre.
The chairman of the Kuehne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kuehne (82), also stressed that there was a strong desire to use the data to investigate other diseases as well.The foundation's clinic in Davos has so far mainly treated allergies.Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine and a professor of bioinformatics are to be established on the medical campus there.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who are also taking part in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, according to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world.
The UKE says that a person's genetic material can be deciphered in 24 hours. The cost of doing so is 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing in the world, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is to begin on October 1, and all 9000 samples are to be analyzed by the end of 2020.
Nigerian police free hundreds of battered boys
In Nigeria, police rescued more than 300 boys from a Koran school who had been tortured and abused.After receiving information from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of them still minors, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught the Koran and "improved" but in fact, the students were held by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhuman conditions", Sabo said.
The Koran school reportedly existed for about ten years. Residents had called the authorities' attention to repeated irregularities in the facility. Parents were shocked when they were informed about the conditions at the Koran school, Sabo said. They had no idea of their children's suffering. The operator and six employees were arrested, according to police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools, which replace the often deficient state institutions. The people in the region are often attacked by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, over the past ten months, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border into neighboring Niger.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police free 400 children from school
Police have rescued nearly 400 students from appalling conditions at a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were in chains and some had visible injuries that suggest torture", said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna city.
The children were discovered on Thursday in an Islamic school where the conditions were "inhumane" and the school principal and six teachers were arrested after the liberation operation.
The children, all boys, were held in chains and held like slaves at their school, some were sexually abused, and TV images showed skinny and injured students in a noticeably poor state of health.
World Cup: Messi and Klopps are again accused
Football "Signature not valid"
J√ºrgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe are honored
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Federation is awarding the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year.
After Nicaragua's captain said he never voted in the World Cup, FIFA has been accused by other countries.
Many things have been found to be infamous in FIFA in recent years: the World Cup donations, the dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials.
But after Nicaragua's captain complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account.
FIFA apologizes for the fact that "the signatures on the ballot papers were in capital letters and therefore not valid".
Sudan's coach also surprised
The Sudanese Football Association (FIFA) has also expressed concern over the election, saying that while the situation in Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese Football Association (SFA) has stated that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was ultimately rated: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in second place and Sadio Man√© in third.
The Nicaraguan captain Juan Barrera also made accusations: "Did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the details of my vote are wrong, thank you", he wrote.
The association said in a statement that the voting papers had been "erroneously" filled in with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan team, but that the second captain, Manuel Rosas, had actually been chosen. "We take responsibility for the administrative error", the statement said. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official FIFA list".
The other cases are now being investigated by FIFA, but it stresses that the selection process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
Ukraine: Republican leaders call for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly called for an official investigation against U.S. President and party ally Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important", said Republican Governor of the U.S. state of Vermont Phil Scott. "Where it goes from here is determined by the facts that are established". He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment process can lead to the removal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the phone to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have so far held back from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair, with only a few expressing discomfort. Scott's comments are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already repeatedly spoken out against Trump's policies, such as the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Another senior Republican, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, spoke out in favor of the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation", Baker said. "The proper course of action and the responsibility of Congress now is to investigate and get to the bottom of it".
Scott and Baker, as governors of the United States, have no formal say in the proceedings against Trump, which are decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first senators of the Republicans have also expressed themselves critically about the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing".
The affair could lead to the launch of impeachment proceedings against Trump, which the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced will be investigated, accusing him of abusing his power to influence foreign interests for his own political gain.
There is no exact timetable for impeachment proceedings. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could push for a so-called impeachment. But the decision on an actual impeachment would fall to the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The chances of success of such a procedure are therefore low. No US president has yet been impeached.
Were there torturers on board Racket's Sea Watch?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily for allegedly raping and murdering in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had illegally entered the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship Sea Watch 3 and 53 Libyan refugees on board.
The three men, who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps, may have arrived in Italy on the Sea-Watch 3 and were arrested in a reception camp in Messina, Sicily, after migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot rule that out, but we have no reliable information about it ourselves", Sea Watch spokesman Ruben Neugebauer told the German Press Agency.
Police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country raped, tortured and even murdered Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea and two Egyptians, Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A. (24).
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on board. "We cannot scan who the people are. They are coming without passports", Neugebauer said. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators are also on board. "It is therefore very important that this is investigated".
Italy's right-wing former interior minister Matteo Salvini demanded an immediate apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aiding illegal immigration.
Musk is trying to break Tesla's record for deliveries.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a big boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have a chance to hit our first quarter of 100,000 deliveries", Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
Musk's circular said that demand is high enough for Tesla to place 110,000 orders, and the challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly, with Tesla having to provide as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked it: Tesla's stock went out of business with a gain of over six percent. The price has not risen this strongly in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well over 95,000 cars, reaching its record high.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This requires six-digit numbers in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
US budget dispute: only a bridge financing again
The new fiscal year will begin in the United States on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional funding until November 21.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase spending ceilings for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without spending plans ahead of the new fiscal year that begins on October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and passed a Continuing Resolution (CR) through November 21. Without such a resolution, a shutdown, a partial shutdown of the federal administration, would have occurred at midnight on Monday. President Trump still has to enforce the resolution.
Shutdown averted
The Federal Government is currently being funded at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the fiscal year ending Monday 2019 because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending bills allocating funds to the various departments and agencies in time. The Federal Government cannot therefore benefit from the expanded spending framework for the new fiscal year from $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve bills in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. But the spending bills reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly majority-qualified.
The debate is divided mainly over the allocation of resources for the areas of homeland security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion for the wall, one of President Trump's top priorities. The Democrats are bothered by the wall plans and its funding, which is actually intended for other military construction and projects. The dispute over the wall had escalated as early as December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
The wall is where the ghosts part
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the quality of the public services provided by the Member States, in particular the provision of information on the quality of public services and the quality of the services provided by the public authorities.
In the face of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending bills in time, and the associated threat of a shutdown, ideas to automate the process are gaining popularity.Template S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue funding the federal government at the previous year's level, halt travel by lawmakers and withhold their salaries until the new annual spending plans are presented.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, the use of artificial insemination is to be extended to single women and lesbians: the National Assembly of Paris voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill to allow all women to use in vitro fertilization, which is expected to increase the demand for anonymous sperm donation.
The proposal still needs the approval of the Senate, and in the three-day emotional debate, right-wing critics warned that many "children without a father" could grow up in the future.
The new regulation is the core of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agn√®s Buzyn defended as a "chance" for society, depicting the modern family, where there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents.
Infertility with dead husband's sperm continues to be banned
The National Assembly, on the other hand, rejected by a narrow majority an amendment that would give widows access to their dead husband's sperm for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and the UK, artificial insemination is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women have complained in vain about the release of the sperm of a deceased person.
Many members of President Emmanuel Macron's governing party La R√©publique en Marche (The Republic in Motion) and opposition lawmakers have spoken out against artificial insemination using the sperm of a deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be subject to "double mourning" if her husband's death left her childless.
The initiators of the now-failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow may in future be allowed to be fertilized with the sperm of a stranger but not with that of her own partner.
The French government has announced that the use of artificial insemination is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot have children, but must be married or have lived together for at least two years.
In Germany, theoretically, all women can be used for artificial insemination - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: calls for airworthiness clearance for universities are growing
The university has a lot of flying, so the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in the future, too, and the rectors say they don't have the money, but now they're under pressure internally.
The university also has to limit flying.
The debate on a climate tax on flights from universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break, is back on track. After the Rectors' Conference of the State reacted skeptically to a similar initiative from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students from six Baden-W√ºrttemberg universities and one Pedagogical University are calling for compensation for business flights. This is "urgently necessary" as a first step, while there must be a broad debate on the avoidance of flights, their statement says.
Russia again detained North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the arrested were allegedly fishing illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 North Korean fishermen had already been arrested. At that time, there was a gun battle between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries.
The North Korean authorities have said they are investigating the incident and that the North Korean fishermen were travelling in Russian waters where the Russian coastguard is patrolling to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 squid seized
The Commission has also been informed that the Commission has decided to initiate a review of the measures taken by the Member States to ensure that the information provided by the Member States is correct.
Russia's fisheries authority has not issued fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local businessmen.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently complained about the environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen who used narrow-mesh synthetic nets, which are banned in Russia, to catch small creatures from the sea and simply dump them into the sea, where they would take 200 years to decompose.
18,000 to come: US lowers asylum cap
The most generous nation in history, Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officials at the White House.
The richest country on earth is isolating itself from asylum seekers: the State Department in Washington confirmed that the ceiling for the legal entry of refugees will be further reduced.
The US government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the admission of new refugees once again. In the 2020 fiscal year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the US State Department has explained. In the fiscal year that has almost ended, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The administration of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the willingness to accept asylum seekers from around the world in recent years, while the previous administration of Barack Obama had much higher admission limits.
The targeted cap of 18,000 would be the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was introduced in 1980, but the State Department nevertheless described the United States as "the most compassionate and generous nation in history", a phrase that strongly echoes the language of the current U.S. president.
A "responsible approach" to refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild, Trump said.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal off. To finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had declared a national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure over the Selenskyy affair and a potentially threatening impeachment process.
The US government plans to focus on two groups of refugees in the future: people persecuted for their faith and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have been put in danger as a result, according to the State Department statement.
The United States wants to ensure that people from the "northern triangle" of Central America in particular seek asylum in other countries. In this context, the United States has signed migration agreements first with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
A female orangutan was moved from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a captive station for apes in the United States at the request of the Argentine judiciary. "Sandra", born in 1986 at the Rostock Zoo, was granted the rights of a "non-human person" and her release was therefore mandatory.
Since the 53-kilogram human ape is unable to adapt to life in the wild, it will be living in the open enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida, where 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees are already housed, including Bubbles, former pet of pop star Michael Jackson.
After her birth in Rostock, Sandra spent several years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995.
Swiss record for the Extremberg climb: 550 meters in 46 minutes
Extremberg climber Dani Arnold has won a new hussar ride on the almost 3,000-meter-high Great Tinne in the Italian Alps.
Without nets, double-floor or other equipment, the Swiss conquered the 550-meter-high north face of the Great Pinnacle in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans and a T-shirt and supported only by complete freedom from dizziness, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds to climb, breaking the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the record holder in free solo speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The US sportswear manufacturer Nike has posted a significant profit surplus despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit rose to $1.4 billion in the past quarter, up 25 percent from the same period last year, the company said Tuesday. The main reason for this is the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", which allows the Adidas competitor to reach its customers directly online.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period to the end of August, with Nike sales rising the most in China, up 22 percent, helping the Beaverton, Oregon-based company to benefit from its approach to reach consumers directly through the Internet or smartphone apps in the People's Republic.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the sportswear manufacturer's "digital transformation" with strategic investments, thus increasing its competitive advantage.
Lifetime ban on stadium use in Italy over racism
The Brazilian defender Jesus was insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then posted the private messages and called on his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am", wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing for AS Rom since 2016.
The club responded late Thursday by reporting the fan's account to Instagram and the police, and the Roma fan was never allowed to attend a club game again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. We must identify the responsible and throw them out of the stadiums", FIFA president Gianni Infantino said over the weekend.
The Italian authorities have now banned 38 fans of record champion Juventus Turin from entering the stadium. Four of them are banned from entering the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. The rest are banned for four to seven years.
The fans are linked to ongoing investigations into 12 leaders of ultra-fan groups in the Juventus area, who are accused of serious extortion, money laundering and personal violence, among other things.
According to Italian media reports, the Ultra leaders are behind the black market in tickets, "militarily controlling" the fan-tour and blackmailing Juventus staff to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political, whole generations are labeled with catchy terms, and if you look closely, the awards are full of contradictions, so how well do these labels describe the individual lifestyle of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" was the official call for the launch of the crabs hunt at Gaochun's Gucheng Lake on September 21, which also marked the opening ceremony of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee announced.
Gaochun, which forms the southern outskirts of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mix of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields".
The people of Gaochun started crab farming as early as the 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a major industry that provides high income and has become an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively pursued large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as a technology-assisted crab farming.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform of "division of power, optimization of administration and public services" and has carefully built the service network for "permits under one roof, a law enforcement team, a service network, a lending platform" to fully optimize the licensing, service and development environment.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local advantages of connectivity to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, and uses the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a landmark to locate smart high-end manufacturing enterprises, companies in the fields of biomedical and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection, the cultural and health sectors, and organic farming enterprises that are leaders in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national all-region tourism zone and tourism of national importance, which has contributed to the development of the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun countryside, building a building for citizen services and increasing the level of public services, enhancing the energy efficiency of the "tourism" and the quality of tourism, and further developing the "tourism" sector.
Iran-US conflict: Rouhani speaks of ending sanctions - Trump disagrees
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has spoken after returning from the UN General Assembly about a supposed US offer to lift sanctions, and that the US has promised to end all sanctions in return for talks with the Tehran leadership, Rouhani said on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted his Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions against it so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no".
Rouhani described the situation as follows: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were in New York and insisted on a meeting. "And America says I will lift the sanctions", Rouhani added.
However, this move was not done in an acceptable manner, Rouhani criticized, adding that given the sanctions in place and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rouhani in New York, in the hope of saving the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes in a very short time have rocked western Turkey, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the previous day's quake, there have been nearly 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This increases the fear of a disaster.
The government has announced that it will set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future. The government has announced that it will set up a committee to prepare the country for earthquakes.
Turkey has not been adequately prepared for earthquakes in the past 20 years, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.The city itself is constantly ignoring the latent danger.Every year, poorly built residential buildings collapse - among other things, they are made rubble by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly hit Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the renowned architect M√ºcella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces that were listed as safe havens in the center have long since been built in.
The epicenter of Thursday's quake was in the Sea of Marmara, off Silivri, at a depth of about seven kilometers, the Afad disaster management agency said.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu tweeted that there were no reports of injuries or damage at first, while state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of their homes in panic, students being evacuated from buildings in Silivri district for security reasons, and some students crying as seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly earthquake prone. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disturbance, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the 1999 earthquake near Istanbul.
Researchers fear that a 7.1-7.4 magnitude earthquake could hit the country, but it's unclear when the quake will hit.
Companies are developing contingency plans, individuals have so-called go-bags packed with everything they need, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth shakes.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after returning from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was following developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom).
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
Many users on social media are reporting panic, buildings shaking, schools and hospitals evacuated, phone lines cut, and it was even more violent than Tuesday, a user wrote. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned on Twitter of aftershocks, urging people to stay away from buildings that have sustained visible damage.
The official time of the quake is stated as 13:59 local time, and just minutes after the first quake, CNN Turkey reported a aftershock of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Just on Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 earthquake shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt as far as Istanbul - and its epicenter was in the Sea of Marmara, west of the metropolis of millions, the disaster management agency Afad said on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a major earthquake.
Researchers believe that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could strike Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
"These could be the signs of a bigger earthquake", Ersoy told the station. "Sooner or later the big one will come".
The European Parliament has also been asked to take a decision on the future of the European Union, and the European Council has already taken a decision on the future of the European Union.
Parliament: New fuel in the Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair for a possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. The US Democrats are on the way to a possible impeachment process: the complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president provide important clues for investigations against the president. Trump himself once again sees himself as a victim of a "witch hunt". He also doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - pilot diverted
A United Airlines flight was diverted because a passenger was trapped in the onboard toilet, and the toilet door was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said, according to US media.
The woman was finally freed from the narrow cabin after an unplanned landing on Wednesday evening in Denver, US media reported, citing other passengers, who had been trapped there for about an hour.
A video circulated on the Internet, allegedly from US media reporting that Flight 1554, shows several people trying to free the woman. "We're working on opening the door right now, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man. The airline apologized to all passengers.
The Cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it -- and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous short story "The Transformation", the British bestselling author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "The Cockroach" will be published in German on November 27, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who in his former life was ignored or hated, but now suddenly is the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is determined not to let anything or anyone stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "When Parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers shamelessly lie as the Soviet leaders once did, when Brexiteers in high positions are almost begging for the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write". McEwan had just published the novel Machines Like Me about artificial intelligence in the spring.
Kafka's 1915 novel tells the story of Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning to find himself "turned into a huge insect", gradually excluded from family and society, and finally dying. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world upside down", said Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests ‚Ç¨9.5 million in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 wagons in Austria and Hungary will be fitted with whisper brakes to reduce noise pollution from freight trains, and sections of the Graz-Gyor and Wiener Neustadt-Sopron railway lines will be modernised and electrified.
The EU authorities say the project is designed to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, with funding coming from the EU's Connecting Europe Facility.
Thomas Cook: all voyages cancelled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all travel until and including 31 October 2019, a day after filing for bankruptcy, the company said Thursday evening.
The company said it was also concerned with bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, √ñGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which had already been paid or fully paid.
The Commission's proposal to set up a European tourism network in the Netherlands is a step in the right direction.
Insurance company wants to start transferring money to hotels immediately
The European Commission has announced that it will be implementing a new policy on the protection of the environment in the European Union, which will be implemented in the next few years.
Based on the booking information and without the need for separate invoices, hotels in the resorts will now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, a Zurich spokesman for the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travellers are not asked or otherwise forced by these hotels to pay individual hotel bills from now on", said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company was responding to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay for their accommodation on site, some of whom had to pay more than ‚Ç¨1,000, which the German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had sharply criticized.
The Commission has decided to grant a Community guarantee of EUR 100 million to the EIB in the form of a loan for the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the European Union.
The insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
The newly announced payments to hotels by Zurich Insurance will only help travellers who are currently on the road. For Thomas Cook customers who are still planning to fly on holiday, things are looking bad. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all travel until and including October 31 would be cancelled. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid.
The company has announced that it will continue to review the situation with regard to travel starting from 1 November 2019 and that it will continue to review the situation in coordination with the insolvency insurance company.
The company refers to the Zurich insurance company represented by Kaera, which provides information on how to reimburse travel expenses and submit claims via a web form on the Kaera website.
Prince Harry destroys land mine in Angola
Prince Harry has long been a part of Lady Diana's legacy, and in Africa he's following in his mother's footsteps.
Dressed in a blue flak jacket, British Prince Harry detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the village of Dirico, he set off the detonation circuit in front of running TV cameras on Friday morning. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded in the savannah landscape, causing no damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African tour, Harry then set out to follow in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same bombardier who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to retrace the path she took. The images of Princess Diana walking through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She too had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry, 35, and his wife Meghan, 38, began a 10-day trip to Africa on Monday in the South African tourist capital of Cape Town.
Brexit negotiations stalled: the risk of no deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a clear decision: there will be no third postponement of Brexit negotiations with him, that's for sure. But what he says is something that has been said for a long time by the polarizing British. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Britain is like a sword of Damocles hovering over the blonde. His suspension of Parliament to be able to stick to his Brexit policy until the exit date was cancelled earlier this week. And a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend the bilateral talks until October 31 if negotiations with the EU fail. However, Johnson had categorically ruled this out again and again.
Boris Johnson still thinks a deal is possible
But the pressure seems to be on Johnson too, who has since made hints during a hospital visit that he would support extending the negotiations if there is a disagreement until the end of October:
You know, we're gonna follow the law.
But at the same time we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
I'm cautiously optimistic that it will work.
And the time is running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators have about six weeks left to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. But even the recent talks have failed to make a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine at the moment. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a further postponement of the exit date will be in force. The opposition does not trust the Prime Minister's words, however. They fear that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US authorities: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this regard, the US Health Department CDC reported. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there have already been more than 900 cases, about 500 of which have been confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage has been reported so far. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the United States.
Fear of new protests in Egypt grows
The videos of Mohammed Ali, a Spanish-based entrepreneur and actor, have been shared millions of times online, calling for a "people's revolution".He has called for more protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement, on Friday.Ali hopes to hold mass rallies with a million participants in central squares across the country.
The security authorities are alarmed, with police presence already increasing in central Cairo, several subway stations closed, roads around central Tahrir Square blocked, and in recent days police have stepped up their road controls, searching pedestrian phones for messages and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, hundreds of people took part in protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansoura, the first such open protest in Egypt in years, which was met with a correspondingly harsh response from security forces. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said nearly 2,000 people had been arrested since last week, many of them arbitrarily, simply because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW said, citing lawyers.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country, which has led to the government in Cairo blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi.The general has ruled the country since 2013 after toppling democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.Thousands of Islamists, anti-government activists, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partially convicted in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox returns from Greenland expedition
Polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday and was greeted by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had taken climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic in the racing yacht "Malizia", on his arrival in Hamburg harbour.
Fuchs and a team of scientists had spent the past few months on board his sailing ship, the Dagmar Aaen, off the coasts of Iceland and Greenland, studying and documenting the effects of global warming.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar scientist. He has waited years for the younger generation to speak up. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming. Yet many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens at sea is often done behind the scenes", said Fuchs, who and his team wanted to educate people about the effects of global warming and ocean pollution, including using a drone to measure Greenland's glaciers and fishing for microplastics in nets.
For his "struggle for sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans", the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the Seadevcon Maritime Award at the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model", said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades".
Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti and fish in a simple restaurant near the castle of angels in Rome: this seemed too much for two Japanese tourists.
"Such cases damage the reputation of Rome, and we call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud", said a spokesman for Federagit, the association of Rome's tour guides, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The restaurant owner immediately responded. The Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti but also fresh fish, the owner of the restaurant justified. However, this is not shown on the bill. A tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is also normal, the hostess said.
A phone call in Ukraine and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump may actually face impeachment proceedings after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, and the Democrats want to check this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - it's weeks until a decision is made.
The allegation by the whistleblower, who ultimately made the conversation public with his complaint out of concern for national security and U.S. democracy, is monstrous: the president abused his power to manipulate the government of another country to influence the 2020 election, using Ukraine's dependence to blackmail them into acting against a political opponent.
The essence of this plot can be seen in the transcript of the conversation with Zelensky, which has since been published, although it does not give the full text.
The story begins from the public's point of view in May 2019, when the New York Times reported on Rudy Giuliani's plans to travel to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the newly elected President Zelensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We are not interfering in an election, we are interfering in an investigation to which we have a right", he tells the newspaper.
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies focused on Trump's 2016 presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton, who was said by critics at the time to have conspired with Ukrainian actors to create a pretext for the Russia investigation in the United States.
The investigation is about the very investigation that Trump will be talking about so prominently on the phone with Zelensky in July. Giuliani's version and the president's version is that former vice president and now promising Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, as the Obama administration's Ukraine envoy, pressed for the dismissal of then-Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Shokin in order to stop the investigation he was responsible for into the gas company whose board his son Biden served on. Biden senior Hunter had blackmailed Ukraine financially to cover up his family's corrupt schemes.
In fact, the process was a little different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian attorney general leave, the investigation into the gas company was already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. In addition, Shokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt behavior, the US government was far from the only Western partner who pressed for his dismissal. Besides, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation into the company.
Instagram and WhatsApp are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain are the most affected. On the website allest√∂rungen.de, users report that Facebook has been down since about 3:30 p.m. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded.
Instagram and Co. more frequently affected by disruptions
This is not the first major outage this year, as the service was down for several hours in March and July, and as in previous cases, users are turning to Twitter to vent their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the Antarctic ice by the Chilean Air Force. They were traveling in a rubber dinghy and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour was needed by the Chilean rescue helicopter for the rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we got the call, we took off at a little before 10:00, and 20 minutes later we were over the boat".
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there.
Warning: Smartphone is NOT to be charged wirelessly
Practical but Harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently been launched that support wireless charging and are selling very well - above all the new iPhone 11 models - we would like to recall a study from early July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperatures increase battery life
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat generation. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. When wireless charging, however, the researchers have always measured over 30 degrees even with perfect orientation of the smartphone on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is located a little near the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad also rises, which in turn drives up the power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a crucial factor in battery durability. Every single degree plays a role. When charged at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but it also doesn't last as long overall. The lifespan is therefore shorter. The researchers therefore advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery replacement in modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of an battery charger once again - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply put the device on a charging pad - which is now installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without the hassle of cable salad and plugging in the plug.
Everest traffic jam photographer: 13,000 in six months
A Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the world's 14 highest mountains in just six months, Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and set a record, his expedition organizer said.
Purja, a former soldier, wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months, calling his project "Mission Possible". He has made international headlines once before, with a springtime viral photo of climbers standing in line on Mount Everest.
The image of the mass climbing caused a debate about increased security measures on the 8,848-meter-high mountain, the world's highest peak, where 11 climbers died in a matter of days in May.
Purja's climb of the 14th eight-thousandth may be a problem: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet, citing bad weather as one of the reasons.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was a pregnant elephant calf, a police spokesman said Friday. "We suspect the elephants were poisoned".
The four bodies were found in a protected area near the famous and popular tourist site of Sigiriya, where the police said they were believed to be between 15 and 25 years old.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year, often by farmers whose land the animals had previously been harmless to, while about 50 people are killed each year by elephants, mostly when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
In Sri Lanka, only about 7,000 elephants are estimated to be left, and killing them is theoretically punishable by death.
Detained British tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker Stena Impero is leaving the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after it was seized by Iran, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard reported on July 19 after the Iranian Revolutionary Guard detained the British-flagged tanker for allegedly violating maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook management in the critique
The House of Commons' economic committee wants to investigate the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook in detail, including the salary package of its board and the reasons why the British government did not want to give financial support to the struggling company. "Our interest is in the supervision of the company as well as the control of external auditors", said committee chairwoman Rachel Reeves in London. "Obviously we are dealing with a bad example of management greed".
Experts say genes are overestimated in colon cancer risk
The role of genes in the family's increased risk of bowel cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. This is the conclusion reached by researchers at the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a recent study.
Elon Musk is raising Tesla stock
Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's circular said.
The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly, and Tesla needs to provide as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's stock went out of business with a gain of over six percent. The price has not risen this strongly in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well over 95,000 cars, reaching its record high.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This requires six-digit numbers in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
Will the UK government bypass the Brexit Act?
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a lid on whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the latest law passed by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October, which Johnson criticises as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson might try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law, using a procedural trick that would delay the law's entry into force until after the EU leaves.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident of leaving the EU on 31 October and the best way is with an agreement".
Iran is apparently ramping up uranium enrichment.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on European partners in the dispute over the salvation of the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, European states are showing inability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions", Rouhani said at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian atomic bomb, which in return included a commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The United States withdrew from the agreement in 2018 alone to force Iran to change course in its aggressive Middle East policy with "maximum pressure". The administration of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now again imposing harsh sanctions on Tehran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or at least prepared for use the centrifuges installed in early September with uranium.
The European Union is not prepared to accept the US sanctions, but it is prepared to take the necessary steps to ensure that the US sanctions are not imposed on Iran.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the general mood has changed after an attack on a major oil refinery in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and Britain on Monday followed the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence", Rouhani said. European leaders, however, failed to do so in talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they simply cited the fact that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met in recent days with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before any talks with US President Trump, Rouhani demanded that the US administration's far-reaching sanctions be lifted, and urged the government in Washington to shift to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet from another star crosses the solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from deep space, a first for the comet, which allows for inferences about other solar systems.
What was initially a conjecture has now been confirmed: an interstellar guest is crossing our solar system. The comet from the depths of space, named 2I/Borisov after its discoverer, has captured the interest of astronomers around the world.
The most distant comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - using a self-made telescope 65 centimeters in diameter.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object spotted during a transit of our solar system, after 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers a rare chance to get close-up views of an alien solar system before it disappears forever. Early observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those in our own system, reported the Canary Islands Institute of Astrophysics. "The comet's current speed is high, about 90,000 miles per hour, well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the sun at this distance", said Davide Nasa Farnocchia of the U.S. Space Agency in a statement.
The comet is on a so-called hyperbolic orbit, which leads it out of our solar system, according to the analysis, and is clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for naming and categorizing celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was initially listed under the catalog number C/2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are in luck: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted on approach, leaving researchers many months to study it. "The object will reach its maximum brightness in mid-December and will be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020", Farnocchia explained. "After that, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".
Several observatories have already been targeting the visitor, and a team led by Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined in a preliminary study the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers.
Researchers at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar", said IAC researcher Julia de Le√≥n.
The IAU's assessment is that the discovery of two interstellar visitors in just two years suggests that these objects could open a new path to exploring certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how frequent such spike visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency ESA.
The agency plans to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (comet-interceptor) at a waiting position 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 2028, to look for either an untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system or an interstellar visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua, according to ESA's science director G√ºnther Hasinger.
First landing at Beijing's new Daxing mega airport
Just before the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic, the first passenger flight of China United Airlines has landed at the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for the captain and crew.
The new airport is expected to handle about 45 million passengers annually by 2022, and by 2025 it will be 72 million. Chinese President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion dollar project.
The complex has four runways, which will be expanded to seven later, and is equipped with the world's largest automated air traffic management system.
Even during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 - and is much smaller - has been postponed again and again.
New supersonic plane to fly in 2030: London to Sydney in four and a half hours
The UK Space Agency is dreaming of flying from London to Sydney in just four and a half hours. "This is the technology that could definitely do it", CNN quoted the agency as saying. "We're talking about the 2030s for launch, and the work is already very advanced".
The British Space Agency (BSA) is working closely with the Australian Space Agency to advance the project. A flight from the British capital to the Australian capital currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic passenger aircraft to date, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until its retirement in 2003, taking three to three and a half hours.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transportation", Reaction Engines says on its website, adding that the Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at speeds of Mach 5 - five times faster than sound - and that such aircraft could be used outside the Earth's atmosphere, making possible "the next generation of truly reusable frames".
Trump wants to track down anonymous Ukrainian informants
In the Ukraine affair over the possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information", Trump told staff at the U.S. Embassy to the United Nations in New York on Thursday, saying the person was almost "a spy" and that such people were treated "a little differently" in the past than they are today.
The event was not actually public, but several US media outlets broadcast audio clips of the speech on Friday, prompting outrage among Democrats.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives announced Tuesday that they were preparing to impeach Trump, based on a written complaint by an anonymous intelligence official who has made serious accusations against Trump and his administration.
As part of his work, the whistleblower claims to have received information from several government officials that the US president is "using the power of his office" to get another country to interfere in the US election in 2020 in his favor.
The allegations center on a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in late July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate what might harm his political rival Joe Biden, including past business dealings of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukrainian justice.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of covering up the Ukraine phone call: leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the covers. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been made. This had been removed from a customary database after the conversation, but on the instructions of lawyers from the White House, and instead stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough record of the conversation has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known, but the New York Times reported that he was an employee of the CIA.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday, writing in a series of tweets that the "so-called whistleblower" had spread second-hand information that turned out to be false, so there may not be any informants or spies.
Trump's comments in New York about those who allegedly leaked information to the whistleblower sparked outrage, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reacting with concern and complaining that Trump's statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
Various investigations against Trump and his entourage have been underway for months in various committees in the House of Representatives. In light of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pushing ahead with new vigor in order to launch a possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.
"The whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation", said the head of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. Trump sharply attacked Schiff, accusing him of misrepresenting things and again demanding the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insults Schiff and had already demanded his resignation months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government security and foreign policy officials, most of whom worked under Democratic and Republican presidents, backed a statement released Friday that the Democrats are investigating a possible impeachment case, which, if proven true, would be "a ruthless abuse of power" by Trump, it said.
There is no exact timetable for the next procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment process. The decision on an actual impeachment would fall in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The chances of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment process.
VW works council: jobs are being cut "creepingly"
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce production costs could come at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the works council of the carmaker. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros from ten billion euros by 2023. Of this, 500 million euros are to be saved already this year.
The key to this is personnel costs. The "future pact" negotiated between companies and works councils in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020.
As our newspaper has now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production which are not actually available are being "creeping" off by another route - bypassing the official course.
The works council had no way of forcing the re-employment in these cases. Meanwhile, there was a shortage of staff in many places, the workload was increasing, and the concern about a gradual exhaustion of the vehicle factories was growing. This also raised fears that car production could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is more favourable in other parts of the world.
The VW brand wants to further standardize production worldwide and centrally control new projects. This also aims to reduce costs and also speed up decisions - the goal behind this is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production manager Andreas Tostmann said at a management conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the looming trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof".
The company has already achieved successes in this area: for example, this year, for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg plant is the only VW plant where vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants produce components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb is that 800,000 cars must be built annually for the plant to be satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the occupancy in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining demand for diesel and the problems in the transition to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust gas testing procedure.
As production manager Tostmann announced last year, however, Wolfsburg is to roll off the production line "with a view to" one million cars, which will make it possible to pool Golf production at the main plant - because the Zwickau plant will be moving off the production line to produce electric cars.
The company also produces the Tiguan and Tarraco SUVs (Seat). However, the sales of the Golf and Tiguan have been declining recently.
Voodoo forced into prostitution: Trafficking convicted
Young Nigerian women have been cursed, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six suspected traffickers have been jailed.
Six alleged traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and prison terms of up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday for trafficking young Nigerian women into the Ruhr area and forcing them into prostitution.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were taken across the Mediterranean in tubes by Libyan smugglers. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. Upon arrival in Germany, they were distributed to different brothels to process the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25 000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - admitted at trial to having the young Nigerian women taken into brothels and then distributed to them. "The work was physically and mentally difficult for the women", said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the sentencing.
The convictions relate to commercial and gang smuggling of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and serious forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In a continuing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendants' union UFO has again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "inform on 14 October about the labour strike measures in the LH group", Ufo's chief executive Daniel Flohr said on Friday.
The company has confirmed the decision and is considering whether to appeal. "I think it is unlikely that a second court will see the matter completely differently", Flohr said.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Frankfurt Labour Court for a judicial review of the Ufo's status as a trade union, arguing that the union had not had a board of directors for months and was therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective partner.
The first was a fierce leadership dispute in the Sparta union, which saw many members of the board and advisory board resign, including the longtime union leader Nicoley Baublies.
Saudi Arabia announces new visa system for easier entry
Saudi Arabia has not been known as a magnet for international tourists until now, but that is about to change as the Persian Gulf country plans to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia intends to attract more international tourists, with the aim of increasing the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year by 2030, the tourism commission said.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country", said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia has been difficult to reach for tourists, with visas usually only being granted for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visits with family in the desert state.The new rules are aimed at increasing revenue from tourism, which the conservative kingdom says will reduce its dependence on oil.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones hit two of the most important oilfields in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oilfield.As a result, national oil production plummeted sharply, oil prices soared.It is expected to take several weeks for the kingdom's oil production to return to its previous levels.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in the middle of a wedding reception.
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding.The model posted several party photos in her Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time) showing her in a white wedding dress.Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles, according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits printed with bananas on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding".
The Biebers signed off on a big party at the New York City land registry a year ago.
In a recent interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey explained that after initial problems, the two had found a common ground: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship".
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people have died in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic, the wreckage of which was discovered on Friday in a forest near the city of Mecin, police said.
The authorities had been searching for the plane since Thursday evening after the crew had given an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also involved in the search. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of Europe's tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also threatening, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) reported Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of these are found on no other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of threat and thus on the verge of extinction.
The IUCN classifies endangered species into six categories: "potentially endangered", "endangered", "critically endangered", "threatened with extinction", and "extinct in the wild" to "extinct".
Eberish and wild chestnut threatened
In Germany, the eberses (sorbuses) are especially at risk, said one of the authors, David Allen, of Deutsche Presse Agency. "Most are at risk because of the small populations they already have or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
The IUCN estimates the number of wild chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000 specimens. The trees in cities, parks and alleys are not taken into account in this assessment.
Bush and moose species also at risk
The IUCN scientists also created new European Red Lists of molluscs, shrubs and moose. More than a fifth of molluscs and moose and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of wildlife, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet", said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europe Office.
Earthquake near Istanbul: 34 injured reported
The latest earthquake in Turkey has injured 34 people, reportedly leaving dozens homeless, and forced 14 schools in Istanbul to close for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged, and there were nearly 200 aftershocks since the quake struck the day before, which hit the Marmara region outside Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the metropolis of millions.
The government now wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
Istanbul is considered particularly earthquake prone, and a section of the so-called North Anatolian fault line, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates, lies beneath the Sea of Marmara.
One of the most severe earthquakes was a magnitude 7.6 earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul, with its epicenter in G√∂lc√ºk, southeast of Istanbul, killing more than 17,000 people.
Already on Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 earthquake had shaken the region around Istanbul, and authorities urged residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the halftime show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will be hosting the halftime show of the next American football Super Bowl final. The singers announced this on Twitter. "It won't get any bigger", Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is insanely excited to be on the Super Bowl stage.
Jennifer Lopez said she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - when she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky during the halftime show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina". She can't wait to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world".
Shakira said in a statement that she feels honored to be standing alongside another artist on one of the world's biggest stages, representing Latinos from the U.S. and around the world. "And then on my birthday!" the main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, saying it was the first time the two "queens" had ever been on stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fighting against falling viewership
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the halftime show are among the most-watched TV broadcasts in the United States. Even though the audience numbers have recently dropped: This February, the show attracted the fewest viewers in the United States in more than a decade. Despite this, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
The Super Bowl halftime show was preceded by a riot: in February, media reports said that top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform in the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had kneeled during the 2016/17 NFL season before NFL games during the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick sparked a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump sharply attacked the mostly African-American football stars. Kaepernick himself is without a club since March 2017 and has not contested an NFL game.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press release, the collapse of travel company Thomas Cook is likely to cost some banks a lot of money, including Credit Suisse, which is facing a high-risk write-down of its outstanding loans, reports the Financial Times.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse would likely have to write off up to 1.8 billion pounds (about 2 billion euros) in total, according to the report, according to estimates by the consulting firm AlixPartners.
Borrowers would have to accept write-downs of ¬£900 million to ¬£1 billion and lenders between ¬£550 million and ¬£825 million, and the actual amounts to be written off would be more likely to be at the upper end of the range, one expert told the paper.
The Commission's proposal to set up a European Banking Authority (EBA) to monitor the implementation of the European Banking Authority's (EBA) financial statements and to monitor the implementation of the European Banking Authority's (EBA) financial statements, which are published in the Official Journal of the European Union (the 'European Central Bank'), is a step in the right direction.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected killers to Italy
Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who were alleged to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule that out, but we have no reliable information about it", Sea Watch refugee spokesman Ruben Neugebauer told dpa news agency.
The three men were identified by other migrants in Italy, who are accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya, and were arrested in a reception centre in Messina, Italy.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the EU's financial interests are protected by the EU's financial contribution to the fight against fraud and corruption.
US warns German government against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting the Chinese network provider Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great", Pai told the "Handelsblatt" with a view to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
The Commission has also received information from the Chinese authorities that the Chinese authorities have not yet issued a security clearance certificate.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties of such requests", the FCC chief continued, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The German Government has now agreed to require suppliers to provide a 'declaration of confidence'.
Berlin will first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the Handelsblatt reports, citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible, because 5G technology is not just hardware:
The software is the key to keeping the equipment up to date, and it's made up of billions of lines of program code that changes over time", Pai said.
It is "very hard to imagine" that a government agency, "anywhere, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks", the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of having close ties to the Chinese state apparatus:
The company's ownership is not transparent, and the employee company that supposedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government", Pai told the trade paper.
The US has been presented with evidence that government employees are placed inside the company.
Chemical plant in northern France burns: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions, a gigantic firewall lights up the sky over a chemical plant in northern France, and the fire is extinguished after hours - but the cleanup could now take days.
Schools and nurseries remain closed in the region after a fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open on Friday as a precaution, the competent prefecture announced. The Interior Ministry had asked citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not expose themselves to smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals inside, protect their feed and stop the harvest for now.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, the prefecture said, adding that there was still a risk of the smell spreading after it was extinguished, according to the prefecture on Twitter.
A giant black plume of smoke had risen from the chemical plant earlier, and French media reported huge flames and explosions at the Lubrizol plant, which produces additives for oils, a few kilometers from the city center.
The factory in Normandy is classified as a Seveso hazardous site under special surveillance, according to authorities, following a devastating chemical accident in Seveso, Italy, near Milan, in 1976.
The prefect of Normandy, Pierre-Andr√© Durand, told the BFMTV news station that "high toxicity" had not been found in samples, but that pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out.
The fire broke out at about 2:40 a.m. in the early morning, authorities said, although the cause was not immediately clear.
French finance minister: 'Germany must invest now'
French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better", Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We cannot wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions".
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
France has no such scope, the minister added, pointing to the country's high public debt, which is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product and must be "stabilized" and "reduced", Le Maire said.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investment to revive the European economy, in return for which German politicians have repeatedly called on France to tackle its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax breaks of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government is responding to the protests of the yellow vest movement, and is expected to reduce the new debt to 2.2 percent from the expected 3.1 percent this year.
Johnson evades question about Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticizes the "Capitulation Act" passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British prime minister to avoid a chaotic Brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a lid on whether he wants to impose an unregulated Brexit - despite the latest law passed by Parliament to prevent this from happening.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October, which Johnson criticises as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson might try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that would postpone the law's entry into force until after the EU leaves. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident of leaving the EU on October 31st, and the best way is with an agreement".
Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said he saw the political debate over Brexit as a "walk in the park" and expressed confidence that the planned EU exit would still happen: "We're enjoying it, we're going to win, we're going to leave, no worries", Cummings said at a book launch, according to the British newspaper Telegraph.
Cummings, who led the Vote Leave Brexit campaign during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, is now the chief strategist at the British government's Downing Street headquarters, and is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has put the prime minister in a near-impossible situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin -- they were all in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers of all time. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda from 1969 until her death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the picture book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from before Instagram, a celebration of Linda McCartney's legacy as a committed artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film".
Linda McCartney, who studied art history at Aizona University before she discovered photography, always had her camera with her, and she took thousands of Polaroids, a few hundred of which are now being published for the first time in The Polaroid Diaries.
The exhibition includes portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments", writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword.
He dances on his shoulders with his daughter Mary, he talks on the phone in a bathing suit with a bag on his head, or he wears shabby moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also led a very normal life beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or Scotland.
Like almost no other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment, and Linda McCartney's recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo is happening in front of you. And then you have to snap it at the exact right moment", Paul McCartney said. "If you snap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo". And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing the exact right moment. "She just knew she had it", Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The lighting, the composition, the cut and the colours are all right, which makes The Polaroid Diaries not only a fun picture book for Beatles fans, but also an anecdotal and aesthetically pleasing one, where landscapes can sometimes seem like abstract paintings, the perfect complement to the newly re-released Beatles album Abbey Road, which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from its neighbor despite US sanctions against Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop importing oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there", Erdogan said in New York, where he was attending the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey has problems importing Iranian oil because some companies have "withdrawn because of the US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and many others", said the Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic since it withdrew from the international nuclear agreement with Iran.
The sanctions have led to a drop in Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran.
The U.S. government wants to limit the number of refugees it takes in.
The U.S. government wants to drastically limit the number of refugees it can accept. The U.S. State Department said Thursday that the annual limit for a resettlement program would be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, a 40 percent cut.
The State Department said that while the United States remains committed to helping refugees, its primary mission is to protect and serve U.S. citizens, and that the U.S. immigration system is currently overwhelmed.
The U.S. government will focus on two groups of refugees in the future: people persecuted for their faith and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and have been put in danger, according to the State Department statement.
The program, which began in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the United States. The cap of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 fiscal year would be the lowest in the program's history. The current cap of 30,000 is already a low. When the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was just under 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted with horror to the announced reduction in the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America", said David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, adding that the United States would further undermine its leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the United States, legal and illegal, and the U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming fiscal year, according to its own figures. These numbers are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Going near a rat"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage. Whoever provided the information to the informant accusing him of abuse of power "is close to a mole", Trump said, according to a recording of a private event in New York on Thursday. Several US media reports concur.
So Trump was speaking to staff at the U.S. mission to the United Nations. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, "That's close to a rat". Then Trump added, "You know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right. The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now".
Observers have described the latter as a possible reference to the death penalty, while Democrats have sharply criticized Trump's remarks, accusing him of intimidating witnesses and trying to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment case against him, the chairs of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees wrote.
The whistleblower accuses the president of abusing his office to solicit interference by another country in the 2020 US election, in a complaint that has now been published. Specifically, it concerns his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyy in the summer: In the conversation, Trump suggested that he launch investigations against his potential Democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.
It is not yet clear who the whistleblower is, but the New York Times reports that the whistleblower is an analyst for the CIA.
Baby and toddler drown in Aegean Sea
The European Union has also been involved in a number of high-profile cases involving migrants from Turkey and Greece, including the death of seven migrants, including five children, in the sinking of a rubber dinghy.
Seven migrants died when a rubber dinghy sank off the Greek island of Chios, including a baby and four other children, the Greek coastguard said. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floodwaters by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is a smuggler, local news portal Alithia.gr reported. The migrants left Turkey in the morning, trying to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of Chios, which lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
The migrants are currently crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean Sea, mostly in small boats, where 174 people died last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The Who are cancelling.
A US rock band The Who concert came to an abrupt end due to an illness of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to function. At the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should stop while it's still playing".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized, adding that Daltrey "can't really talk right now". Townsend promised the audience that he would come to a compensation concert at his expense.
The Who have cancelled shows scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, but will be joined by 75-year-old Daltrey and 74-year-old Townsend, the only remaining founding members.
WeWork is shaking up the housing market
In New York, WeWork has risen to become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork has grown from a small startup to a driving force in the world's most expensive real estate markets, but now the company is in crisis, with landlords fearful of billions in revenue.
The crisis of office leasing company WeWork threatens to upset the balance in the world's largest real estate markets. The company had recently sacked founder Adam Neumann as CEO, postponed its planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the executive jet to gain financial space for the coming weeks and months.
WeWork leases large office spaces on a long-term basis and rents them out to members on a short-term basis, in small units. These can be individual freelancers, small start-ups, or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has been burning money at a breathtaking rate with this business. Last year, the company posted a loss of $1.6 billion, with a turnover of $1.8 billion. This year alone, rental costs due to the leasing of ever-greater spaces are estimated to have risen to $2.5 billion. To limit the loss, the new company management is now said to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped renting new spaces with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now signed leases for up to 15 years, resulting in liabilities of more than $40 billion, a huge liability that could pose a problem not only to the company and its investors but to entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork has rented nearly 300,000 square feet of office space in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months. WeWork's new contracts alone have ensured that demand for office space in New York has been greater than the new space that has come onto the market during that time.
The UK capital could also see a noticeable shift in the real estate market without further expansion by the aggressive startup, which is among the main tenants of WeWork, an office building in the centre of the financial capital bought by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost ‚Ç¨100 million last year.
Many landlords have converted their properties to meet WeWork's requirements with high investment. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners will probably have to write off part of the expected billions of revenues. They do not have access to WeWork's - already scarce - reserves despite the long-term lease agreements. Because the rental of WeWork's individual locations is usually done by each specially established subsidiaries, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only narrowly liable.
Russia again detained numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian coast guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen, and in recent days a total of 262 other poachers have been arrested for illegal fishing in the waters, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) told Interfax on Friday.
The Commission has also been asked to take a decision on the application of the principle of subsidiarity, which is the basis for the adoption of the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses.
The North Korean fishermen were in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian coastguard is conducting patrols to protect its marine biological resources, according to the agency Ria Novosti.
The Russian fisheries authority had not issued fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently complained about the environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who used narrow-mesh synthetic nets, which are banned in Russia, to catch small creatures from the sea, and simply dumped the nets into the sea, where they would take 200 years to decompose, and the ships themselves did not meet the hygienic and technical requirements.
The arrest of three members of the Russian coast guard was reported by Moscow the week before, and a North Korean man who was also wounded died later from his injuries, according to the FSB.
The United States has imposed a travel ban on former President Castro.
The US has imposed travel bans on former Cuban President Ra√∫l Castro and his children, the US State Department said in a statement on Thursday, citing Castro's involvement in "grave human rights violations".
"The Cuban regime's disregard for human rights and use of force to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela", US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued travel bans against members of the Venezuelan government and military, among others. Venezuela has been in a bitter power struggle for months between the government and the opposition. The United States has imposed a series of sanctions on Maduro's government to bring him to his knees and help put opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaid√≥ in power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro's closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of doctors sent there.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protest to date, thousands of people are once again taking to the streets today to demand more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is planning to hold another round of action and demonstrations in dozens of countries around the world. The time shift is expected to start in New Zealand and Australia before the protests spread across Europe to North America.
"Last Friday, over four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we're going to do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6,383 strikes in 170 countries, she added.
The movement's list of cities where demonstrations are planned includes at least 65 cities, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also smaller towns and cities such as J√ºchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, where people want to take to the streets for the climate.
Thunberg, then aged 15, stood in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to urge Swedish politicians to make a greater commitment to climate protection, which soon gave rise to the Fridays-for-Future movement.
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the EU's role in the fight against climate change, which calls for the EU to take a more active role in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate catastrophe.
Thunberg had arrived in New York City on a high-sea racing yacht less than a month after a two-week transatlantic crossing, where she had last attended climate protests and United Nations summits. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, speaking to the heads of state and government of the world in a heartfelt way. In her home city of Stockholm, she was awarded the Right Livelihood Foundation's Alternative Nobel Prize on Wednesday for her work for more climate protection.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. This includes a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking", a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergencies said on Thursday in Moscow, according to Tass news agency.
The Ministry of Health has banned the use of candles, and it is no longer allowed to grill meat on the balcony.
Cybercriminals hit hard - Investigators remove servers
In the fight against Internet crime, German investigators have for the first time identified a major server provider for illegal business on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites, as the operators of a data centre in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, through which internationally active criminals carried out their activities.
The public prosecutor's office in Koblenz announced that seven suspects were arrested Thursday evening during a major operation.
The suspects' clients include the operators of the world's second largest darknet marketplace for drugs, Wall Street Market, which investigators broke down in the spring.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the sites which are eligible for the scheme.
The access operation, which was supported by special units such as GSG9, involved searches in Germany and neighboring countries, and was the result of nearly five years of investigation.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protest to date, thousands of people are once again taking to the streets today to demand more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller towns and cities such as J√ºchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protests  Who are Thunberg's people?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoking factories that are warming the climate. Even more amazing is that a 16-year-old girl in particular is holding the mirror up to the powerful of the day. But what is behind it? Is it the helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Is it a historic masterpiece or a manipulative tactic for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg is mobilizing the masses and getting young people to stand up for a better climate-friendly world. It is not the first time in Europe that a young person has managed to win over a crowd of children and young people. In 1212, a child named Nicholas from Cologne felt chosen to advocate for a more just world. At that time, he also managed to win over a crowd of young people and persuade them to cross the sea to get to the promised land, similar to how Greta Thunberg recently made the trip to America by sailboat.
But there's a downside to this. Why do we need a campaign called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has wealthy PR managers on her side. By the way, her mother published a book that has sold well thanks to her daughter in the spotlight. Even longtime followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the boat trip was probably too thick for some followers. This is not unfounded either, because the campaign was very well received in the media worldwide and it is making a lot of money thanks to the impressive campaign.
Here the spirits are divided: Is it morally right to get rich financially while saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world-saving operation? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflective point of view is always more important in a democratic society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question even seemingly pious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: interstellar guest crossing our solar system
An alien comet is currently crossing our solar system.
Astronomers' predictions have been confirmed: A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system - only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, researchers have only suspected it, but now they are certain: A comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in the Crimea
The object was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov in Crimea. He looked up at the sky with a telescope he built himself, and further observations confirmed his initial suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that has been spotted during the passage.
The great opportunity for astronomers now is to get a close look at an alien solar system. Apparently, the comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. The comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic path that takes it out of our system, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC).
Comet was spotted before approaching - and can be observed for several months
But before that, astronomers can observe it in detail, because unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted on approach, which means it can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach its maximum brightness in mid-December and will be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020", explains Davide Farnocchia of NASA. "After that, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".
The previous owner of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 'Oumuamua'.
The first findings about comet 2I/Borisov give scientists hope
The first findings suggest that the comet is between 2 and 16 kilometres in diameter, but at the same time it appears to be similar to our comet, because, as IAC researcher Julia de Le√≥n says, the comet's spectrum is similar to ours.
The discovery of two such objects in just two years may open up a new avenue for studying certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids keep the researchers busy, and recently a giant asteroid hurtled past the earth and came dangerously close.
Rachel Johnson appalled by brother's death
Boris Johnson is becoming more lonely, his younger brother leaving the cabinet, his sister lashing out at the prime minister's bellicose language as "unpleasant".
"Surrender", "fraud", "treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is getting more and more prepared - at least verbally.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother uses words like capitulation as if opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, dragged, quartered, tarred and feathered". She finds this extremely reprehensible. She does not recognize her brother's version, said Rachel Johnson, who ran for the EU parliamentary election for the anti-Brexit party Change UK.
She was particularly struck by her brother Jo Cox's mention of an EU-friendly MP who was murdered by a neo-Nazi just days before the 2016 Brexit referendum. Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons that the best way to honour her memory was to push through Brexit. "It is very tasteless to refer to a MP who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first,'" Johnson's sister now criticised.
Cox's widow also sharply criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick when Jos' name is used like that", he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to stand passionately and decisively for what you believe in - no matter what your views are. But never "demonize the other side". He also lamented that an atmosphere had developed in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and as Tory MP. "I have been torn between loyalty to my family and the national interest in recent months - it is an intractable tension", Johnson said.
Johnson's language has also come under sharp criticism in the church, with all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England, as reported by The Times, criticizing language as "not worthy of this country".
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez performing at the Super Bowl
The NFL is sending a strong signal in its 100th year, with two women of Latin American descent performing in the Super Bowl halftime show, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will be hosting the halftime show at the upcoming NFL finals, organizers announced Thursday.
"I feel incredibly honored and humbled to be representing the Latino community alongside JLo because they have incredible strength in the United States", Shakira said in a video.
The American Football League's 100th anniversary final will be held on February 2 in Miami, Florida, a city with many Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") is from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican descent.
"I love that the Super Bowl is bringing two women on stage this time - and two Latinas", Lopez said, sending an important message to all Americans and the world, promising "an explosion of fun and energy" for the show.
Lopez was born in New York City, after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud", and later released songs in Spanish.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a telenovela star and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the United States every time. This year, many also see the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest sporting event in the United States and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyonc√©, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a stir there. The NFL final is usually watched by well over 100 million television viewers, and it is also now extremely popular in Germany.
Last year, the event was preceded by political controversy over quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who refused to stand up during the playing of the national anthem in protest against police violence against blacks and was harshly attacked by US President Donald Trump.
An actor and YouTuber accuses Egypt's ruler of saying that for now, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have the power to influence whether blood will flow on Egypt's streets again have both spent the past week abroad. One of them was floating back at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former general who deposed the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state, in 2013 had a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump praised Sisi's policies against Islam and did not miss a word about human rights abuses on the Nile - in a week in which Egyptian forces had detained hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president. "There is no reason to be alarmed", Sisi said on the plane's microphone, "The Egyptian government has not lost its security".
The president believes that the other man who is currently in charge of the streets is trying to mislead the public. Mohamed Ali has remained abroad, avoiding the security forces who would arrest him if he tried to enter Egypt. A few weeks ago, the 45-year-old actor was known only to a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the voice that dominates political discourse in the country's cafes, living rooms and teahouses: with his YouTube channel "Mohammed's Secrets", Ali calls on his countrymen to rise up against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in a rather rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president revels in luxury and lets himself be built magnificent new palaces, it says. The army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he has been doing business with these very gentlemen for 15 years in his second career as a contractor, he seems to know pretty well what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the clicks are about to explode show.
After thousands demonstrated against Sisi's rule for the first time since he took power last week, and nearly 2,000 citizens, including prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "million-person march" on Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would really take to the streets. But there were isolated smaller protests, for example in Giseh, Cairo, and in a village near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests in which participants accused Sisi of corruption and demanded his resignation.
In Cairo, several metro stations in the city centre were closed for "maintenance work", most roads around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked, and in Rabaa Square, where supporters of the ousted Muslim Brotherhood Mursi took refuge in 2013 until the army opened fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure to prevent protesters from gathering was the Zukunis party, which wanted to hold a large presidential pardon ceremony for Sisulu.
These measures prompted Mohamed Ali to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square", Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not clash with police officers".
If the provider promises too much
If the Internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options.
The Internet contract does not require blind trust in the speed data provided by the providers, but customers can check for themselves how much of the speed is actually achieved if there are any anomalies.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the measure is compatible with the internal market.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options: the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
'However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to supplier-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated', the Bavarian Consumer Centre notes on its website.
If the connection is significantly slower than advertised, customers may set the provider a reasonable period of time, usually 14 days, to deliver the promised service, preferably in writing by letter of objection.
If repeated requests fail, customers can quit and possibly claim damages, but if they fail, only a lawsuit will help.
First senior Republican to investigate
"I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it goes from here is determined by the facts that are established", Phil Scott said at a news conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the whistleblower case before action was taken - an impeachment process can lead to the removal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump repeatedly called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine because Trump has been watching Biden "for years".
Republicans have so far held back from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have expressed discomfort over it. Scott's comments are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already repeatedly spoken out against Trump's policies, such as the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: Another Marvel movie planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it was announced that Sony and Marvel would go their separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man will receive after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home" another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).
Screenrant magazine quotes Marvel boss Kevin Feige as saying, "I'm excited that Spidey's journey in the MCU is continuing. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are excited to continue working on it... He's the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse.
But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony Marvel is said to have made an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney corporation, which also includes Marvel, would share 30 percent of the revenue from upcoming Spider-Man movies. The news is not confirmed, however.
This is how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale.
After nine seasons, the US series "Suits" has now reached the grand finale. The final episode featured many happy endings and as many cameo appearances. The royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who starred in the series for many years, were also charmingly honored.
First off, Duchess Meghan did not return for a final farewell as Rachel Zane in the finale, at least not for new scenes, but instead some flashbacks showed the most memorable scenes with the current Duchess, such as the moments of the failed and successful marriage with Mike or how she greets him after his prison sentence is served.
However, her real husband, Prince Harry, is also mentioned in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) steps to the altar to marry his fianc√©e Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a telling remark about the suit.
Aegean Sea: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned in the Aegean Sea when a boat capsized, killing seven people, the Greek coastguard said on Friday.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants are currently crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean Sea, where 174 people died last year, according to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR).
The European Union has also been a major donor to the fight against terrorism, and has been a key partner in the fight against terrorism.
A spokeswoman for the EU Commission confirmed on Friday that Seehofer was scheduled to travel with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
The Greek government has announced that 654 migrants from Turkey have crossed into Greece on Tuesday alone, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The recent increase in numbers has raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement signed in 2016, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who illegally enter the Greek islands via Turkey, in return for which the EU wanted to take in one Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian deported.
The Greek authorities are struggling to process asylum applications because of a shortage of staff, with some 29,400 people waiting on Lesvos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection.
Never since the EU-Turkey refugee pact came into force in March 2016 have there been so many, state radio reported.
Climate change: Heat increases heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate change is "quite certainly" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Society of Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system was affected by high temperatures and large temperature jumps within a short time and led to an increase in heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics were affected.
Green politician must answer for embarrassing photo booth
The leader of the Canadian Green Party, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Party leader is pictured holding a disposable cup, but now it's come out that the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa, Canada - It went unnoticed for quite a while - and finally caught on. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw was never held by Elizabeth May, the leader of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website, she was seen in a photo with the cup, talking to citizens. However, the photo had already been published and circulated to the media - and the cup was still a snot cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green leader must answer for photo-crash
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and the party of producing fake news to make itself more credible on the issue of "environmental protection", and this in the midst of a campaign for the House of Commons election in which Trudeau is also increasingly struggling over a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked a discussion about fake news, with one user sharing a contrast between the photos, writing: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairman to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and claimed on her blog that she had no knowledge of this action. To emphasize this, she immediately posted the original: she, speaking to citizens, holding a cup. However, she correctly stated that it was made of bamboo. She always had it with her. A spokeswoman for the party said that it was only to accommodate the party logo in the picture, and not to hide something. Only a snippet of the photo is still visible on the website.
May writes that she feels sorry for the employee who did it. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide", she tells the Guardian, and she asks her over-committed team: "If you ever want to edit a picture again, could you do something with my face to make me look younger?"
The German Greens have also been in shitstorms for their use of single-use plastic or for flying - but their pictures were not photoshopped.
Influencer wants free upgrade: lifetime ban on Cathay
It was reported that Jaqueline Ng had been promised an upgrade by Cathay Pacific via email, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was denied boarding - and she will never fly with Cathay again.
Sometimes they get lucky, and the staff at the check-in desk offers a free transfer from economy class.
This case, however, shows how not to do it: a self-proclaimed influencer actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng has more than 65,000 followers.
On the flight home, Jaqueline was denied an upgrade by the staff, despite presenting an email in which her Cathay Pacific was allegedly promising an upgrade.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to upgrade to the long-haul flight, and this time the woman reportedly showed the same email, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK Airport were skeptical, so they checked with the headquarters. In fact, the employee who allegedly sent the email denied that he had emailed Jaqueline, which was confirmed by the email system, which did not show the messages.
The airline staff at the airport cancelled Jaqueline's ticket and banned her from flying with Cathay Pacific for life, forcing her to buy a new ticket to Taiwan for $1,400.
In her case, the influencer approached Elliot Advocacy, a consumer advocacy firm, because while Cathay had reimbursed her for her original ticket, Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But until Jaqueline submits the metadata of the email, the case remains clear: Cathay believes the influencer committed fraud, she will be banned from future flights, and the airline's terms and conditions state that she will not have to pay for the new flight.
Oil prices fall after report on ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in record time on Friday afternoon. Last week, a barrel of North Sea Brent was $61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price of a barrel of American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell 1.3 percent to $55.77.
The price slide was triggered by a Wall Street Journal report on a ceasefire in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia has agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia had brought five percent of global oil production to a standstill in mid-September. The Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen, a country in civil war, had claimed responsibility for the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, the focus could be on growth and demand management, said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, to Bloomberg.
The price of oil continues its downward movement of the past few days. A week ago, WTI oil was still up to almost 59 dollars a barrel, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Bloomberg recently reported, citing insiders, that after the attack in mid-September, repairs to oil facilities in Saudi Arabia are moving faster than expected, with production reaching eight million barrels a day and moving back toward the original volume.
Recently, there have been several press reports citing insiders reporting rapid progress by state oil company Saudi Aramco in repairs, but raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was a hint of a relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker Stena Impero is on its way out of the port more than two months after being seized by Iran and recently cleared.
However, the US announced that it would move its missile defense and troops to Saudi Arabia, Iran's arch-enemy, as fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and UK had temporarily pushed up oil prices in recent weeks.
Trump's accusations are escalating
In the case of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, cover-up allegations have been made against the White House. Several senior government officials have reportedly made an intense effort to prevent access to the transcript of the conversation following a contentious phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky at the end of July, an anonymous informant said. The speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "cover-up". Trump spoke of a "hunting party".
North Korea considers Trump and Kim's third summit questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that a third summit between Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon take place in the nuclear dispute, with the meaning and prospects of such a meeting being questioned due to the lack of progress in implementing agreements reached at the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to KCNA.
The US has so far done nothing to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the North Korean Foreign Ministry adviser, who also criticized the tightening of US sanctions and the joint US-South Korean military exercises, but hoped for a "wise" and "courageous" decision by Trump to bring about a rapprochement.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before he prepared to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, the two met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the talks, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers to help clear mines
Dressed in a blue flak jacket, British Prince Harry symbolically detonated and destroyed a landmine in Angola. He set up the detonation circuit near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the village of Dirico. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later called on running TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who have not helped in clearing the way, to commit to help".
Pound under pressure - interest rate cuts expected
The British pound under pressure
The pound loses value against the euro in the face of an imminent fall in interest rates.
Speculation that the Bank of England (BoE) will soon cut interest rates is putting the pound sterling at a disadvantage, as the British currency plunged as much as 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
The sale was triggered by comments by central banker Michael Saunders, who raised the possibility of lowering interest rates even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the UK economy for the foreseeable future. This statement was surprising, as Saunders was considered a proponent of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of brokerage house ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed to the burden on the economy from the Brexit hiccup, without directly signaling a rate cut.
More: The British prime minister has taken a big risk with his provocations, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulation found
Material from the Moscow analysis lab is being manipulated, says David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and now head of integrity at the World Athletics Federation.
With the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details about the doping scandal in Russia are coming to light - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and even in a small way.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports was revealed. The WADA had banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee, after individual examination, allowed around 270 athletes of the country to compete at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio under a neutral flag, at the Winter Games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start.
No positive results were found
The following September, WADA lifted the Rusada ban again, but requested access to the laboratory and the samples in question. The data was to reveal the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in the state doping. They were to help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
The head of the IAAF's Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) has now confirmed that the data from the Moscow analysis lab on doping was manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force received the correct data", David Howman said in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Friday. "We found numerous discrepancies between the data that WADA received from a whistleblower and the data it received from the Russians in January".
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the position of the IAAF: the Athletics Federation is the only organization that maintains the ban on Russia. At the World Championships in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
Earlier this week, WADA had already put the manipulation in the open and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks, threatening to re-block Rusada and, in the worst case, ban it from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
