Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the law on the introduction of administrative liability for violation of the term and procedure of payment of goods (works, services) when carrying out procurement for state and municipal needs.
This law is intended to solve the very acute problem of non-fulfillment of their obligations by customers in the implementation of state and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs could not get paid for already executed state and municipal contracts was ubiquitous.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because businessmen themselves could not cope with unfair customers, who concluded contracts not supported by funding, tried in every way to evade the commitments to pay and included illegal terms in contracts.
The problem is systemic throughout the country.
Since 2015, in the interests of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment for public orders, the Prosecutor’s Office has submitted 9,7 thousand submissions, according to the results of their consideration, 4,5 thousand officials have been brought to disciplinary responsibility, to administrative - 533, 75 materials have been submitted to the investigative bodies for the organization of procedural checks, 46 of them have been opened criminal cases.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles was paid.
Moreover, these huge sums were accumulated far from the non-payment of multi-billion-dollar contracts.
The famous debts resulted in numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts.
This is a characteristic case.
The head of a small company won a competition for the provision of services on social transportation for several million rubles.
The man invested all his working funds, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the money in time.
The result is a growing financial volume of debt on wages, taxes, loans, which would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek help from the prosecutor’s office.
In some regions, the problem has been minimized.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts identified by prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where indebtedness continues to reach critical values, the prosecutor’s office operates in the mode of manual anti-crisis management.
The Prosecutor General personally holds exit meetings with representatives of the local authorities, at which all violations discovered by prosecutors and measures for their immediate elimination are subjectly examined.
Such operational meetings this year have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences as regards the establishment of administrative responsibility of officials of the customer for violation of the deadline and procedure for payment of goods (works, services) during procurement for state and municipal needs"
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia at the initiative of the Prosecutor General’s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on administrative offences with an article that provides for a fine from 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by an official of the customer of the term and procedure for payment of goods, works and services in state and municipal procurement.
If the official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he is disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative novels in practice.
Civil Rights Group Announces Warning on Movement in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Color Population has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri because of the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group’s statement reads as follows: “The National Association for the Advancement of Colour People’s Travel Warning, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be careful and to exercise extra caution when traveling across the state in connection with a series of suspicious racist incidents that have recently occurred across the state and have been cited here.”
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, a recent Missouri law has made it harder for people to win lawsuits related to discrimination and the fact that state law enforcement agencies disproportionately often choose minority persons as their objects.
“People are being violated human rights.
They are stopped on the roads because of their skin colour, beaten and killed,” said Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Missouri.
“We hear complaints more often than ever before.”
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization to the U.S. state.
The group cited incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders was killed in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had run out of gasoline while traveling through the state, and the Missouri police arrested him without being charged with the crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri General Prosecutor’s Office that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
“The purpose of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared in one way or another whether they will take money with them for collateral or tell relatives that they are traveling across the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI reporting program on hate crimes, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, making the state 16th in the state for such violations.
The move warning is also a response to a new Missouri law, after which it will be more difficult to bring a lawsuit against a legal entity for housing or labor discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for travelers across Texas and Arizona after these states passed new immigration control laws that ordered local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which ACLU believes should have increased the number of racial checks.
Movement warnings are typically issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed in shooting at police patrol in Egypt
Unknown men shot at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reports Reuters with reference to the Ministry of Interior of Egypt.
During the shooting two people, including one policeman, were killed, three people were wounded.
All the wounded were taken to hospital.
According to the agency, police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement.
One of the perpetrators was arrested and the other managed to escape.
Rosturism supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-return air tickets
The head of Rosturism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with the RBC television channel that he is "positive" to the adoption of the law on the cancellation of free baggage transport for non-return air tickets.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage," he said.
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the concerns of citizens, it will not be necessary to pay for the carriage of upper clothes and mobile phones in hand luggage.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and declare this, to say that this to top clothes, umbrella, mobile phone, iPad or even some computer relationship will have," - said the head of Rosturism.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the norm on free baggage transportation in case of a non-return airline ticket.
It is the fact that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of luggage included in the non-return rate.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate the pollution of the Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of the Baikal said that in recent years significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and executives for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out a full recovery of contaminated territories.
"It is necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the cleaning facilities of most of them are worn out," the president quoted RIA Novosti as saying.
He also added that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems related to the appearance of landfill and a number of violations in the sphere of ecology by the organizers of recreation.
"I want to emphasize this: not all in a row to check, here too the measure you need to know, but it is - illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General’s Office on the reduction of fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of objects subject to environmental supervision.
On June 15, Vladimir Putin announced the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural territories of special protection regime.
The problems with the conduct of economic activities were to him by the inhabitants of Olhon Island, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature Sergey Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, because the restrictions are related to a number of regulatory acts.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
There will be a new temple in the south.
In the village of Sosva, members of the community from the representatives of the indigenous peoples of the North "Rakhtynya", together with the inhabitants of the Berezovsky district, participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is a river bank, the temple will be well seen from a distance, so it will serve as a road beacon for fishermen.
According to the representatives of the community, the construction work will be completed this year, now the dome is installed, there are church bells.
The REB Navy provided transport accompaniment.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Miracle Maker, as it is honored by the Orthodox Church as the patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sousse, fishing provides settlers with work, feeds them.
Locals wait for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it in school writings as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are laws enforced in Singapore?
I talk to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an open-air snack bar.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, and safely stores the cigarettes in a iron box caught with him from the office.
After the conversation ends, the businessman moves to the nearest urn - a hundred meters away - and throws the bulls there.
The fine for garbage in a public place is $500 local, Chang reports.
You know, since I was a child, I just developed a reflex: you can't throw a fancy from candy on the bridge, you will be fined immediately.
Now there are video cameras everywhere.
And indeed - Singapore's sidewalks in the city center are clean, like a museum.
Chang says: Three months ago, the 18-year-old son of his neighbor painted a graffiti wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the man guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to corruption.
What ? →
Imagine yourself .
He was hit by a wooden stick in his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
Physical punishment is not uncommon.
How Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly strict laws, the AIF reviewer understood on the spot.
No one is thinking about abolishing the death penalty here, lawyer Victor Lee Hong explains.
And the government has long cared about the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this matter.
If a person carries a large batch of drugs or deals with them, he is subjected to hanging.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian was arrested at the Changi airport: he carried 400 grams of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian prime minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights activists and even Pope Francis.
The man was eventually hanged.
After that, the drug couriers roam our country diligently.
The point is this: in Singapore it is prescribed that the laws are obliged to comply with ALL in a row, not just the humble and poor people.
It doesn’t matter who you are – a millionaire, a vice-premier, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
The option in this case is one: if you find half a kilo of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you encounter signs with a bunch of warnings, you simply wonder - how many in this city-state of prohibitions!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly on a prescription (!) of a doctor.
The tourist on arrival gum will not be taken away, but it is worth sticking the "gum" in the subway, will be fined in 1 thousand local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white signs on their necks: “I was rubbishing.”
For throwing past the urn, in addition to a fine, they are often sentenced to "linking to the courtyards": a week to clean the parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles. pay the "criminal", who forgot to wash the water in the public toilet, and when trying to solve a small need in the elevator of a residential house, a special detector works - the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the very exotic laws - prohibitions on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of the indoor plant (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers are not allowed to bring light bulbs in the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5 thousand Singapore dollars.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how you try, you will definitely break something.
This is not the case at all, Muhammad Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of the local travel agency, tries to dissuade me.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone attracted for their violation.
Why are they preserved?
The citizens are not relaxed.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
Let’s say, if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, then everyone in the chain will be punished: the store owner will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will be hit with sticks on the “back”, and the seller will also be ripped out and imprisoned.
It is because of such strict laws that crimes are very rare in Singapore.
Is this justified?
In the 1970s, there was chaos on the roads - motorists ignored the lighting, drove as they wanted, drove drunk.
After the introduction of fines for a year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, after drinking a portion of whiskey, knows: if stopped, the police officer will not be released for bribery, will be fined in the amount of the value of the apartment and sent to jail for years.
For many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems to be a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - a guest from the United States horrored the general wealth of the inhabitants, "terrifyingly clean airport" and "cultured nature".
To say, such things are unnatural, look artificial, and so in principle should not be.
First days in Singapore and you are really afraid to throw paper on the sidewalk, you get caught up if you enter the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the "Little India" district, and suddenly - a "breaking pattern": plastic glasses roll at the bus stop.
“How is it?” you wonder.
Singaporeans are laughing.
Everything happens.
Not for every such "crime" will be caught on the spot, but you must know: if you are calculated, you will not retaliate - because you have violated the law.
Most often this is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, I moved very carefully – motorcyclists often pick up smartphones and cameras from the hands of tourists.
The centre of Paris is full of dirty bombs and beggars.
On our streets, too, not everyone tries to throw rubbish into urns.
Singapore, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth.
You will think.
This is human nature: remember, and in Russia no one was attached to driving until they were fined.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we have to think, in Russia, people would also be pleased with clean streets, the absence of garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
This is body punishment, thank you.
In other words, the laws of Singapore are at least worth looking at them.
Nothing holy?
Trump’s White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of a regime change is when it starts fighting the statues.
Americans understand this no worse than everyone else – hence the intentional theatrical demolition of Saddam Hussein’s statue on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Steven Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump administration, was undoubtedly aware of what he was doing when he took a symbolic tail over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the president’s proposals to sharply reduce legal immigration.
Let’s be honest, Miller didn’t hit the statue itself.
Regiments of hiking boat owners and artists portraying the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried to do so.
But he tried its meaning, and especially the meaning that was attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the piedestal.
As Miller whispered on the Acosta: “I don’t want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you’re talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller put the facts right, but as he said, it’s not really about history.
It is about the current sound of the striking words of Lazarus, the only in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming of breathing freely, / The unfortunate waste of your abundant shores."
Never before have “unfortunate waste” been so visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaged in literature studies - he made it clear that in America Trump is not expected by these people.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus — and her friends who fought to put her words on the basement of the statue after her death — knew very well that they were committing an entirely political act.
The sculpture was designed to mark the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Exiled.
The combination of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though changed it back.
Rush Limbau, a kind of John the Baptist who announced the arrival of Trump, in 2010 argued that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neoconservative who carries America’s flame to a world lying in the dark: “Freedom goes forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the United States.”
Contrary to the usual, Limbos really got into the point here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, unfortunate but hopeful people on the deck of ships after a long and often tough sailing.
It literally means looking at the world through the eyes of people who are looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue is answered by the words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, this is not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to recognize.
Their torch is not needed to illuminate the way, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake highlights the Scottish members of the UK national team.
Eileen Doyle recalls the time when there were only two Scots in the UK national team
Neil Blake, the game director of the British Athletics Federation, said that the 16-man Scottish team at the World Cup would make a “significant contribution to the team’s game.”
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for the 2017 London Championship, which begins on Friday.
Blake believes that something special is being born in Scotland and the British Athletics Federation should take this into account.
“We know this and we’re trying to understand and we’re going to support them as long as they have the potential,” Blake said.
“I’ve spoken to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it’s because of what they did.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks they have to work on what they have done.
The British Athletics Federation: What they have done, we have to work on.
People on the street think the same.
I don’t know why this happened, but it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Some of the Scottish athletes are claiming medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah on the 5000m distance; and Eileen Doyle team has chosen their captain.
Elijah is humble.
Her captain’s speech was great,” Blake says.
“Many athletes, whether they are Scots or not, and where they live or train, have left the room feeling proud and willing to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eileen put in her were wonderful.”
The possessor of the silver medal of the Commonwealth Championship, who at her fifth World Championship will run a distance of 400 meters with obstacles, says that the 16 Scots in the British national team is "incredible".
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Later is Laura Moore, who specializes in mid-distance running and broke five British and two European records last year.
She will run at 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O’Hare, who will take part in the 1500m race, is another Scottish to pay attention to: he has a successful season behind him, in which there were victories in the selection competitions of the British national team and the Annual competitions.
Doyle recalls her first world championship, when besides her the only Scottish in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots not only entered the national team, but in some cases will claim medals and fight for the final.
"The captain of the national team is chosen by other team members, so it was a great honor in any case, but to know that your comrades voted for you and chose you is a very special thing for me," she added.
“Of course, I’m very proud of all the Scots who came into the national team.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all held athletes who will strive to get on the piedestal of honor.
What about my captain’s speech?
Yes, I think she was not bad.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Championship at home.
So it’s just about how important it is to get support from our fans and take advantage of being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go into his arena and compete, and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don’t run for public office if you’re not ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
Americans loved George Washington, but that didn’t stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism annoyed him.
But he did not shut his mouth to his critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said: “Freedom of speech can be taken away and we, the deaf and the dumb, will be led like sheep to slaughter.”
Now I’ll go to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to look more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
This week, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him.
The governor's subordinates called the lawsuit null and the commentary on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well and what".
“It’s just Facebook,” many will say.
But it is also important.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a predominantly democratic state.
He is in second place in the rating of approval among 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He demonstrated a strong hand in state management and a commitment to his principles.
He also skillfully uses Facebook as his primary way of communicating with his voters and jokingly shows his bald head on his page after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor’s page – which is stated as an official public forum and is run by administration officials for taxpayers’ money – is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Ches defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking comments was just moderation.
But it’s too easy – to use the image of trolls, spammers, and hackers who are wicked on the internet.
The Post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people, not trolls, teachers, businessmen, pastors, who turn to their chosen leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan was a Catholic.
Laxmi’s lawyer Sarma Ramana from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred but asked about hate crimes.
“I wrote a polite comment that I am disappointed by his lack of reaction to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in the post.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it's a so-called twist instead of admitting they're dealing with a large group of dissatisfied citizens."
What the governor’s subordinates call a “centric spam attack,” others would probably call an “active life position.”
In the era of Facebook, it’s easy to sub-edit your image by simply blocking critics or wiping out negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than it used to be when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical headlines, or arresting and clogging the mouths of protesters.
But that’s exactly what’s happening now, only in numbers.
Hogan is not the first official to be criticized for not listening to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who were banned in his Twitter account.
One of the first turnaround decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge from Alexandria, James K. Kasheris, Laudon County Chairman of the Supervisory Board violated the First Amendment by hacking a voter on his Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bevin has been sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so difficult.
In Washington’s time, the era of affordable postal expenses made roughly the same turnaround as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters severely undermined his authority.
Even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms “Juricola”, “Valerius”, “Belizarius” and “Portius” wrote letters to newspapers that ridiculed Washington’s decision.
According to historical documents collected by the online George Washington Documents project, his office has been overwhelmed by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty on Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he did not try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and expression is the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing to it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for household conveniences at the Renaissance club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes to have home conveniences for the next three days when the East Lothian Renaissance club will host the twenty-fifth Scottish Open Golf tournament for elderly athletes.
The native of Northern Ireland, who led the neighborhood at Archerfield Links and moved towards the final round last year until losing Paul Ilsu, is attached to the new place and serves as a representative of the tournament on behalf of club founder and director Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we’re watching it come to success with this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players will see this field at its best, it’s in great condition.
Jerry did a great job arranging this place.
He is a fierce supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It’s a great demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ils is looking forward to the opportunity to defend the championship title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“It’s a really special feeling,” said the Southport player.
“I failed to try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife Sharon it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time and we will always remember it.”
Gary Orr is back in his homeland, joining the European Tournament for elderly athletes after he turned 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“When you play at home, it’s always a bit more important,” said Helensboro Orr.
“You want to perform well, but you feel that extra burden.”
I was very pleased to play again and I played good golf.
I’m pleased with how everything goes so far.”
On the field to this trio will join former Masters winner Ian Wusnem and champions major for older athletes Paul Brodherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNally.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the pitch; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmayr and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs £5 per hour if one person is in the car, and £10 if two or more people.
All revenue goes to the British Prostate Cancer Fund.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Tunnels over highways that can absorb the carbon dioxide emitted by cars are already being tested on UK roads.
The transport agency of the country, according to the publication Autocar, positive results of tests of the 100-meter tunnel, installed on one of the highway in the north of the country.
The 6-meter-high tunnel is built of some of the latest polymer materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the creation of a network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures the UK authorities are about to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce the traffic on the roads, expand the use of commercial transport on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is caused by transportation, and inadequate air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths a year.
Moscow city court changed the punishment of disabled Mamayev to a fine
The Moscow city court changed the punishment of the disabled Anton Mamayev, sentenced to four and a half years of colony, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
This is by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor’s office asked the court to replace the term with a conditional term, explaining its request by the fact that Mamayev’s disease “impedes him from being in prison conditions.”
28-year-old Anton Mamayev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with serving a sentence in a colony of the general regime for robbery, the victim of which was a former fighter of the special forces.
On July 19, the court at the exit session in the SIZO released the man from custody.
Poverty and death in Indonesia’s “golden land”
While cooking lunch, Bardeen Degey does not use the plate.
She even rarely uses bad.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Panay County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just puts a sweet potato, which is called a “note” here, right into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the bulbs are taken and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degee sits on the ground floor — she has no furniture — and here she does her homework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby mud.
The bathroom serves as a cage in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not instructed to work in the field.
Multitasking is widespread here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“Nobody dares to walk around the village after five o’clock,” she says.
It is a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the high mountains of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote, publicly raising their hands before the occupying troops.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands has quickly turned its anger against the government of Jakarta, whichins tight control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights activists.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jaapura, the administrative center of the province, to Naber, and then a five-hour rush in a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; the roofs of wooden steel are painted with rust in a variety of redish shades.
Few Indonesians arrived here, not to mention journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Prior to the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear these clothes,” says Degey, pointing to his bright, stitched hand turban, a dark shirt and a bright shirt.
“We used to wear only leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy levels among the worst in Asia.
This is Indonesia’s golden land.
The world’s largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Panay, a high-mountain province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
Freeport produced gold and copper for approximately $3.1 billion in 2015.
In addition, Papua boasts forest reserves estimated at $78 billion.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the Papuas, ensuring that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to a 2005 investigation by the New York Times, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local soldiers and units $20 million, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
Demands for greater autonomy by the Papuas threaten the existence of this golden veil and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuan have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings in the indigenous high mountains of Papua in the 1970s can be considered a genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything,” a report published in 2016 by the diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – frequent, as claimed in another report, rape and electric shock – and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The hikes were delayed as Papua's resources attracted the influx of displaced people from other parts of Indonesia.
The 3,5-million population of the province is 83 percent Christian, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese shops, "varung", sell fried chicken and a mixture of vegetables "gado-gado", served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to withstand the competition.
“Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abet Yoou, a twenty-four-year-old Panyai native who moved to Jaapura, the province’s administrative center, for work.
“Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua – the mother-mother (women) of Papua – have lost their marketplace.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Djokovic, vowed to address inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter gained support from 27 of Papua’s 29 districts, including Panaya.
But almost nothing has changed in Papua, and the locals feel dedicated.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Djokovic, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” Jo said.
In fact, only two months after Djokovic's October inauguration, Panay survived a tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing the Christmas hymns at a fire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle escaped from the dark.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javed Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and returned after a while with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers who were drunk were chasing the children and beating them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julian Aimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby government building of the election commission, and the next day the situation worsened.
Around a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of a local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed wita, a dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe: they ran in circles and depicted bird singing.
Some protesters started throwing stones at a police station and a military base.
When the situation escalated, the internal radio communications soldiers were ordered, “If the crowd resisted more than three times, shoot them,” as it sounded, as claimed in an official document, which was seen by Times correspondents, but which was not published in local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremias Kaiame, the head of the Kego Coto district in Enarotali, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, asking the crowd to walk around the houses.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned, a bullet suddenly hit my left wrist,” he told Time magazine, standing on the doorstep of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kaiame still does not know who fired, but says the bullet arrived from the side of the square of gathered soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there were many shots,” he added.
The local resident Alfius Yove was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” said Johannes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
“I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.”
General Yotje Mende, the senior inspector of Papua police, told reporters that his officers were simply “defending” their base because it was being attacked.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papuan police spokesman Commissary Pudjo Sulissio said in 2015.
“It is a question of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were wounded.
The news of the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Djokovic delivered a fierce speech in Jaapura, in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historic abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be settled immediately so that it never happens again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, the security minister said he would set up a non-judicial organization to put an end to historic human rights violations.
The excuses came almost immediately.
Most of the violations have occurred for a long time.
Some of them took place in the nineties or at the beginning of the zero.
The fact is that we, of course, want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be passed," he said.
Viranto then gave up his words, speaking to Time magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he did not plan to set up an organization to handle complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be decided through the court.”
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999, said 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Panaya incident.
The families of the victims from Panaya have met such statements with dark suspicion.
“Over the past three years I’ve been questioned four times, but there’s been absolutely no change,” says Johannes.
“I am tired.”
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
“I am scared,” he says.
“I am afraid that the military will arrest me, I am afraid that I will be shot.”
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the inhabitants of Panay are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he says.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired fire on villagers in the neighboring Panyai district of Deiyai.
During a clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help take a man unconscious to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were wounded, including children.
A man, 24-year-old Ravianu Dove, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the office of the construction site owned by the company.
According to police, the villagers threw stones at officers, who in response fired warning shots.
But local residents claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation,” said the twenty-nine-year-old Dominggu Badiya, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being rushed.
“I was hiding at home for two days.”
The Deiyai Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called for response, and the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Panya has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development causes dissatisfaction among the Meiji, Monini, Dani and Damal tribes, scattered throughout the greenery of the central high mountainous areas of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Free Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuan people by organizing sporadic attacks and raids with kidnapping of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of OPM’s top executives come from Panaya, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In retaliation, thousands of people have been arrested and unjustified by the military in Panaya in recent years under the pretext of “defending national independence.”
Some have never returned.
Among the population, Papua Panaya is considered “a sad, forgotten place.”
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is not available to the same extent.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly note, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four to five sweet potato fields.
Usually they keep most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten cluster notes are worth just 10,000 Indonesian Rupee (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between indigenous Papuan and new migrants, who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabire Airport, has increased.
Few existing vacancies are usually available to more educated and wealthy immigrants.
Papuas rarely have enough money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village... because there’s no work or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Panay Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain tough.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Eskudy and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for “lack of coherence with relevant organizations” despite being granted rare video permits.
According to Felim Kine, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, Jokov’s campaign promises to lift restrictions on media work in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Now foreign journalists trying to report from rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, are facing new dangers: visa refusal and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua’s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – appealed to the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “varied and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Panaya shooting.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramana Nasser rejected the group's statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia still has a democratic system and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of episodes of human rights violations."
Local residents want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by Dutch human rights ambassador Keys Van Baar, visited Jaapura on May 4, local residents broke the silence, begging, “We want freedom,” as said by a source who was also present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but the Papuan people say they are unlikely to vote for Djokovic again.
“Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Panay shooting,” says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Djokovic to know that the people of Panyai, besides living in the shadow of the threat from the greedy army, are plunged into poverty, and their education and healthcare are in a miserable state.
Gobi says that the inhabitants of Panyai, like other Papuas, consider their vote for Djokovic a debt to pay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Panay shooting carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not let the culprits forget their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” Jacob said without raising his head.
“What else had we to do?”
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Fakel"
A fire hit one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to rush out of the 337-meter-high seventy-nine-story structure.
This is the second fire that has hit the high-rise building – which coincidentally is called the “Fake” – in two years.
Evacuation was carried out in the building, no human casualties were, and there were no operational news about the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from fire alarms and people’s screams.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fifty floor," a resident of the skyscraper named George told Reuters.
According to the Civil Defense Department of the city of Dubai, firefighters extinguished the fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing asylum to the victims.
The incident could bring back on the agenda the safety of materials used in the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
In the course of the investigation by the administration of "Fakela" after the fire there in 2015, it was revealed that the most affected plaque - external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believe the insulation system and plating panels at the Grenfell Tower in London could accelerate the spread of the June fire that killed about 80 people.
Growth of tourist flow in Idah Viruma in June proved to be minimal
As follows from the data received by the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 the services of the hotel enterprises of the Northeast used a total of 20 519 local and foreign tourists, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has decreased, and foreign tourists have increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
The number of Russian tourists increased most significantly in the region – by 8.9% or 318 people compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, 3885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed at the Idah Viruma hotels.
Andrei Malakhov has made it clear to fans who is to blame for his departure
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram who is to blame for his departure from the "First" channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today posted a fragment of the article of the newspaper "Vedomosti" for August 1.
Photo Malakhov signed with the tag "boss milk sauce".
Article on how to prevent the "burn out" of the employee and pay attention to his condition.
If you recall the numerous reports that the host was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who took to re-format "Let's talk", it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted.
As, TV host Andrei Malakhov is currently on leave and has not signed an application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation with the dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
Five soldiers killed in car explosion in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Hilmend, reports RIA Novosti.
According to the police, a mined car exploded on the eve near the military post in Girishk county.
20 dead are known.
A new incident occurred on Friday morning in Grizzly.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver filmed a shark biting his camera
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal (Greg Skomal) captured a video of a shark biting his GoPro action camera.
The video was posted on Facebook by a division of the U.S. Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, whose employee is Skomal.
The incident occurred on August 2 near the shores of the Cape Cod peninsula in the northeast of the United States, the portal Necn reports.
A man during a submarine attempted to take the shark on the camera, which he held on a special stick.
Seeing a man, an animal over three meters long floated towards him.
The shark started to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator acted in a similar way to determine whether the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of the marine animal was a novelty for scientists.
The cause of the fighting in the Ural military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Yelan Training Center, where a massive fight occurred, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this attack have already been known.
According to the publication Mash, which appeared on the page "VKontakte", the contractors of the Ural military unit number 31612 violently fought because of the unrestrained bed.
It all started with the fact that a soldier named Sayan demonstrately ignored the officer's order to fill the torch.
Officers from the sixth company stood on the side of the officer.
Sayan supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young men were defeated in the barracks beds and shells, broke glasses.
More than ten people were injured in the fighting.
The CFO denied the information about the foot.
The study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the U.S. carry banned items onto the plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried banned items in their luggage on board the aircraft through the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent boarding the aircraft, unattended with banned knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 percent said they later discovered that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and covered more than 1,000 people also found that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that was banned by the ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Consciously past the ATB employees most often leak food and water.
More than 3 percent admitted that they specifically carried sharp objects through the inspection, while 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men admitted that they deliberately carried illegal drugs onto the plane.
The company said it investigated passengers across the country to find out how many of them accidentally smuggled through airport inspections, and how many did so deliberately.
It is expected that most often – consciously or unconsciously – the smugglers are pulled through the inspection by those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the ATB rules are quite complicated and confusing.
People often don’t know exactly what fluids they can carry and in what quantity.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATB takes is banned fluids.
Some time ago, people thought that the ATB could consider it forbidden to carry books.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA chief Pruitt rejects intention to postpone implementation of Obama’s emissions reduction rules
The day after 15 states filed a lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency canceled his decision to postpone the implementation of Obama’s rules aimed at reducing emissions of air pollutants and smog-causing substances.
Pruitt explained his decision by the fact that now his agency is larger than in previous administrations, listening to the needs of the environmental regulators of individual states.
He did not mention a lawsuit against his previous position filed with the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute revolved around the deadline on October 1, by which the states must ensure compliance with 2015 ozone standards on the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone their observance by one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid "disagreement with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma’s Attorney General before being appointed by President Trump to his current position, has long been known as a consistent opponent of tightening environmental regulations.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of regulations that were opposed by the chemical or gas-oil industries.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of Pewitt’s course to return to the previous norms.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington ruled that the EPA chief exceeded his powers in an attempt to postpone the implementation of the Obama administration’s rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that by sharply changing the course of ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA’s obligation to cooperate with the states in a comprehensive process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA was often unable to meet the deadlines, then awaited lawsuits from groups of activists and other individuals and discussed deadlines in the settlement of the case,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take our charter and the power it gives us seriously.”
However, the EPA statement said that Pruitt could at some point again use its “delaying powers and other given by law powers” to make sure that the rules “jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information.”
Republicans in Congress are insisting on a broader revision of ozone regulations.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, aims to postpone the implementation of 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on the matter.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intended to continue legal pressure.
“The EPA change – after our lawsuits – is an important victory in the struggle for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog covering their cities,” Schneiderman said.
The lawsuit of New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Earth-level ozone occurs when ordinary pollutants from machinery, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health advocates and environmentalists have welcomed the unexpected change in Pruitt’s course.
“It’s hard to think about how much pressure it took to get this logical step from the person who is tasked with protecting the air we breathe,” said Laurie Ann Byrd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.”
IAAF Congress extends suspension of All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (VFLA).
Thus, Congress endorsed the IAAF Board on the restoration of the FLA, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension remain in force.
For the extension of the suspension voted 166 people, against - 21, reports TASS.
The IAAF Board report stated that the IAAF has made substantial progress in achieving the conditions set by the re-membering board, but these conditions have not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the WFL at the World Championship in London, Russian athletes were forced to play under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
WFLA was indefinitely disqualified by the IAAF in 2015.
Then a report by an independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was published, which mentioned numerous violations of WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For more details on the latest IAAF board report, see the article "The IAAF has extended sanctions against the IAAF".
Insulting defeat
Within the framework of the 3rd round of the Fonbet championship of Russia among the teams of the PFL, the new-Moscow "Chemic" held a departure match against FC "Kaluga".
A little more than 10 days ago, the rivals played between themselves in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"Chemic" was not inferior to the opponent in anything, but secondary relaxation at the outcome of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat from the calugans with a score of 0:3 many in advance predicted an easy victory of the masters.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the Novomoskovans forced themselves to count and acted from the defense, but from the position of force.
In the first half, the squad made more and had an advantage in the possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was played by Alexei Sirotin, who repeatedly repelled dangerous strikes and gave confidence to his partners.
Unfortunately, in the attack "Chemic" lacked effort and luck to put Kaluga's defense into a deadlock and score the first goal at the exit.
After the break, the game began on the opposite courses.
The New Yorkers played more actively in the attack.
The alarming bells for our team were defensive mistakes, which allowed the squad to create a number of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, "Chemic" intercepted the territorial advantage and conducted several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the calugans played a role - they more competently and cold-bloodedly held the finish, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, "Chemic" transferred the ball to the corner, the supply of which the field owners without resistance transferred to the gate.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovnik.
In the reporting meeting "Chemic" demonstrated a good game, but suffered an offensive defeat.
In front of our team awaits another exit - on August 11 at 19:00 in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named after Eduard Streltsov Novomoskovs will battle with the favourite of the group "Center" FC "Ararat", which is composed of Roman Pavluchenko, Marat Izmaylov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support the chemistry!
Place and time of the meeting - 18 h 30 min. near the store "Magnolia" (Eastern, d.2, cor.
The composition of "Chemics": Sirotin, Manochin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogiya (Oreshkin), Dudaichi, Ryzhov, Svitov, Belian (Adoevtsev), Andreichenko (Lygin)

According to published encryptions of phone conversations, Trump pressured Mexico over paying for the wall on the border
The Washington Post newspaper published deciphering of phone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump insisted that he cease publicly stating that he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The U.S. President insulted him for publicly speaking against the wall and, according to leaked information, told him, “You can’t tell the press.”
Trump began his election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed that he would force Mexico to pay for the project.
The published decoding of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a hot breakdown.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the U.S. should accept refugees heading to Australia was “laughable”, “abominable” and “dumb,” and insisted that because of the agreement the Obama administration would look like an idiot as he intended to stop the resettlement of refugees to the U.S.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant conversation in the whole day.”
The bodies of the dead in Abkhazia tourist sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The aircraft, owned by the airline "Russia", on board which are the bodies of Russian women killed in Abkhazia, flew at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS reports.
At the end point of departure the flight will be met by employees of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city council, Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamyr Ahba told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Emergencies of the republic said that all the costs associated with the delivery of the bodies back to Russia, took over the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay the families of the victims compensation in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Ahba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed the willingness to pay the relatives of the dead as a result of the explosions tourists travel and residence in the republic, but the relatives sent to the republic only powers on the right to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On August 2, about 16:20 Moscow time, two explosions occurred in the village Primorsky of the Gudaut district on the warehouse of missile and artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the republic, after which large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there began to detonate.
As a result, there was a fire in the warehouse, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result of the accident, two Russian citizens were killed - Elena Polyakova, born in 1970, and Elena Timofeev, born in 1962, who were on vacation near a sulfur hydrogen source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were transported to medical institutions of the republic with injuries of varying degrees of severity.
At present, seven people remain in the hospital, the rest are released.
A large jury will study Russian influence on the US elections
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington that will study Russia’s influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Wall Street Journal and Reuters reports.
The Grand Jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The special prosecutor will examine the collected materials and decide whether they are sufficient for prosecution.
The convening of a large jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect witnesses.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of then-Presidential candidate Donald Trump with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
To check the details of this meeting, which took place in June 2016, previously promised Mueller himself.
They are investigated by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was that Donald Trump Jr. has expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. previously said that from the meeting with Veselnitskaya he expected a compromise on the headquarters of the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but no exposing documents were presented, and in the end it was about adoption.
At the beginning of August in a number of media appeared information that the statement of Trump Jr. about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump senior.
The White House said the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would do.
Deputy Mayor of Penza detained at work
Deputy head of the administration of Penza Irina Shirshina was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at her workplace, reports RIA Novosti.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on this occasion have not yet been received, but the press service of the SU SC assured that they will soon follow.
Pence City Council has not yet commented on the incident.
Irina Shirshina is one of five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has been in charge of urban planning and land relations since April 2015.
Prior to this, she worked for a long time as the head of the management of the State Building Inspectorate in the Penzhen region.
Irina Shirshina is raising three minor children, notably, that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she gave up maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there are no cosmodroms or missile carriers in Mexico.
But there is a space agency founded in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first man in space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are demolished in some countries, the monuments to Gagarin, on the contrary, "go around the planet".
In 2012, the monument was installed in Houston, near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was installed in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfurt, where our astronaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) avoided demolition in 1992 thanks to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin in Riga appeared a monument to Yuri Gagarin.
This is the name and surname of the first cosmonaut in Latvian, and he looks like he is 70 years old.
Murder at Morse Ford: Activists Lose Lynch's Trials on Stage to Call for Justice
"Ford Mercury" of 1948 passed by spectators in the village of Monroe in the state of Georgia and rushed to the small Bridge of Mors Ford.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
The main - a middle-aged man in a fin strip costume - pulled a cigar and looked through the windscreen.
The people inside trembled of fear.
“We need this nigger, Roger!” the man cried out.
“Take him out of the car!”
The screams broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene, which took place on July 22, is just an inscenation.
But when a loop was thrown on Roger's neck, almost all the spectators really stopped breathing.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Mors Ford Bridge to re-defeat the night in 1946, when the doll clans lynched two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted for these killings.
“It’s surprising that no one has been arrested in all these years – although we see them next to us; although we know who they are,” says Tyran Brooks, who helped organise the production.
“It’s a stain on our history and it’s a stone on our souls.”
71-year-old Brooks is a former congressman of Georgia who has fought for human rights all his life.
For him, the show is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe residents that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want investigations, we want conclusions, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he said.
“We can’t move on to healing and reconciliation until we get justice.”
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the lynching at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI materials received by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of involvement in lynching.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been on the lookout for decades, human rights activists say the city has always known the two connected motives of the lynchers: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling for the first time allowed black citizens to vote for the primaries, which were to take place that summer.
About during the same election, according to FBI reports, the black exploiter Roger Malcolm struck in a knife fight Barnett Hester, a white landowner — apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumors spreading in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she was supposed to have was not from her husband.
According to FBI reports, on July 25, 1946, Lloyd Harrison, a large white landowner, paid a $600 bail to free Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove out of prison and approached the Mors Ford Bridge, a crowd of lynchers surrounded the car.
"It is being established that Harrison organized and commanded the killings," a report from the FBI said.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the law enforcement authorities of the state and the city, which not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses.”
Brooks calls it shorter.
“It was an attempt at voting rights,” he said.
“They were all killed to send a signal to black people in the city: if you register and vote, you will be the same.”
For a decade, Cassandra Green has directed an annual show recreating the lynching at the Mors Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visible, it captures the viewer and tells about that profound racism that, as many would like to think, is no longer in America.
It’s hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green thinks that’s the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I’ve experienced.”
The rehearsals of this year’s play began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors – a dozen white, the rest black – gathered in the room and listened to the review of the play shredded over the years.
Wade Marbo was the director along with Green.
He played the role of the chief member of the clan for several years, but says the role has never become easier.
“I feel like I’ve gotten upset because it’s not the person I am,” says Marbo.
“But I think it’s very important to remember this story because we don’t want to go back to that time.”
In the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascone, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The show begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, shouting and pushing him.
“I said, nigga, get out of my house!”
I scream in response.
A blow is given.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all black actors) is reflected in a whistle.
Green laughed louder.
“What is it?” asks Ascon.
He is worried and embarrassed.
Am I overplaying?
“No,” Greene said through laughter.
“I just don’t think white people said ‘nigga’ at the time.”
“Yes,” laughs one of the black performers.
“You have to make a hard ‘r’.”
And the energy in the room also changes: discomfort is replaced by a sense of companionship.
Everyone must do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of four killed people.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the word on the letter "n", it turns out to be clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Cries, shots and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billy Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
Her voice was interrupted by a word.
A hundred yards from it, half a hundred spectators wipe away tears and sweat from their eyes.
There are almost equal numbers of black and white spectators.
A couple came from Itaca, New York to watch the show; many live nearby.
They all endured the heavy blow of Georgia for almost eight hours, while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until then, the murders were only history, but now, as they stand in the same place where they lynched people, it seems that their ghosts are in the air.
When the last note of the song is silenced, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
The children bend to their heads, touch the paint depicting blood, and fixed bodies, and whisper something to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” a little boy cried out, as if to remind himself of it.
After a few minutes, Green thanked the spectators, and suddenly it was over.
The actors throw off ropes from their necks and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbo, a man in a costume who played the main doll clown.
Nick Rascona hugs two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the show finally fell on him.
“Everything is fine,” a woman whispered.
“We know your heart is good.
You had a reason for that.”
Later, the spectators sit down for dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta lively discusses a show with a black couple they just met.
Denisa Daplinsky struggles to find words to describe what she feels after the show.
“It’s hard to listen to those horrible, horrible words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she says.
“After that, I think that lynching is still happening,” she adds, “only now it’s called that the police are shooting.”
In the other corner of the room, the general attention was taken by Tyran Brooks, who recalls his work as a human rights activist after a meal.
He says he has already begun planning a show next year.
“The show inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we’ve experienced, it also teaches us,” he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it.”
Navalny fined for violations of the "agitation Saturday"
The Simonovsky court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny with 300 thousand rubles for violating the order of organization of the rally.
He was found guilty of committing an administrative offence under Part 8 of Art. 20.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Re-violation of the order of organization of the rally".
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky court of Moscow Hyzir Musakaev finished considering the administrative case against Leonid Volkov - the head of the headquarters of the opposition Alexei Navalny, who was brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
In this amount, the judge Musakaev estimated the spread of leaflets on the "agitation Saturday", which Navalny supporters held in Moscow on July 8-9th.
After seeing the animated materials that monitored the participants of the Saturday, the police found that the organizers of the event intentionally concealed its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to request permission from the capital authorities in advance).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev applied for the termination of the administrative proceedings in connection with the absence of the composition of the offence and pointed out that the police committed certain errors when drawing up the protocol.
At the very "agitation Saturday" Volkov was not detained, but he received an agenda obliging him to appear at the police station to tell about the event, held with his active participation.
The same agenda received Navalny himself and another opposition associate - Nikolai Lyaskin.
In Mordovia arrested who shot the bride and three guests of the wedding
A court in Mordovia has arrested a local resident who shot four people at a wedding, including his bride.
This was in the republican administration of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During the dispute, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk several times shot at the guests of the event, who came to the rural pond to swim.
As a result, three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been initiated under paragraph "a" of part 1 of Article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Huliganism"), part 3 of Article 30 and paragraphs "a", "e", "and" of part 2 of Article 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Attempt to murder two or more persons, committed in a generally dangerous way, from hooliganism").
According to Interfax, local media that the man opened fire because of the fact that the wedding guests, having decided to take a bath, went through the territory of his site to the reservoir.
Ministry of Energy will tighten requirements for suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for providing information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, turbines of hydroelectric power plants, oil pumping facilities and oil production equipment suppliers will be obliged to share data on access to it with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft government resolution has already been prepared and brought for public discussion.
The new requirements will only affect "critical energy equipment" supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document called such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the control of the object by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, dishonest partners and hackers.
EU extends anti-Russian sanctions over Siemens
On August 4, the press service of the European Union said that the anti-Russian sanctions were extended due to the scandal surrounding the supply of Siemens turbines to Crimea.
This was earlier in the “Arguments of the Week”.
The press service of the Council of the EU said that the sanctions against the Russian Federation were expanded due to the scandal with the Siemens turbines, which were allegedly delivered to Crimea to circumvent the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries on expanding anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was that the final decision will be taken by the end of the current day, and the decision has been taken, sanctions against Russia have been expanded.
Pearson cuts 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the Pearson education group announced it would cut 3,000 more jobs and cut the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 percent in connection with the start of another restructuring program aimed at tackling the challenges facing their business.
These job cuts, which CEO John Fallon said will mainly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut during the previous restructuring.
Pearson has announced it plans to cut spending by another £300 million ($394 million) in May as part of its third spending cuts program to try to revive the business hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1% increase in mainstream sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed as a result of a deadly explosion
According to official sources, a suicide terrorist attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, NATO said in a statement.
According to unchecked data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the city district of Karabakh.
This explosion is the last of the bloodshed that hit Afghanistan this month: more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO report, the explosion, which occurred on Thursday evening, occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with the help of a “human-transported self-made explosive device.”
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan, and about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bombing in a car killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
More than 150 people were killed in a powerful explosion in the city centre on May 31, the most serious terrorist attack in the country since the United States-led troops removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence emphasizes the unreliable situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is assessing the need to increase the number of U.S. military forces providing assistance to the troops and police in the country.
Correspondents say the terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its line of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
Environmental Protection Agency after court lawsuits cancels decision to postpone adoption of air pollution law
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has revoked its decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama-era law, which states must limit air polluting emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "Ozone 2015 measurements", stressing that this move shows the agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness toward them,” said Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency’s intention to postpone ozone measurements, where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country, to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter air purity standards, for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, along with the Federal District of Columbia filed a lawsuit claiming that the intent was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to overturn the broad range of environmental regulations introduced by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader program aimed, Trump said, at brilliant economic growth.
But actions in this direction have sparked resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations, concerned about the potential impact of high emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency's website says that using ozone-containing air to breathe "can worsen lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
European Business Association opposes new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association has expressed its disagreement with U.S. economic sanctions against Russia.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
Business is one of the important links between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
The European business unites more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask police to restrict traffic on the shore in Pskov
Pskov people's elected members sent an appeal to the head of the UMVD for the city, Sergey Surin, on the problem of movement along the Great River.
Deputies of pride Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Stronenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their opinion, control over drivers will help make this area more peaceful and safe.
The problem is that the offenders ignore the signs of the "walkway" and ride freely on the shore.
It turns out that major repairs and repairs were carried out in vain.
Sports and children's playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable because of cars.
As noted by the Pskov Information Agency, in the evening the central shore is patrolled by the staff of the PPS motorcycle patrol and companions.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars is becoming less, but the traffic is not completely stopped.
Putin urged investigators not to remove hard disks
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed to prohibit investigators from removing servers and hard drives from working computers at enterprises.
This was stated by the head of state at a meeting on the investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to “exclude the application in the interest of the investigation of measures leading to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the withdrawal of hard drives from working computers and servers”.
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, "it is enough to take copies, assure them and use them during the investigation."
The head of state added that it is not possible to "create conditions that prevent the continuation of the activity of the enterprise until it is impossible to pay taxes".
Olga Buzova told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV host Olga Buzova admitted that she very much wanted to call her ex-husband - football player Dmitry Tarasov.
Currently, the celebrity is in the United States, where he is engaged in work issues.
Literally the day before Olga visited Las Vegas, after which she decided to post a post on the social network Instagram.
She said she hadn’t gotten married, hadn’t gotten any new tattoos, and hadn’t named her ex-husband with the words that he had ruined her life, even though she wanted to do so.
Buzova said she will remember this trip forever, because she had a great fun.
British actor Robert Hardy has died
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Minister of Magic Cornelius Fage in the screenplay of a series of Harry Potter novels, has died at the age of 92.
This was by the newspaper Independent on Thursday.
The actor’s death was by his relatives.
According to them, he lived "an enormous life, having achieved success in film, theater and television over 70 years of his career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort city of Cheltenham.
In 1959, at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier in The Tragedy of Coriolan.
Hardy also remembered repeatedly playing the roles of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the screenings of Agatha Christie's works about Miss Marple.
For his role in the BBC television drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981) he was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA).
Robert Hardy also played the role of President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Something wasted in the Danish state: Prince Henry, and actually Henri Marie Jean André, Count de Labord, refused to be buried with his worshiping wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the couple has a "golden" wedding, but the couple's agenda is not preparation for the celebrations, but a deadly quarrel.
His Highness renounced the title of prince-consortium, while he rebuked the Queen that he never received the title of king-consortium.
Henry lives in France, although he remains officially the Queen's wife.
Russian Foreign Ministry urges Washington to stop shelling Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry responded to the statements of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The corresponding statement was issued by the Foreign Ministry some time ago.
In its comment, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using cold war stamps, inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats urged the US authorities to stop shelling Russia.
As "Arguments of the Week" wrote on the eve, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organize a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is a conversation about the possibility of a decisive fight
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be steadily moving towards holding the most exciting up to £147 boxing match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in ESPN’s offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked through the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization’s second semi-lightweight champion.
After Garcia’s unanimous victory over former world champion in four weight categories, Erian Broner, on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are among the top five, regardless of weight categories.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, “How are you, champion?
Good luck to you.”
Lomachenko defends his belt in a match with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o’clock on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a potential decisive fight between them would be right.
“I used to be half-light,” Garcia recalled.
“I went up in the category for Bronner [up to 140 pounds], but I’m not that big.
I am small for 140.
I want to go down halfway.
And he needs to get up to the half-lower [up to 135 pounds], and then we will have a match.
This is what fans want.
Let us arrange it for them.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxing needs this match.”
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service as part of the strategy he adheres to for Lomachenko to hold his debut 135 weight fight later this year to schedule a next summer meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knock-outs), who is also interested in battling the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the title of world lightweight champion at the Forum Arena on September 23.
“The fight can be on PPV because all fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, later expressing a willingness to fight on the channel that will offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other name will arouse such interest.
As soon as they are ready...”
Garcia said he believes Lomachenko is a "great boxer" and may visit his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko did not immediately chastise Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the three-weight champion from Riverside looks “very slow, forgive me, Mikey... you were struggling to knock-out.”
Garcia said he focused on showing the strength of the blow and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension growing ahead of their own fight.
“This fight must take place.
No other battle has caused so much interest and conversation.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I was waiting for someone from the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
A number of Moscow streets will be closed for the weekend.
On this weekend, August 5 and 6, traffic will be restricted in the capital on the part of Tverska street from Nastassinsky street to Triumphal Square, as well as traffic on the 1st Tverska-Yamskaya street.
In addition, the passage will be closed on the Leningrad Prospect, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tverska-Yamskaya Street.
On all sections, the blockage will operate on both lanes, reports the information center of the Moscow Department of Transport.
The streets will be closed from midnight on August 5 to 5 a.m. on August 7 due to their improvement.
During the weekend, traffic will also be closed on the Moskvorean area.
There continues the construction of the park “Zaryazie”.
Putin Instructs Prosecutor General to Inspect Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation to inspect the territory of Baikal for facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“I ask the Prosecutor General’s Office to check the Baikal territory for facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities,” Putin said at a meeting on environmental development in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked to take measures if the facts of violations are revealed.
New results for assessing the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to the new medical method of age assessment show that more than 80 percent of respondents were assessed as persons over the age of 18, but not all trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the actual age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensic agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of the test subjects were estimated to be people 18 years or older, and in another 25 cases the forensic agency estimated that the test subjects were “probably a person 18 years or older.”
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was “probably under 18”.
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person causes doubts.
According to Johan Geranson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"We don't see much difference with the statistics for the past months, the numbers are quite relevant," he told The Local.
The high percentage of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and that in 442 cases, “the most likely age of the tested is 18 years or more.”
However, after examining the 581 published results, the newspaper "Svenska Dagbladet" found that in 243 cases a man openly stated that he was 18 this year.
The method of conducting a medical assessment of age, consisting of making x-rays of wisdom teeth and tomography of knee joints and giving them for analysis to dentists and radiologists, has also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Carolina Institute, Claude Marcus, part of whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have gone through puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think we should use the methods of measurement that are being used now.
The biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can’t identify it with certainty, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told Metro.
However, Geranssen of the forensic agency spoke in favor of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, we can say that the risk is wrong to take a child for an adult is small.
We face the greatest risk when a person is soon 18, in which case it is about 10 percent.”
I will consider whether to run for president.
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said he was ready to think about whether to run for the post of President of Russia in the elections in 2018, reports "Interfax".
This statement was a reaction to the request of the inhabitants of the village of Cheremuška of the Buryat region.
During a video conference dedicated to the fire eradication in Buryatia and Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when there are next presidential elections, we all ask you to run again for this post."
“Well, I’ll think, thank you,” the president said in response.
On July 28, Russian President's press secretary Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that Vladimir Putin's pre-election headquarters will be headed by the head of the administration of the President of the Russian Federation Anton Waino.
Peskov called these assumptions "no-founded, hypothetical reasoning."
"As yet there are no headquarters, the creation of headquarters is far away, the election campaign is far away," Peskov said.
"So far this is not on the agenda," Peskov said.
West Virginia Governor Says He's Moving to Another Party
West Virginia Governor, Democratic Party representative Jim Justis announced on Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he is moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," Governor Justis said.
“Today I speak to you with many prayers and many reflections...Today I say to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be useful to you while remaining a Democratic Governor.”
The demonstration exploded with applause.
"So tomorrow I will change my registration to a Republican," Justin said.
“As a coach, I would tell you that time is playing differently.”
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with a 42 percent advantage, and Justin did not support the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justis, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee on Thursday evening issued a statement that “Governor Justin’s transition to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is rather hindering than working to make our country great again.”
“Given only 15 governors and control over the least number of state legislatures in history, the statement of Governor Justin is just another rejection by a party that has no leaders from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,” Republican National Committee spokeswoman Ron McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
A cat named Mr. Beautiful found a home thanks to social networks
A pet in the city of Pittsburgh (North Carolina, USA) had a cat named Mr. Beauty weighing more than 14 kilograms after it became famous thanks to the internet.
This is by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was posted on the pet’s Facebook account asking to find its owner, because “he was obviously fed by someone before.”
In comments, users noted that the expression of the animal’s mouth could become a new mem.
The publication has collected more than 3,2 thousand likes and 15 thousand comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed the desire to shelter Mr. Beauty.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take care of his excess weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, the American told that she already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now he weighs a little more than five.
In July, Reddit users noticed an Australian cat with unusually long legs.
The post with the photo of the animal has collected more than 68 thousand views.
The commentators noted that she could well make a career in the modeling business.
Koe praised Russia's "hearted" apology for doping scandal
International athlete Sebastian Cow on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia in connection with the doping scandal, but repeated that now is not the right time to allow the country to participate in sports competitions again.
The Russian representative of the Federation of Athletics Dmitry Shlechtin said at the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which took place on the eve of the World Athletics Championship, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who were stolen gold and silver medals at the competition.”
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on found evidence of state-funded doping.
“It seemed to me that today’s response, today’s report, was very sincere,” Coe, president of the International Association of Athletic Federations, told reporters.
“The whole council and the whole congress liked ... that the Russian Federation itself acknowledges that it has experienced extremely hot times and now does everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation.”
Cow said he also “liked” that Russia had agreed to its recovery criteria.
“I think it’s been a very constructive day and that we’re moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that it’s not the time to restore Russia to its rights now,” Koe said.
"Over the next few months we will have to do everything we can to fix this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the polluted system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletic Federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the World Championship in athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletic Federations Rune Andersen said on Monday that a number of requirements still must be met for Russia's restoration.
As he told reporters in London after a report made at the board of the International Association of Athletic Federations, drug testing is still not carried out in sufficient volume, and the removed coaches are still quietly doing their job.
Court arrested Ukrainian journalist suspected of state abuse
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) journalist Vasily Muravitsky sent under arrest for two months.
An employee of the Internet edition "Journal Zhytomyr" is suspected of state betrayal by placing his publications on Russian websites and in assault on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a "barbaric policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy has decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The Commandante Borsini patrol vessel entered Libya’s territorial waters to then, together with the country’s navy, stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to start the operation was adopted by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed it with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country.
Opposing the cabinet and based in Tobruk Libyan parliament accused Italy of violating Libya’s sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to counter the Italian ships.
Rome, however, said it did not believe these threats and intended to send another military vessel into Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the Europe-recognized Libyan cabinet, Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics were released in July on the number of illegals arriving in the country from Libya: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The government said the resources to receive migrants were exhausted.

A global failure in the Skype service was recorded today in several countries around the world.
Users on Thursday, August 3, began to massively send complaints to the developers of the program.
Microsoft stressed that experts are already actively working on eliminating the problems faced by residents of Europe and North America, RIA Novosti said.

For some time, users could not receive or send messages.
Two leaders of the national team of Ukraine in athletics suspended from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povh, who specialize in short distance running, were excluded from the composition of the national team of Ukraine for the 2017 World Championship in London.
This is on the website of the Federation of Athletics of the country (FLAU).
This decision was made by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) disciplinary proceedings against athletes.
From the composition of the Ukrainian delegation also excluded coach Zemljak Sergey Basenko.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects the athlete in the use of doping.
Povch - bronze prize winner of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championship, European champion 2010 in the 4 to 100 meters squad, Zemljak - winner of the 2012 European championship in the 4 to 400 meters squad.
The World Athletics Championship in London will take place from August 4 to 13.
How financial rules of football will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not hinder the world record-breaking transfer of Neymar from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris Saint-Germain.
Whatever the consequences may come further on the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain, by UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, in whose authority to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar’s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) only to release the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
The PSG could surely do well to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts of money on players, but they have to balance them against legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after being elected president of UEFA in 2007.
The ex-French footballer believed that clubs that were collapsing into huge debts in their quest for success were essentially cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, the FFP stopped focusing on club debt and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with good potential and then seriously spending to improve the team and create a global brand – became a difficult plan.
During the current three-year assessment period, which is exciting for 2018, clubs could suffer losses of €30 million.
And despite Platini’s shameful removal from the presidency in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive spending.
“Of course, the FFP is alive, and as we move forward, we will tighten the rules,” Andrea Traverso, who controls the FFP at UEFA, told Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG will pay Neymar’s contract at a time, he can distribute that amount over the entire duration of his contract for accounting.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be displayed in the annual report as a cost of €44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of sanctions “FTP” in 2014 to “PSG”, as well as owned Abu Dhabi “Manchester City” were applied tough sanctions.
PSG was fined €60 million ($82 million at that rate), which was later reduced to €20 million, and was ordered to limit the composition of its team in the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may attempt to overthrow its financial inspections by inflating their income at the expense of companies associated with the club’s owners.
Although the Qatar company could sponsor the PSG, but if the amount of funding was considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the amount of financing of the PSG by the Tourism Administration of Qatar was inflated.
It was that part of Neymar's earnings in the PSG could come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But the PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will be the world championship ambassador, and such a manoeuvre could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will keep an even closer eye on any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As on Thursday, persons familiar with the situation, UEFA did not have preliminary discussions with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
They communicated with the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the position of the PSG.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros of profit with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The report for the last financial year has not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a favorable ground for sponsorship deals, sales of attributes and T-shirts with the team’s logo.
The club is expected to increase turnover by at least 30 percent as a result of hiring a new player.
Undoubtedly upset by the departure of one of the best players, the Spanish league tried to hinder Neymar's transfer, saying that the PSG would disrupt the financial fair play.
“This is an obvious case of ‘financial doping’, with the club and the state,” La Liga President Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that the final owner of the PSG is Qatar.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports magnate, shares La Liga’s doubts about the club’s state funding.
"It's all the consequences of equity participation, and it has completely changed the landscape of football over the past fifteen years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“When a club belongs to a country, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to observe financial fair play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and place of the oath shall be determined by the President.
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation, will be determined by the president - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law developed by the State Duma committee on legislation and state construction.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the procedure for sworn-in in the law.
Children under the age of 18 will be released from the solemn oath, as well as those who are incapable, according to the amendments to the draft law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation" (is at the disposal of "Izvestia"), which the committee will consider before the second reading on its meeting on July 11.
The idea of introducing an oath when obtaining Russian citizenship instead of formal signing documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on June 6 during a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
Deputies formed this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill, which provides for the abolition of the decision on granting citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted for a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public appeals to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (Article 2 of Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for the kidnapping of a plane, train or water transport, but only if this act is connected with terrorism (Article 4 of Article 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, its logic was this: when issuing documents for citizenship, a person signs under a promise to comply with the Russian legislation - taking the path of extremism, he breaks this promise.
The bill was submitted to the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev (“United Russia”), Gennady Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov (“Fair Russia”) and the speaker of the DG Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for second reading, but now it has been revised again.
The order of the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians planned to describe the procedure directly in the law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation", stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the state emblem and flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where the emblem of the Russian Federation can be placed is regulated by the corresponding federal constitutional law.
They include courts, cabinets of heads of state bodies of subjects, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Probably, it could also be cracks.
Those who wish to obtain Russian citizenship will take a solemn oath after officials check their documents.
But the Russian passport will only be obtained after the oath, it follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath must precede the signing of the decree.
Russia will be sworn in at the age of 18, not at the age of 14.
It is preserved that those who are incapable or limited in capacity, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the text of the oath, will be released from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt "other persons" from this procedure.
Also in the updated bill prescribed a special procedure for admission in Russian citizens of residents of Ukraine, who are considered natives of the Russian language.
They will have to officially give up Ukrainian citizenship by submitting a corresponding application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarially certified copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
A renunciation of “foreign” citizenship, as is now the case, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons beyond the person”.
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among them the first deputy speaker of the DG Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, it is simply impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for a decision on their fate regarding the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the head of the Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarified that the restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have written renounced "other" citizenship and handed down the previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but "for reasons not dependent on him" he did not cease to be considered a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from holding positions in the municipal service, being employed in facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or residence permit of another country cannot become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force from 1 September 2017, by that time the necessary legal acts should be prepared.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in “The Hot American Summer” and “The Detective Society”
The current iteration of history nostalgically reminds us at the same time of the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; of the grand age in the 90s (approximately at the time when the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Shawalter made the comedy sketch "State" for MTV); and of itself - that is, of 2001 before her stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Rudd moved to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time an elevation and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems an anachronism.
"The first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of the absurd humor (including the original story of the speaking bank of vegetables, which was pronounced by H. John Benjamin).
The result is doubled by the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached adulthood; thus the inability to return to becomes part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", where adults played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more systematic and includes reefs from the Stalker films of the 90s such as "Hands swinging the cradle".
In one episode, the character gets an Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991".
Many story moves are the same.
Good-hearted Coupe (Schoolter), now a writer, has still not achieved reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet broken up with his virginity.
And there’s still a crazy and sinister conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Shawalter), who is now being instigated by George W. Bush the Elder (a tested parody by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of a franchise is withdrawal from it.
It’s fun to see ever-young Rudd singing Matt Dillon’s song from “The Lonely”, whose character, former big man Andy, now looks old-fashioned.
To bring this franchise success could random madness in the spirit of the type of recursive series "Seven Up", until it reaches what, in my opinion, would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where in the final scene the entire company would go to the cinema for the premiere of the film "Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon turns to a different type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from the "Americans", the "Explosive Blonde" or even the "Blitz" with her images of the struggle of the East and the West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gateswood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Riz Thomas, depicts a television film: a Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The main roles – who saw the life of Gregor and the idealist Joseph – are played by Florin Piersique Jr. and Corneliu Ulicich, and their dialogues in English were voiced by Channing Tatum (he is an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It is a brilliant idea.
But only an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (polices spend time watching a chess match like Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the scenes - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - makes it interesting to play "guess the voice".
But "Comrade Detective" so holds for the authenticity of the nasty propaganda drama - there is even a killer in the mask of Ronald Reagan - that often looks like it.
Six long episodes are lengthy, and funny is not very often.
If it were to be shortened, the "Comrade Detective" could have better coped with his satire in the spirit of agit-prop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the U.S. Embassy, there are two fat men sitting in the vestibule, swallowing a bunch of hamburgers.
To the imaginary communist viewer, this image tells us that Western culture is capable of making anything into an embryo.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: We do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund of the match for the Super Cup of Russia between "Spartak" and "Lokomotiv" will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergey Pradkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that there are almost no tickets left for the match at the moment.
The match "Spartak" - "Locomotive" will be held on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As noted by TASS, "Spartak" is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and "Locomotive" is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young men cleaned a furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
Recently, a 37-year-old man who owns a furniture company appealed to the police.
The man claimed that he stole expensive tools from the workshop, which caused serious damage to his production.
The mine of thieves became tools with a total cost of almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulic machine, a swimmer.
Order guards began the search for the criminals and soon came to the inhabitants of the Blagoveshchensky district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, the accomplices entered the territory of the enterprise, broke the entrance door and brought out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment the first car service.
A theft case has already been opened against them, and law enforcers managed to return only a part of the stolen instruments to the legitimate owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words about relations between Russia and the United States
The United States and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This was stated by State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert in response to the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the relations between the two countries.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that, by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared Russia a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a "low level", but noted that it is necessary to look for "area for interaction".
“Look at the ceasefire in southwestern Syria, which has been observed for almost a month.”
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," the diplomat said.
At the same time, the representative of the Foreign Ministry refused to comment on the statement of the Russian prime minister that the sanctions are equivalent to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea was signed by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday.
At the same time, he acknowledged that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior grows roses from quartz and amethyst
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has supplemented the collections Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
In them appeared five new rings and three columns-chocks on barley tapes.
In the line of Rose Dior Pré Catelan released two new rings and crowns of amethysts, pink quartz and diamonds, made in the technique of glypsy (hand carving on stone) and pawa and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie, Victor de Castellan, was inspired by the roses grown in his Granville estate by fashion designer Christian Dior, and the Paris Gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catalon.
Trump found the culprits of deteriorating relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed sharp criticism of members of Congress.
According to the US leader, their actions have led to the deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
“You can thank Congress, these same people can’t even give us medicine,” he tweeted.
On the eve, Donald Trump signed the law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently spread a statement by the president, in which he pointed out that the law will not allow the United States to conclude profitable deals and will further bring Russia, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refuses to buy Ukrainian Sberbank
The Belarusian entrepreneur Viktor Prokopiya has withdrawn from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) the application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention of “concentrating on our other planned investments and projects we are working on.”
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step will be "the best investment of time", despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopen became the main contender for the purchase of a division of the Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU in July rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortium Grigoriy Guseljnikov and the Belarusian company Saida Guceriyev.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial organization - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - became Sberbank.
Novak named the cause of the blackout in Crimea
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation named the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
This was explained by the head of the Ministry Alexander Novak.
According to him, the peninsula remained without electricity due to a road accident on the territory of the Krasnodar Territory.
The truck struck the power transmission line, as a result of which the Cuban and related Crimean networks were disconnected.
Electricity failures in major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Experts resolved the problem within hours.
It was initially that the cause of the blackout could have been abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have shunned rumors of a possible rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain relentless, leaving interest rates unchanged amid rising pressure on household incomes.
Specialists in the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with a result of 6 to 2 forining rates at 0.25%, with fewer committee members voting in favour this month because weak economic growth weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3% in autumn.
However, the bank has warned that interest rate increases in the next few years will be necessary to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said that borrowing costs will likely have to rise stronger than expected in the financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to abandon part of the huge package of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will shut down the emergency financing plan under which it provides cheap loans to banks, although it said it would now have to provide another £15 billion under that plan – up to £115 billion.
In a report on interest rate decisions, the bank said: “According to MPC’s primary forecasts, gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the near future remains slow, while the pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption.”
On interest rates, he reiterated that “some tightening of fiscal policy” would be needed to halt inflation, “somewhat more” than the markets expect.
Currently, markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all the raises would be “progressive” and “limited.”
The bank’s forecasts for this and next year are lower than the forecasts made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7% respectively.
The bank left unchanged its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 percent to $1.31 and 0.4 percent to €1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent disappointing growth indicators weakened the increased expectation of a rise; GDP then increased by 0.3% in the second quarter versus 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth, apparently, will remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank’s latest inflation report has given little reason to rejoice for households hit by high inflation and slight wage increases: the bank says the pressure will increase before it decreases.
The bank added that financial policy "cannot prevent" earnings boom over the next few years, but expects wages to recover "significantly" by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also on the rise as a result of the growing demand for British goods due to the low exchange rate of the pound, which compensates for part of the lower consumer spending.
The decision was made a year after rates were reduced to 0.25% last August following the shocking results of the referendum on the issue of leaving the European Union, which caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates it will probably take four years to fully impact prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its final interest rate decision, there was noise around the alleged rate hike as inflation increased the pressure on households already under heavy pressure: three members of the expert committee asked to raise interest rates to 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank, this drop was expected and will again be offset in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate compared to the planned 2% is entirely a result of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montley, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market appears to be even more competitive again as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good end of the year.
The market looks favorable for those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as loan refinancing, often with the possibility of no commission, as well as with a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.”
The state health service will prescribe the controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will get access to a “revolutionary” drug for HIV prevention after a battle in the High Court over funding the drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposure HIV prevention (PREP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in individuals at risk by an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by the health service over an initial three-year trial period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal backed a High Court ruling last year claiming that the National Health Service had the ability to pay the PrEP despite her claims that it should be funded by the local authorities.
The move, which was announced on Thursday, was called a “most important innovation” by the president of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National Agency for AIDS Control (NAT) called it a “turning point.”
Before the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, venereal clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start registering people, and even more clinics will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
As studies have shown, PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PrEP before sex in the human body a sufficient amount of certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender men and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensers will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals whose partners are unknown if their HIV status is constrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and attributed to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereal dispensary participating in the program.
The program will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England signed a contract this week after an international tender for the drug.
The study is designed to evaluate all the possibilities of PrEP through the collection of clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its digestibility and its use on a large scale.
“This key innovation should complement and strengthen the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in combating one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National Agency for AIDS Control), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is properly targeted at people in need and at risk, gives the opportunity to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV, thanks to this study conducted in England on behalf of the National Health Service, will have access to a new opportunity-opening remedy, the use of which a person can control themselves without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to improving many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “Now the first thing we need to do is make sure that the trial quickly spreads across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is forgotten.
Now that we are provided with the experimental PrEP drug, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk for HIV.”
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “We very much welcome the start of the PrEP test, it was very late due to months of delays and government wires.”
The data shows how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the trial be deployed across the country as soon as possible to protect people at risk for HIV and to move us one step further towards stopping the spread of HIV in society.
World Congress of the Tatars adopted a resolution on the support of the treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatar Congress (WTC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance ofining the position of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a positively established form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the whole Tatar people".
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, it "has played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole".
On July 24, 2007, the agreement between Moscow and Kazan was signed for 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and to retain the name of the position of the head of the region.
Tatarstan is the only federal entity that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "president".
In Russia, there are difficulties in obtaining international driving licenses
GIBDD units are experiencing a shortage of International Driving Permit (IDP).
In order to obtain such rights, you have to wait in line for several weeks, which has become a real problem for holidaymakers wishing to go on holiday abroad on their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licenses remains controversial.
The IMU was introduced to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, as the information in it is explained in five languages.
Requirements to international rights are recorded in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as such.
However, in fact, everything depends on specific police officers or rental offices: some require an IMU, and someone has enough national rights.
To be insured, drivers still get international rights, but it is worth considering that in the countries that have not ratified the convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or IMU.
Now there is a problem with the forms in almost all units of the GIBDD, reports "Kommersant", conducting a study in a number of regions.
Thus, in Moscow, in the units of the UGIBDD, the billboards are simply not issued, the forms are lacking for four months.
You can sign up for the reception on the website of public services, but there the line has already stretched until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get an IMU "for technical reasons", without entering into details, in the Samara region, they honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation exists in other cities.
With the problem have already faced many Moscowis, in social networks more and more often appear such messages:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why in Moscow can not get international rights?"
It’s right, because in all departments of the GIBD the forms have ended.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question to knowledgeable people!"
International rights need to be acquired urgently.
In Moscow, the whole time is scored far ahead, at the site, coupons are not issued at all (there is a button, but the coupons cannot be given).
Apparently, the public service portal shows that in the SPB time is free before FIG.
Has anyone tried in another city?
Will it work?
As explained by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for the forms of international driving licenses have changed, so the subdivisions of the State Auto Inspection are delivered new forms.
This may be associated with a deficit, although it is unclear what changes are in question, this was not previously.
The blank is purchased by the Special Purpose Center in the field of road safety (CSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supplied to the units of the GIBDD.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with JSC "Goznak": in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand IMU forms were manufactured, in 2016 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with LLC "First Printed Court" to manufacture 70 thousand forms.
There is a version that the CSN simply did not have time to hold the tender on time, which caused a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: due to the crisis, many people began to travel independently not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there, it is unclear to the end, so people are reinsured, and therefore there has been an agitating demand for international "shorts".
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to take an exam to confirm their qualifications.
This is the proposal made by Minecraft.
The International Driving Permit (IDP) of the new model is valid from 31 May 2011.
Ukrainian Justice Minister refuses to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko said he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge to Crimea.
About it on Friday, August 4, he said in an interview to the portal "Obzorzovatel".
No self-respecting international company will even put a bullet or a hook there, because it risks losing its business in the territory of the EU, the United States, Japan - in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia regarding the Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, the prospects of this project are actually not," Petrenko said.
He added that he believes Russia is unable to implement a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build even less large-scale facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums have already begun to be destroyed.
"Therefore, I believe, the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so short-sighted to join this project," he said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the automobile arch of the Crimean bridge.
On the shore of Kerch, the extensive assembly of the motorway arch of the Crimean bridge has been completed: its bridge is closed at an altitude of 45 meters from the basis of the construction.
"At the same time, the bridge builders have prepared for the installation of a railway arch on the farvater supports," the project information center said.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility is ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and Krasnodar Territory.
Spanish official fired after not working for 10 years
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the chief of the Spanish official, Carlos Recio, possess?
Permanent walk extended for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio has been fired.
Not his immediate boss.
There is nothing in the world of bureaucrats.
They seem to have long been accustomed to all the "servants of the people" jokes.
And, nevertheless, officials are always able to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time the sensation came from Spain.
There, an employee of the archives of Valencia, Carles Rezo, managed to not go to work for ten years.
He was regularly paid a salary.
And all solid – 50 thousand euros per year.
And now Mr. Recio’s “strange times” are over.
He was dismissed by the decision of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
During the investigation it turned out that the vicious walker came to the office at 07:00 every working morning to sign up in the electronic system.
He immediately went home.
Once again he appeared at the workplace at 4 p.m. to reiterate in the system that he left.
And so 10 years.
It also became known that all of his free time the walker devoted to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia are thinking about how to punish the immediate chief of Mr. Rezo, who could not but know how to “work actively” at his workplace his subordinate.
The judges are offered to protect from the presidents
The Presidential Council on Human Rights (CPHR) on behalf of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch of power.
The CPI proposes to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts and introduce their eligibility.
For the courts of appeal and cassation instances, the SPL wants to introduce special districts that will not be attached to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also submit its proposals within the presidential mandate.
The CPJ has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of the Russian judiciary.
This work was carried out on the order of Vladimir Putin from January 3, 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with members of the council.
At the meeting with the members of the council on 8 December 2016, individual cases of judicial arbitration, as well as problems of public control in places of imprisonment of citizens were discussed (see "Ъ" of 9 December).
The result of the work of the CPJ was 25 proposals, which concern both the issues of ensuring the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights activists is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to increase the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the position of a judge successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judge community, then the chairman of the court, in the opinion of the CPJ, should present him for appointment, without having the right to refuse, as this is permitted now by the law.
It is also proposed to deprive the chairman of the right to distribute cases for consideration between judges.
To do this, experts allow, can specially written computer program.
The Chairman has no right to "predetermine the results of the qualification of the judge, to initiate his disciplinary responsibility, to make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments".
At the same time, the presidential council considers it necessary to move to the "election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves" and "allocate their powers for a comparatively short period with mandatory rotation".
Currently, all Chairmen of courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the President on the proposal of the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the CPI proposes to organize appeal and cassation in courts of general jurisdiction in a new way.
Now their structure is linked to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
It is necessary to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts.
The experts are based on the practice of arbitration courts.
There are "judicial districts" that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee at the expense of this greater independence from regional officials who are difficult to use the "telephone right".
The CPJ proposes that the world judges be strengthened by people’s seats to consider with their participation some “categories of civil and administrative cases”.
For example, deprivation of parental rights, restoration at work, protection of honor and dignity, deprivation of driving licenses, etc.
"These are only our proposals," explained "Ъ" member of the SPC, the retired judge of the Constitutional Court, Tamara Morshchakov.
She also recalled that the mandate of the president applied not only to the Supreme Court, but also to the Supreme Court, which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
Time for the execution of the assignment by the Armed Forces (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation) is still there.
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of the judiciary is ensured in the Russian Federation, the Chairman of the Armed Forces Vyacheslav Lebedev must before September 1.
Living a High Life: A Half Floor and Delicious Design Techniques Turn This Small Apartment In Earl's Court Into A Spatial Home
Joanne Lee, a former real estate bankier, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a cute typical Queen Anne house, and in favor of the new design says that Joan has not picked up her things and has not moved again.
“I previously lived with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger area,” says Joan.
“I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earl’s Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered the price the same day.”
From the moment of the first view, the apartment with an area of 1000 square feet has undergone a complete reconstruction.
It was originally a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout – to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to get the most out of the generous height of the ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands,” she said.
For this purpose, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill’s Duck & Shed architectural and design studio to use 12.5-foot ceilings and create a home that would not only be a successful project, but would fit Joan’s life.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms above each other, so the architectural task was to create a half-floor where you could stand in full height.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the brief.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We needed to arrange the rooms so that they were one above the other and didn’t have to bend.
It was necessary not just to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they are at the right height and allow the space to be used from above and below.”
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms one above the other in the dedicated space - and a lot more interesting.
From the ground floor through the vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" is a view of the elegant living room below.
Mirror furniture with gold finish, silver accents and vintage lighting devices from Serzh Muya set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacularity, space and light.
A short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protective panel looks like a window into another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinets serve to store all Joan’s dishes.
To create a sense of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can overwhelm the kitchen when it is not used.
There is nothing new in the kitchen.
The singularity of this kitchen is that it is a shifting upward door, like in a garage.
“Here was engaged engineering art,” Erfan tells us about a wooden-fiber shield door armored with steel.
“It’s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily.”
Through the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“Ultimately, the floor area is exactly what you’re going to sell, that is, what your property is valued by,” Erfan says.
“Roughly speaking, the real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on the area of the sexes.”
Here they were able to increase the floor area, using high-quality materials that give the space a shade of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with the home,” Erfan says.
“No one falls in love with electrical wiring in the walls.
It’s important, but it doesn’t touch the strings of our hearts.”
This serves as a testimony to the fact that due to good design and increased metering the apartment can turn from something ordinary to something stunning.
In fact, like Joan, you can choose to stay.
The Government approved the creation of a Commission on Cultural Policy

G20 inflation drops to eight-year low
The growth of consumer prices in the countries of the G20 fell to the lowest in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal with reference to data of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2% - lower values were recorded in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat a 0.1% decrease in the consumer price index in Russia.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The target of inflation in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been reached - according to the version of this department, the figure is 4%.
Putin warns against illegal cutting of Baikal taiga
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on environmental development of the Baikal natural territory warned against illegal deforestation.
During the event, Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy noted that the bill had been prepared earlier.
It allows for forest cutting during the fire-fighting, and the government plans to adopt it in the autumn.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of cutting "not cut out everything in a row."
Donskoy noted that this bill implies control by the Ministry of Emergencies and supervisory agencies.
Media: soldiers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces secretly from the command are negotiating with the militias of Donbass
On the line of armed confrontation in the Donbass established regular telephone communication.
Fighters of the opposing parties constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known in the headquarters.
The soldiers of the armed forces of Ukraine and the militias of the Donbass established communication on cell phones secretly from their high command.
This is on August 4 "Strana.ua" with reference to the participants of the military operation in the Donbass.
According to the newspaper, the commanders of the units know the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on the phone every day.
Communication is not everyday at all: the commanders are trying to reach some "tactical arrangements".
Often, as a result of such talks, a ceasefire is concluded on a certain part of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when congratulations on birthday one or another officer received from outside the front line, from his formal enemy.
Fighters of the Ukrainian armed forces and militias of the DPR and LPR have been sitting in barracks on the border line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine began a combat operation against the Donbass.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs outraged the blocking of statements of the UN Security Council about attacks on the Russian embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives who block UN Security Council statements in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian embassy in Syria.
This is by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
On August 2, the territory of the Russian embassy in Damascus, for the third time in a month, was subjected to mortar shelling by terrorists of the groups Haiat Tahrir Ash-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in the Russian Federation) and Faylak Ar-Rahman.
Taking into account that the international community unanimously qualifies Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for counteraction to this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, of course, that Nusra attacks should meet universal unconditional and decisive condemnation, and in the assessments of outbursts against diplomatic missions should be no ambiguity."
“For the third time in a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of objections, covering up with the arguments of the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the Russian Federation’s proposal to adopt a standard short draft of the Security Council statement for the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital.”
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of these delegations.
“The most disappointing thing is that the Security Council’s failure to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them a sense of impunity,” the Foreign Ministry said, adding that “we would not like these barbarians to be convinced that someone in the Security Council is on their side.”
Vladimir Putin proposes to limit the number of unplanned business inspections
Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East said that the number of unplanned inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the number of planned, and also said the need to limit the period of inspections to ten days.
"Unplanned inspections are carried out, as a rule, without appropriate agreement with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% is agreed with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes independently," the president said.
Vladimir Putin also said that it is necessary to prohibit investigators from removing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should get the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will bring a certain positive to the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity or related to violation of the law in the sphere of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
Due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is increasing.
In May, on the order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, as a result of which it was revealed that in fact there was a replacement of scheduled checks by unplanned (the share of those who encountered them grew from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutor (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raids (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as checks on applications of citizens (growth from 15% to 19,5%) and administrative investigations (10.8% to 15,5%).
More details about the business checks in the material "O" "To small business went from the other side".
Brothers Fight for $500 Million Real Estate Empire
Two brothers fight for one of Victoria’s largest empires in real estate trade worth more than $500 million – forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin de Luthies lives in Turak Palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court for the division of possessions and assets.
Paul wants to quit the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in a fierce dispute over the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought a Smith Street store in 1973 in Collingwood.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the list of possessions of the De Luthies family now includes office buildings, buildings in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and in Mount Buller, and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin – whom Paul describes as the “main driving force and dominant personality” of the De Luthies family – owns about two-thirds of the company’s assets, while Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, this means that Colin’s property is 316 million, and Paul’s – 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling stone for Paul.
"The division proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts to reconcile, the first hearing in the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business – from which Paul believes Colin has excluded him.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some objects.
In the testimony Colin gave at the beginning of the trial, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian roots make me consider seven a top priority,” he wrote.
Judicial costs are growing like a snowball: the case includes hundreds of pages of testimony, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer; both sides have attracted the most famous lawyers, including the royal lawyer Alan Myers, and the finest strutters.
Ms. De Luthies and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; from the late 1950s they run dairy bars and gastronomies, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last classes of school, and Paul was a boy then (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their possessions to their sons without conflict.
"Luigi has often told me that he doesn't want the brothers to go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; Colina says Mark earned $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “unhappy with the financial conditions of their department.”
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to Eddie McGuire's 2015 biography, the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media on Friday contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
Colin only replied with a text message saying that since the case had not yet been considered in court, "I really have nothing to say."
“I’m very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a lawsuit against me and shake the name of our family in court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in his testimony that he was trying to satisfy his brother’s demands.
“Our father’t want to see Paul and I argue in court,” he said, adding that “he’s still hoping for a solution to the conflict.”
On Friday, that hope seemed to have dissipated.
"The decision on our case will soon be made by the court," Colin wrote.
The new head of the Trump apparatus plans to limit the access of information to the president.
Others tried and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly will really do it.
In that case, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new head of the White House apparatus plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the boss in a calmer state.
This is by Josh Dawsey.
“At a meeting held by the new White House chief of staff John F. Kelly with the chief of staff on his first working day, he pointed out the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: the poor channels of information to the president.”
Kelly told staff that the information should go through him—in paper or through briefings—because the president would be better off making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly’s diagnosis is perfectly true, but others have already failed in trying to calm Trump by tracking information coming to him.
President Trump’s relationship with television developed several decades ago – and now that he is in the White House, his habit of watching television is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by unfair campaign coverage, it was helpful to show him that he was getting fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded,” Sam Nanberg, a former election staff adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmery wrote in Politico that “according to six former members of the electoral staff, in order to keep Trump’s habit of writing on Twitter under control, it was necessary to ensure that there was a constant stream of praise in the information coming to him personally.”
well well .
But the idea that Trump’s habit of writing on Twitter has ever been “under control” is just ridiculous.
Per these members of the electoral staff know something we don’t know—for example, that without them, Trump’s tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never find out about tweets that Trump has not published.
If his employees saved him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one ever managed to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into competing factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by providing Trump with material – reliable or not – that supports their views.
"Politico" - just about this story - wrote in May about the tendency of advisors to constantly submit to the president questionable information.
Here is an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Trump’s current and former employees say that Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks of information, and will not calm down until he finds who was behind them.
That’s what happened in late February, when someone submitted to the president an article from GotNews.com, the website of Charles K. Johnson’s internet provocator, in which the deputy chief of the apparatus, Katie Wells, was accused of “staying behind a series of leaks” in the White House.
It doesn’t matter if Johnson is forever mocked on Twitter for his aggressive behavior, whether he didn’t present specific facts, or if in the past he launched false accusations and then rejected them.
Trump read the article and asked the staff about Wales.”
Goldmeier adds that then-chief Rains Pribus and secretary Rob Porter "tried to build a system to control the flow of papers Trump receives and document them."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may be a more efficient manager than Pribus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still fighting for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly’s task very difficult.
Tyumen Prosecutor's Office fights with HIV dissident
The Prosecutor’s Office challenged the ruling of the Kalininsky district court in Tyumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local resident, whose young daughter died from HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother is a HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility in connection with the reconciliation with the victim's father.
The Prosecutor’s Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished in order not to create a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against the resident of Tyumen was initiated under part 1 of article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (causing death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died from HIV-infection 4B stage.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the mother is HIV-infected.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that there is no HIV infection," the Prosecutor's Office of the Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case entered the Kalininsky district court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided on its termination.
The petition was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that he "forgave his wife, has no claims to her, she smoothed the damage and apologized."
The Prosecutor’s Office did not agree with the court’s decision and filed an appeal, demanding to cancel the decision on the termination of the case and send it for a new consideration.
The girl died, and it is impossible to smooth out the damage caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection,” the prosecutor’s office said.
According to the supervisory authority, she should be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents will follow her example.
As told in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children with HIV do not receive medical care due to the refusal of their parents.
"And this situation has already improved - in the year of the work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children from HIV, changed their mind - allowed to conduct a diagnosis, began to take drugs," - told the spokeswoman of the AIDS Center Elena Loseva.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents in a legislative way, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers do not let them be examined, hide, escape with children from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV dissidents
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first in Russia study of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medicines.
Doctors and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and see their spread as a serious threat.
A terrible photo session, which ended in tragedy, occurred on Thursday, August 3, at Grechany railway station in Khmelnitsk.
A fun company of drunk young people walked over the bridge over the railways, where a freight train was just standing.
One of the friends had the idea to make an impressive selfie on the roof of the car, the fact of the communication department of the police in the Khmelnitsk region.
The boy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but because of his carelessness stuck onto the power line and immediately got hit by electricity.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station's controller, who immediately called for an "emergency".
Before the arrival of doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnitsk regional clinical hospital.
The man was diagnosed with body burns of 1-2 degrees.
His condition is now assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement officials recall that in recent years, extreme selfies on roofs of multi-storey buildings, bridges, moving transportation are becoming increasingly popular.
Police urge people to be vigilant and not allow such photoshoots, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists Have Admitted Oceans on Ancient Venus
There may have been oceans on Venus.
This is what French scientists have suggested.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that Venus at the beginning of its history formed oceans, in which there was 10% more water than it is now on Earth.
Earlier, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean 4 billion years ago could have existed on Mars.
Foreign experts in the course of their research concluded that the water object was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.

Louna is one of the most popular bands on the Russian rock scene.
The group was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group several times won in different nominations of the hit-parade "Devil Duchy".
The Gypsies overcame the river and returned to the "millionaire street"
Some of West Midland’s wealthiest homeowners are once again in conflict with the determined Gypsies who have overcome the municipality’s river to re-occupy the field next to their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich street Solihalla, which was jokingly called "millionaire street".
Having brought with them horses, babies and many houses on wheels, they returned after being expelled no later than in May, and they were not hindered by a pit excavated by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in the defensive structures and dragged its vehicles through the site, which was left unfocused to leave room for the trail.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihalla, saying it was “unable to solve the problem.”
An anonymous local resident said: “They came here on Monday evening after being driven out of Bentley Heath, where they were throwing stones at passers.”
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act, because they are absolutely incapable of solving this problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were expelled, and here they came back again.
More Roma came last night, and maybe even more today.
“The Birmingham municipality knows how to solve this problem, they are getting long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
“I live on the street and I don’t like that I’m still paying municipal taxes, and the municipality can’t even end it.”
One local resident, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: “It’s funny, we just saw these Gypsies leave the last time, and please, this attack continues.”
This time they became more, and we even saw a horse riding on the lawn.”
A spokesman for the municipality of Solihalla said: “We are aware of the illegal camp on the ground near the Street Street Road and we are cooperating with Solihalla police; we are taking the necessary legal action to evacuate them as soon as possible.”
To help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police by phone 101.
This allows us to make an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea to activate champagne wine factory "New World"
GUP of the Republic of Crimea "Fabric of Champagne Wines "New World" is decided to share, transforming into the OJSC "Fabric of Champagne Wines "New World"", follows from the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anjukhina.
100% of the shares of the company will remain in state ownership of Crimea.
The charter capital of the joint-stock company will amount to 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Crimean Ministry of Agriculture stated that if there are no funds for the modernization of the enterprise in the next three years, there will be a threat of stopping the plant.
The expenditure of the main assets in the enterprise is about 60-70%.
For the modernization of the enterprise it is necessary 1.2 billion rubles. due to the features of the organizational and legal form it is obliged to give 50% of the profit in the budget income.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
“Receiving money from the owner is problematic, talking about attracting borrowed funds from large credit organizations is difficult,” Sergey Petelin, deputy head of the Crimean agriculture ministry, said in April.
The parliament of Crimea included the company in the forecast plan of privatization for 2017.
It was proposed to carry out its stockpiling and to be put up for auction.
The source of "Interfax" in the authorities of Crimea estimated the possible cost of the sale of the enterprise in $ 40 million, investments of the investor in modernization - in another $ 30 million.
"New World" in 2016 increased the production of playful wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 - to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, New World intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn as a factory for the production of wine in the New World estate acquired by him.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third classmen destroyed more than 40 tombs
Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Nizhny Novgorod region established the identities of citizens who destroyed 46 tombs at the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers were third-class students.
The first statement that the graveyards were damaged by unknown persons came to the Ombudsman of the Russian Federation for the Lyskovsky district on June 27.
In total, 24 people appealed to the police.
A criminal case was initiated under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or profanation of burial places".
According to the results of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, they turned out to be two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
Minors told the police that they were interested in watching the monuments fall, which prompted them to hooliganism.
Preventive measures are carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone against NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs that own rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue working unless they comply with the new rules governing their activities.
“If non-governmental organizations do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities,” Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily Stampa.
Minnit's warning came the day after Italian authorities seized a ship owned by the German humanitarian organization "Jugend Rettet" on suspicion that its crew actually cooperated with human traffickers and facilitated illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which worked for only a year, declined to comment on the substance of the detailed charges raised against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartozio.
"For us, saving human lives is and will remain the highest priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue our activities in the search and rescue zone right now," the organization said in a statement.
"We will be able to assess all the allegations raised now only after we have gathered all the information and can evaluate the situation."
Italian authorities have been monitoring Juventus’s vessel, which belongs to Juventus Rettet, since October.
His crew is suspected of taking migrants on board with lifeboats that human traffickers sent directly to them and allowing smugglers to leave along with boats they could reuse.
At least one such encounter is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the charges, which were published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the instructions of the Italian coastal authorities, which control rescue operations in the area, more for humanitarian sake than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct implies, mainly, that vessels such as Juventus will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, the Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary, but acceptable, provided they do not entail any “significant changes or obstacles” to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in the recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are yielding fruit.
“In recent days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He announced plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict.
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently markedly intensified their policy in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow participated delegations of the opposing Libyan sides.
The head of the Russian contact group on the internal settlement of Libya at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the assistant of the head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dengov told "Ъ", what goals Moscow pursues in this region and on whom it is betting.
Almost nothing is known about the Libya contact group you are leading.
Here, let’s say, the contact group on Ukraine – everyone knows about it.
Here is the curtain of secret.
What exactly do you do, what goals do you pursue?
The contact group was created at the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Deputy of the Duma from Chechnya).
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanik Cheborarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "Ъ").
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma was created, and our work was supported by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did it happen that it was you who led it?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I was asked to lead the group.
Our activities were not limited to the liberation of sailors from the Chebotarev Mechanic.
We managed to establish contacts with representatives of all the major groups facing each other in the Libyan conflict – both from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government headed by Faiz Sarrazh is based) and Tobruk (the parliamentary residence that opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice Prime Minister of Libya - "Ъ"), we managed to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to create a contact group in order to use these contacts more effectively.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize in particular that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, we are in dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
There are currently five people in the contact group.
Among them are people with experience working in force structures, including in the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to introduce a group of specialists for the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of RAS.
No one of our employees is permanently in Libya, this is not necessary yet.
There are now Russian military advisors and instructors in Libya.
If so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the talk and publication about this does not correspond to reality.
But in your contact group former military members are ...
And their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or such cities closed up to a certain point for us, such as Misrata (where militia units are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and markedly intensified in subsequent years).
We arrived in Missouri in January of this year.
We were frightened, they said that there were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to evaluate the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what is the role of Islamists.
In Misrata we met with all the representatives of the units that were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016 this city on the Mediterranean coast was captured by the militants of the banned in Russia “Islamic State” – “Ъ”).
We wanted to look at them, get acquainted with these people, check the information that they played a decisive role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, and not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And to what conclusion have you come?
Has the Islamic State defeated Haftar in Libya?
This was not he doing.
Haftar conducted operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And with ISIL in Sirte struggled structures subordinated to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they came - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, the Duma, the Foreign Ministry and the Rosgard.
As we understood, you are in all the Libyan regions and you probably imagine the mood of the local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections reached by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj in Paris in late July?
Or again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, agreements will be broken, hostilities will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
For us, a good signal was the fact that Sarage and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the past, the two leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
As for Russia’s position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe in it.
We faced this situation when we were in Missouri, and Haftar was on board the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov on that day.
It was coincidence.
But in Misrata they did not believe in coincidence.
We were told, “You are probably very brave people who came to us today.”
But our task is to show that we are not just supporting Haftar, we are in dialogue with all key parties in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar talked.
Does the fact that he studied twice in the USSR facilitate understanding with Russian partners on a human, emotional level?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
If he knows Russian, he is relatively good.
But what he learned from us, of course, facilitates the dialogue with him.
And not just with him.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Missouri, we meet generals who studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
They speak Russian very well.
And they stretch to Russia, to some extent feel nostalgia for it.
Is it possible to lift the arms embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in Russian arms supplies?
They are interested, of course, but, as I said, we are not on one side in this conflict and we would not want to arm some at the expense of others.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
As for the arms embargo, there are constant calls from the Libyans that Russia should somehow contribute to its lifting.
Currently, the process of drafting a constitution is actively progressing in Libya.
We hope that the parties will come to compromises and internal consensus.
Then elections should be held, as was discussed at the meeting between Sarajevo and Haftar.
If elections are held and the legitimate authority is finally elected (and now none of the parties has such status), then the issue of lifting the arms embargo can be raised in the UN Security Council.
To raise this question now is meaningless and dangerous, it will only lead to the escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees floating from Libya, feels abandoned to the fate of its EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the possibility that Haftar’s troops will take control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers sending immigrants to Europe?
Very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need the support of Russia, because Moscow is in dialogue simultaneously with Haftar, and with Sarajevo, and with Misrata, and with the south of the country.
And in this matter, the tribes in southern Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about Southerners stopping the flow of migrants on long-distance approaches?
That is, conditionally speaking, the buses in which Nigerian migrants traveled were turned back?
We are achieving that.
But it is not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in making these streams continue.
We hope to help unite the Southers in the negotiation process between Sarajevo, Haftar and the tribes of the South.
But first we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Sarage.
The head of government in Tripoli Faiz Saraj is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction in the country of the norms of Sharia.
How radical is he?
Will this be an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I will give my personal opinion about him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
Islamists are in the coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country – moderate Islam, open to the world.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get such a reputation?
It is created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, with legislative, executive and judicial powers.
There is the National Petroleum Corporation, the National Bank and other governmental structures.
Certainly, some countries were interested in not getting there.
And we mixed them all the cards and started to actively communicate with Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has entered into a cooperation agreement with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
NOC Director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin concluded a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
Two weeks ago, the first shipment of the Libyan oil company Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with her?
I think to sell.
What are Russia’s economic interests in Libya?
The plan is to re-sign the contracts signed under Muammar Gaddafi.
We are talking, in particular, about previous agreements in the transport sphere (construction of railways), energy (electricity) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have to pay?
They have oil.
That is, is it, as in the case of Iran, a scheme of "oil in exchange for services"?
I do not know what the scheme will be, I do not directly deal with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are actually working on peacekeeping.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree with each other so that they can establish order and Libya ceases to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and pushing out the terrorists.
Do you have evidence of the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that there is no one from Russia and other countries of the former USSR there.
He said he has about 50,000 recordings of telephone conversations of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "Ъ") and Russian language does not sound there.
Which countries are these militants from?
I would not want to go into those details.
Then we formulate the question differently.
How many of the Islamist militants in Libya are Libyans themselves?
Libyans are virtually none among them, they are not more than 5%.
The rest are outdoors.
Can Moscow conduct intra-Libyan negotiations following the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are conducting active talks with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have declared their readiness to come again - to Moscow or to Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
Now hard to say.
There are still several visits to be held, and then, I hope, there will be clarity about the time and place of the negotiations.
In the Chekhov museum, charity collected money for a gift to a sick boy
In the sub-Moscow museum-reserve "Melikhovo" nine-year-old boy Sasha Macola, who has DCP, brain hydrocephaly and complete blindness, will receive a specialized runway as a gift on August 5.
The present will be presented by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region Oksana Kosareva and the Director of the Museum Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the training machine was collected during the charitable marathon "Don't tire of doing good", which took place in Melihov on July 15 on the Day of Remembrance of Chekhov.
On the eve of the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino in the Chekhov district: "I can't see my eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
“I would very much like to get a runway as a gift so that my legs become strong and I would learn to walk a little bit.”
Sasha’s dream has come true!
After the award in the reserve museum will be held "Concert-post script" - famous pianist, honored artist of Russia Alexander Hindin will perform popurry from popular classical works.
During the charitable marathon in Melihov, the choir of the Rise of the Dawid Desert, the bells of the workshop of Ilya Drozdikhina, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy named after Gnesin, artists of the Melihov Theatre "Chechov Studios".
For visitors, auctions were held, a book fair and a charitable sale of souvenir products with the logo of the marathon were organized.
The museum-reserve "Melikhovo" took the initiative to make the Day of Remembrance of Chekhov 15 July a single day of charity in all the museums of Moscow.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk Zhytomyr region near the local football stadium several times shot in the direction of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angry with the noise, "FACTAM" in the communication department of the police of the Zhytomyr region.
The man then walked into a nearby cafe.
In the building he had a conflict, during which a man used a device to shoot rubber bullets, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim has received medical care and is not in danger of death.
Police and ambulance arrived at the scene, but the gunman had fled.
Police established his identity and detained him on the same day.
The man could not explain his actions.
He was seized a device for shooting rubber bullets, which was sent for examination.
Criminal proceedings under Article 296 (Huliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have been initiated.
The detainee threatens imprisonment for 3 to 7 years.
In Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of the street of Tatarskaya in the night of July 28 a shooting attack occurred.
Michelle Carter sentenced for reports that prompted Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for using text messages and phone calls to encourage suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to spend 15 months in jail and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at a hearing on Thursday: “My family is murdered by sorrow.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, wearing red pants and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, pressing her hands and lowering her eyes.
“With her actions she killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
She interrupted his life to improve her own.
She did not accept responsibility,” she said.
“She did not show repentance.”
But Carter’s lawyer said it was “a tragic incident she deeply regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his opinion, her "age, level of maturity or even mental illness had no noticeable influence on her actions."
The prosecutor read the statements of Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy, in which it was stated: “There has not been a day that I have not mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I do it – I try to support his sisters despite all the pain that will remain with us forever.”
Roy's sister Camden Roy said she was persecuted by the thought that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become the aunt of his children.
"To lose the person who has always been with me since I was born is a pain that will remain with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case appears to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that would provide responsibility for advising a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case caught the attention of the whole country when it became known that he was pushed to suicide by Carter's messages.
"You can hang yourself, jump from the roof, slay yourself with a knife, I don't know there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote, “You have to do this, Conrad” and “You just have to turn on the lighting and you will be free and happy.”
Judge Monis said Carter wanted to get attention through Roy's death, and forbade her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The opinions of lawyers on this matter are divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murdering her British neighbor in Italy and acquitted two years later.
The 30-year-old Knox published her special opinion in the Los Angeles Times, which stated: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgeny Bogachev: "I released Langford like a bird of high flight"
One of the best basketball players of the United League VTB 33-year-old Keith Langford has left UNIX.
The departure of the American defender "Izvestia" commented on the president of UNICSA Yevgeny Bogachev.
Kit made this decision due to family circumstances, - said Yevgeny Bogachev.
He has a young child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Kit wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different attitude.
He played in UNIX three seasons and in each match showed a high level, placed on all 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and career.
Keith Langford played in the Kazan club for three years, winning the silver of the Unified League-2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season he won the award to the most effective player of the EuroLeague season.
He scored 21.75 points on average per match.
This is the second achievement since the award was established in 2004.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in the history of the Euroleague to receive this award more than once.
In the near future Langford will sign a contract with Chinese "Shenzhen", informs Eurohoops.
The American is expected to sign a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second star in July of the Euro League, which goes to the Chinese championship.
Earlier in the Chinese CBA transferred ex-center "Panatinaikos" Yanis Burusis.
A sunburnt tourist from Moscow was evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Adygei rescuers today with a helicopter evacuated from the mountainous region of the republic a tourist who received the strongest sunburns.
The man rested in the shelter "Fist", located at an altitude of 1,6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old was suffering from high blood pressure and difficulty breathing.
The preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescue workers contacted the head of the tour group, who said that the man received burns during the journey.
Audi to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW said it would offer software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW said the company believes that “there are smarter roads than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – that are considering banning or limiting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it would modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their move a retreat.
European automakers have been actively promoting the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with CO2 emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost for car manufacturers to install equipment that neutralizes diesel car exhausts is also increasing, andining a competitive car price is becoming difficult.
While German automakers are under close surveillance, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also been accused of slandering influential automakers and ignoring signs of a problem.
The companies are trying not to repeat the mistake of Volkswagen, which hid the use of so-called "attack devices", which during the testing could counteract the amount of emitted harmful gases, so that it complies with the rules, and in normal driving conditions turned off.
In the United States, several Volkswagen executives have been convicted, the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics department of the Audi engine development group was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zakkeo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, is therefore not protected from extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi fell under a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission rules and expanded an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is the source of a disproportionately large share of the revenue of Volkswagen.
In Astrahani, a visitor to a cafe paid with fake money
The police received a message from an employee of the bank's branch about the discovery of a suspicious note in the amount of 5 thousand rubles during the recalculation of funds received from the food point.
A study conducted by the Expert Criminalist Center found that it was a fake.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Astrahan region, a banknote was paid by one of the visitors to the cafe who bought a shurma.
It is worth noting that the box was not equipped with a device for determining the authenticity of banknotes.
Currently, the police are establishing persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs urges residents of the Astrahan region to be careful when carrying out financial transactions; employees of trade facilities are recommended to install instruments to verify the authenticity of the received funds.
Astronomers have discovered a planet where even iron can melt.
For the first time studying the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
The scientists noted that the water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Telescope captured the shining of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes the water in the planet’s atmosphere to shine in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but located tens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, the year on the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "Earth" days, and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens the lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but there are now fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has deteriorated due to dry weather and insect-borne diseases; this has caused constant headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Ches, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, says: “Lavanda in Provence is really under threat because in recent years this plant has felt the effects of climate change: in spring and especially in autumn rainfall has become much less.
This affects the life of lavender.
And there are also small cycades, insects jumping on the leaves, carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, they become very many."
There is a lot on the map.
Lavender not only attracts holidaymakers; lavender oil is very in demand in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shess says, “Instead of very long columns with a large number of large colors, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent at all.
Therefore, we have fewer parts that contain essential oil.”
Solutions currently being considered include improving water distribution and slowing soil evaporation, as well as spraying plants with a protective blend of clay and water and removing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
The two-time world hockey champion, Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 Alexander Semin met the day before with beginners hockey players and handed out autographs to fans.
The meeting took place in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 as part of a thematic week dedicated to hockey with shayba.
Any visitor to the tent could ski on the ground with artificial ice.

50 students participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to engage as much as possible in the sports fields and stressed that the most important thing in the initial stage of training is hard work and a huge desire to engage in hockey.
"It is great that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a site as the tent of the Winter Universiade 2019, where beginners athletes can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams," he said.
We note that promoting student sports and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk people are helped by the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019.
The universiade will operate throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the directorate of the Winter universiade-2019.
In the State Department commented on the words of Medvedev
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, commenting on the briefing on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, stated the need to find "area for interaction" with Russia.
According to her, such areas must be found in order to "improve bilateral interaction".
An example of such successful cooperation was the Syrian ceasefire agreement.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
“And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other,” she said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev’s claims of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said this, then it, of course, has the right to speak, but I can say nothing more on this topic," the State Department spokeswoman said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill on tightening sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of the Russian government Medvedev said that Washington has declared a full-fledged trade war to Moscow, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that U.S. sanctions will last for decades.
In addition, the prime minister believes that the American establishment "purely defeated" Trump.
Missing in Moscow bodybuilder found in a foreign country lost memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very spicy circumstances: he came out of the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days he was unsuccessfully sought by local and familiar residents.
And found Shamil in a strange land in Ramensk.
He was found naked in his bathroom.
The Dagestan athlete could not explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He could not even remember his name, and his passport was missing.
Identification of his identity was helped by the announcement of his disappearance.
The doctors who arrived at the call recorded in Hanmetov partial loss of memory and cranial brain injury, reports the publication Mash.
The athletes are expected to have other surprises.
The offenders who abducted Shamil probably visited his apartment, the keys of which were also stolen.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact received oil and gas revenues in July 2017 exceeded the estimated 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as the ministry explains, occurred mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared with the average monthly value of June used for estimation, as well as due to the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of exports of petroleum products of the forecast levels.
"The deviation of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate corresponding to the federal law on the federal budget for 2017-2019 in August 2017 is forecast in the amount of +40,2 billion rubles.", - said in the message of the Ministry of Finance.
Thus, the total amount of funds sent for the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47,6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of foreign currency purchase will amount to the equivalent of 2,07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Each working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions for the purchase of foreign currency at the organized exchanges of the Moscow Stock Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The purchased foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist underlines that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Officials of the Riodose newspaper usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover recent violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa linked to organized crime, corrupt officials, or the ongoing drug dealer war.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about safety.
They were told to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking children with them to an office that had already been bombed in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on a board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no evidence is needed, suspicions and internal sensations will be enough.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being detained by the government or cartels, a whole list of criminals who make the work of disclosing chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence does not stop, and among the bodies that are multiplying in the country, there are more and more journalists: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and this year at least seven people have been killed in seven states.
Among the latter is their publisher and inspiration, the co-founder of Rio de Janeiro Javier Valdés Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdes wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence feels very sharp, although his presence is everywhere – a large photograph of Valdes showing his middle finger, with the inscription “Justice” hanging on the façade of the Riodose building; two reporters years over 30, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts depicting his smile, face in glasses or his brand panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although in 2010 the office of a special federal prosecutor was organized to investigate journalistic cases, so far, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been investigated.
As with most of the thousands of drug trafficking and organized crime killings committed each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodose journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are murdered by grief, though the surroundings are now much more dangerous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice from security talks at meetings, it is of little use, Ibarra says.
“It’s very stupid to waste time at this seminar,” he says.
“Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left Rio de Janeiro’s office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive only a couple of quarters before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot in it 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name - which means "Twelfth River."
The gunman left his car and broke it nearby.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually spread quickly across the Culiakan.
Almost everyone is silent about Valverde.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.
Let’s not talk about the fact that every day one or more people are killed on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with painted two-storey mausoleums of drug kings, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Forget for a moment that the state of "comfort" is simply when one of the cartels takes control of a seaside state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Rio de Janeiro, is crushed by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes helped the murder.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel that is fighting with the sons of Guzman.
The publication could have angered the sons; people who were allegedly members of the gang bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that wrote about the same story was seized.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste and in 2003 together with five colleagues founded Riodose, selling his $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without touching the topic of drugs," Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper earned the reputation of a bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked the fact that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that in this publication they could read about things that no one dared write about.
Eight years after its founding, Rio de Janeiro received the prestigious Marie-Murse-Cabo Prize for its reporter work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in investigating drug trafficking in Mexico, wherever it went.
He honestly admitted that he was scared.
“I want to live on,” he said at the CPJ award ceremony.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviente TV.
"You have to take on the tasks that lie on you as a journalist - either so, or you're just throwing a fool."
I don’t want to be asked, “What were you doing when there were so many deaths around... why didn’t you tell me what was going on?”
The employees of Rio de Janeiro are missing Valdes, a joke man who cried like a shipwrecker in the harbour, a friend who was generous at hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to catch up with the living.
They rely on their order.
He should always wear his hat.
He had to go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: has his love for the once-established order destroyed him?
His death also caused them to question their calculations of how to do their job better and stay alive.
“They don’t like when you get caught up with their wives, their children, their legal business, and the underground airfields for drug trafficking.
“These things were beyond the line,” Bohorkes said.
The result, even in the best times, was a high level of self-censorship and a desire for self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from things that smell bad.
The problem, says Riodose editor Andres Villarreal, is that “the sense of smell can be deceived... and then what happened to Javier happens.”
The old rules, he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak government institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the employees of Rio de Janeiro gathered for security training, it suddenly turned out to be forbidden to bring cell phones: a few days before it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, is used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
Outside, two police officers hide in the shade of a tree from a 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were commissioned by the state government to guard the Riodose office, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois quarter of Kuliakan.
Some of the journalists were half jokingly asking if these policemen were among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials that the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto controlled by drug gangs.
In the next issue, "Rio" counted on three main topics.
It is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of the former boxing champion Julio Cezar Chavez.
They also exposed government spending concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping of people in one of the most expensive restaurants in Kuliakan, in a neighborhood from the prosecutor’s office.
It was not officially announced who was abducted or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of power for almost the last century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when Guzman's son "El Chapo" escaped the military.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for the Valdez column with the most reliable information about the abduction.
"We would have already known what happened before," says the 46-year-old Villarreal, who is nicknamed "El Flacó" for his squalid body.
“Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken.”
Valdez’s office is now being used as a warehouse for posters and stickers to protest the murders of journalists because employees have become what they never thought they would become: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went on a demonstration next morning at the local prosecutor’s office dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Valdez was killed.
They found the burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Thro the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
That day, the director of Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., trying to obtain international support in demanding justice in the Valdes case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
After that, she asked not to give her any more tasks to cover the government’s activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdes has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "enveloped" by organized crime, its co-complices in the government, and the indifferent society.
In his latest book, “Drug Journalism,” he wrote that reporters are not just killed by drug gangs; they do so on the orders of politicians and security services in conspiracy with organized crime.
The Committee on the Protection of the Press Article 19 estimates that half of the attacks on journalists last year were committed by police and government officials.
“In Mexico, you’re dying because they want to silence you,” says Ramirez.
Of course, murders scare people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masías six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body a note was found, presumably written on behalf of the Zetas cartel: "I am here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her cut off head.
Some publications preferred to shut down, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent Miroslav Britch was murdered in March.
Others continue to hold on, like “El Manjana” from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial article on the first page titled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have left their native states or the country in general.
This is a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work, and they still see danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after escaping from Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work are balancing between risky decisions every day.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits that he is scared to write about drug trafficking.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a journalist,” he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready to be printed, the Riodose publishers were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office and drinking beer when suddenly their phones were ringing at the same time.
A series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left behind, according to confirmed data, 19 bodies.
The war continued to erupt, as promised in a series of messages from cartels discovered in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news on the website of Rio de Janeiro via their mobile phone.
The next day I had to rewrite the first page.
In the vicinity there were siren raids - another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes checked whether the police guarding them were ready for defense.
If they were scared, they did not show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was displayed to view the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodose continued his work.
“How can you think of closing down,” said Bohorkes, “if on the same day that Javier was murdered, a trainee asked me to send her out to do a report?”
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, although it is horrifying.
The researchers said that the first found remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhino, discovered by a Canadian miner, were so well preserved that experts called it "Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that the color of his peeling skin was red-brown – and say that he had, in some way, a “dark past.”
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as “the best preserved Tireophorus in history of finds and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.”
This fossil is a newly discovered example of a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the melting period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition stunned researchers, who called him “truly remarkable.”
This herbivorous thyreophore is the best preserved fossil of this species in the history of discoveries, according to articles in the journal National Geographic.
It was found by Sean Fanck while he was working at the Sancor Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed to be different from the surrounding breed, and decided to look closer.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was carried out to find an animal inside the earth's crust weighing 2,500 feet (1100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
“It’s only worth a little bit of sneezing, and you can almost believe he’s asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is being demonstrated.
“It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs – the Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
By examining his skin, the researchers found that this herbivorous, despite being covered with armor and resembling a walking tank, was apparently exposed to a significant danger from the carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful armor-covered dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective coloring, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow him to fuse with the environment faster and avoid encounters with enemies, experts say, suggesting that he was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110 million-year-old creature, belonging to the family of nodosaurs, was widely exposed in the press in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum laboratory assistant Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours excavating it.
The surprising preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the scales and armor plates on his body.
They discovered protective coloring, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although protective coloring is common, the discovery was a surprise, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is much larger than the size of today's protective colored animals.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred to mask confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern protective-colored animals, such as deer, zebras, or armored bearers, are significantly smaller in size and are more affordable prey, suggesting that the nodosaure had to fight seriously for survival.
“The serious threat from predators to a massive dinosaur covered with powerful armor shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Mill era were,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the dinosaur's scalp also suggests that his skin must have been red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the preserved content of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where it sank and fell back down to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to spread much deeper into the land than they are now.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved peeled skin, and at the same time fully preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked at the time, in the Early Melting Period.
It is not necessary to resort to the imagination to recreate it, it is only necessary to squeeze a little, and you can almost believe that it is asleep.
The melting period is the era when giant teropods, flesh-eating dinosaurs standing on two legs, wandered the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, a tyrannosaurus could have been hunted by one of its terrible ancestors.
These include the acrocantosaurus, a 38-foot-long monster (11.5 meters) weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose latest discoveries are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was taken to the sea after his death and mummified in clay.
The creature was found by Sean Fanck while he was working at the Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum staff, this is the best preserved thyrophorus in the world, along with the skin and armor, and it's a whole, from the mouth to the hip bones.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes coming out of their shoulders.
The researchers believe that this herbivorous thyreophore was hard on what is now Canada, until the spilled river took it to the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved his armor with precision to the smallest detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the bushy armor plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Grechko wrote in an article for the National Geographic magazine, such a degree of security is “rare as winning a lottery”.
The longer I look at him, the more striking he seems.
The fossilized remnants of the skin are still covered by bushy armor plates that sow the animal’s skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it are turned up.
I can count the scales on his waist.”
Mikhail Saakashvili arrived in Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
He did so without documents proving his identity and nationality.
About Saakashvili's arrival reports the Polish edition Telewizja Republika, which posted on its YouTube channel a video with his speech.
Saakashvili spoke at the event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he tried to start his speech in this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched on the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
About the fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived him of his citizenship, the dangerous politician learned while in the United States.
How he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is not yet known.
Earlier, the former governor of Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining Ukrainian citizenship was fake.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The investigation period in the case of Weinsicher and Olkhovik extended until January
The term of the preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the group of companies "Renova" Yevgeny Olhovik and the head of the energy holding "T Plus" Boris Weinziger has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basman Court will consider the question of extending the house arrest for the accused.
The representative of the SC at the meeting announced the decision to extend the preliminary investigation period for the last time.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as conduct investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly gave bribes to Comey's leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least 1 billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinziger, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of JSC "Complex Energy Systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who led the company "Vimpelkom" until September 5, handed over to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi bribery for establishing the most advantageous tariffs on heat and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Weinziger and Olkhovik were detained, stationed in Siktivkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin fled the investigation and was declared in federal search.
How did one activist know the answer to the question “Who’s the streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the depths of her soul.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, a native of St. Louis was sitting on the bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, browsing a Facebook tape on her phone.
She encountered the post of someone from high school.
“The police just killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and he’s still lying in the middle of the street.”
Noting that no one else in her tape had posted this information, confused, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
In her tape there were many user posts with the nick @TheePharoah.
A rapper from Great St. Louis in real-time tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black eighteen-year-old teenager killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown’s lifeless body spread out in the middle of the street, where it will be for four hours.
“It’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put off the phone and later in the evening returned to tweets that people were gathering for the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of a signal tape and screaming people and a man claiming he was Brown’s father, holding a poster with the words: “The Ferguson policeman just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live broadcast as a police officer stands in front of a group of protesters with a roaring dog.
In another video, another police officer, she said, picked up a rifle and shouted, “I’ll kill you all... animals!”
“It’s an unusual situation,” according to his own memories, Ferrel said.
"These are not murders like those we are used to and can be called typical.
At that moment I felt a cold.
I was angry and crying.”
She took her flight ticket and flew home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson over the next almost three years has been the theme of the new documentary “Who’s the Street?”, which will be released on August 11.
It’s a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and endurance from the point of view of people living in a community and filling streets demanding answers.
While Ferrell was travelling to Ferguson with her daughter dressed in a flower dress and a wreath of colour, they recalled the conversation, which had been held countless times before that morning, “about the experience of the Negroes and their position.”
She recalls saying, “Do you remember when I told you how black people fought for what they believed?
“We’re going to Ferguson now because a police officer killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and that was wrong.”
“I couldn’t help but take her,” Ferrell said later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of what happened before.
She should know about it, see it and be raised on it.
It must not only be well-known in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black experience and their position and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she personally will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a bad service if I had guarded her from it.”
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop at South Florisant Road, a site across the road from a police station that had become something like a tent camp, while activists were waiting for reports of the final innocence of officer Derren Wilson.
There, Ferrel and his daughter joined a local businessman who prepared lunch packs.
They gathered packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Gradually in consciousness, Ferrell took shape in a new type of activism.
“My activism completely changed after August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Health Students, representatives of national minorities, and dealt with food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
I had no experience with the organizer.
It just came.”
A few weeks later, on an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Saba Folain, one of her co-directors.
Folain said she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrero, “just wanted to document” the events.
Ferrell came to mind with the question, “Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?”
This skepticism was driven by numerous people, often white people, who came into the community to benefit from its pain and persistence.
As Folaine explained in a recent interview, “We’ve heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson don’t get into the spotlight, and we wanted to do it differently.”
By that time, Folain had already teamed up with her co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death penalty issues.
His participation aroused sympathy for the project in Ferrell and six other locals with whom the “Who’s the Street?” team had been in touch for years since Brown’s assassination.
“In this documentary, no one is speaking for us or with us, we are speaking for ourselves,” Davis said.
“It was most important to me how these people would be represented, because it was how I would be represented.”
And although the aim of the project was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell at all – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the leader-saviour, but about how the community unites,” as Folain said – she proved to be the most open-minded of the film’s participants.
As a result, “Who’s the Street?” shows unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” said Ferrell, laughing at how she first saw the finished product.
“But I understood that when you do this work and humanize black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
Furthermore, the Ferrel story once again discusses and emphasizes the role of a black gay woman in the broader context of the Black Life Matters movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – those who created the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media after the murder of a black teenager, Trayvon Martin, in 2012 – classify themselves as gay.
“Black gay women in leadership positions support this whole movement,” says Ferrell, “and all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all this burden.”
Folaine agreed with this statement, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of gay black women.”
However, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination,” and that Ferrell was not chosen as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
“She was the person who awakened that energy,” she said.
“On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that she came to the forefront, because when”
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, Ferguson has not had a movie camera for a long time, but there are still complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on trial for another two and a half years for blocking the highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place she calls home, simply: “Bardak.”
She still holds on to the vocabulary she learned when she walked out on Ferguson’s streets three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We must win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
Two El Salvador players disqualified for bite of U.S. players
El Salvador footballers Henry Romero and Darwin Serren have been disqualified for non-sporting behavior.
During the quarter-final match of the Gold Cup of the North and Central American and Caribbean Football Confederations (CONCACAF), the Salvadorans bitten American players.
The first was defendant Henry Romero.
The El Salvadoran bite the attacker, Josie Altidor, and then kicked him in the chest.
Then the midfielder Serena when giving the corner in his penalty area bitten U.S. defender Omar Gonzales.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Serena for six.
The match ended with the victory of the Americans with a score of 2:0, reports Goal.com.
An artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the center of the hall in the Friedman Gallery in New York City, people's faces hang from the ceiling on the wire - white, black and brown, all somewhat unfathomably similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from scratches from the cheeks and haircut sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent scratches from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst serves 35 years in prison for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called "The Appearance of Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and famous dissident to whom Barack Obama mitigated the sentence just three days before his presidency ended.
By analyzing the DNA obtained from Manning with a computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of faces that people with such a genome could have, Dewey-Harborg created a profound, though difficult to perceive, manifesto dedicated not only to the plasticity of DNA data – the various ways of their interpretation and the inherent determinism of these interpretations – but also to the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has openly stated herself as a woman since her teenage age, was convicted in 2013 of 20 episodes, including six violations of the Spy Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photographs in prison were inaccessible, so only one of her photographs was known: a grainy black-and-white selfie, on which Manning in a platinum-shade pearl, clearly feeling uncomfortable, is sitting behind the wheel of a car; with this photo she and became associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed her 2012 project "Visions of Strangers".
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using legal evidence such as cigarettes and chewing gum, extracting DNA from this garbage and creating images of how these people might look.
And then she received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning in jail and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article,” Dewey-Hagborg said at a preliminary presentation of the new exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait created from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her imprisoned muse became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book titled "Suppressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which depicted how in the future the president will soften Chelsea's punishment and she will be able to visit the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just days after the book came out was a pleasant surprise after seven tough years in a military prison in Kansas.
There’s something deep and powerful about the exhibition opening right now as Donald Trump declares war on people who disclose secret government information and invent new ways to incite Twitter hostility that he’s supposed to mitigate.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of this all over time, she said that "nothing happens by chance."
In a statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning’s huge signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of a point above “i” in her surname) calls for an end to “the automatic separation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture.”
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long hose of C, G, and A.
By incorporating 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist scientifically refinedly expresses), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how we are all surprisingly similar, at least in their biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open genetic data is to interpret, and how subjective it is," Dewey-Harborg said; her 2007 video work, False Memories, is also displayed here.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here.”
The last part of the exhibition, which fits in the same room, is the aforementioned comic book.
On it, King Kong-style Manning appears over the building of the U.S. Correctional Cases with a speaker in his hand.
“If they kill your speech, they will win,” it says.
“So never be silent.”
“This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me,” says the artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
“I still have skin cramps when I’m talking about it.”
Manning hasn’t seen the exhibition personally yet – as it was provisionally depicted in the comics – but when she arrives, she’ll be welcomed by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacres gathered together like crowds of protesters.
This was also done intentionally, like everything on the exhibition up to the height (5"2, Manning's height), on which genetic haplogroups were drawn with a pencil.
“I used to hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people,” says Dewey-Harborg about the portraits.
“I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, as the movement that stood behind her liberation.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee is being sought by police for murder
According to the police, there is a nationwide search for a professor of the Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who are being sought as suspects in connection with the fact that a dead man was found in a luxurious room in Chicago.
According to the protocols of the Cook County Court, on Monday, warrants were issued for premeditated murder without the right to bail-free release of 42-year-old Windham Latham and 56-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, the twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after he was inflicted multiple kneeling wounds.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they came to the apartment complex "Grand Plaza" and found the victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was declared dead on the scene of the crime, and now detectives are investigating the death from knife wounds, believing it was a murder, while police are intensifying the search for two suspects.
Latam has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, vice president of the University of Communications, said in an email statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was banned from entering the Northwestern University campuses.
“Now this is a criminal case, which is being investigated by authorities, and the Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation,” Kabaj said.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
A University and Somerville College spokesman said in an email: “We have been in contact with the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigative authorities.”
The statement also said that Warren’s colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
The head of communications at the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly advised the suspects to surrender to the organs.
“The police have assumptions about their location, but our attempts to find them are increasing,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police were called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in room 1008.
Police called the scene of the crime terrible.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
According to him, data from video cameras confirm that Latam and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were linked,” Guglielmi said.
The management of the Grand Plaza issued an appeal to the guests, in which it was: “At the moment, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic accident.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA roadmap in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set for the resumption of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), will be fulfilled in the near future.
"A certain stage in the implementation of the requirements has been completed, RUSADA has received the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (the anti-doping agency of the United Kingdom).
The WADA roadmap was updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap on Restoration of Compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA and was recently published on the WADA website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could pose difficulties for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be fulfilled.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian anti-doping structures should publicly recognize the results of an investigation commissioned by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
Referring to this issue, Mutko said: "We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures were taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not acknowledge what was not.”
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
On the morning of the same day in an interview with the Russian edition "Rsport" Smirnov acknowledged previous problems in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 following a doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to WADA’s Moscow office in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Nigli said RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” to restore its work.
Fire in 79-storey tower in Dubai
A major fire that occurred in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, the tower The Torch, has been extinguished, reports Reuters.
It is noted that the firefighters managed to cope with all the fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 Moscow time).
Local authorities said no one was injured as a result of the incident.
At the time of the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed.
The causes of the incident are unknown yet.
Earlier it was that the 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, is burning in Dubai.
All residents were evacuated on time.
The unimaginable outfit of Buzz shocked fans: trousers that do not cover cowards
Scandalous reality show host "House-2" Olga Buzova struck the viewers of the festival Europa Plus Live dances in shorts.

Both girls came out on stage in provocative "houses", sewn in such a way that the appearance of the singer's underwear.

Earlier it was how changes in the appearance of Buzova commented on a specialist of one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg acknowledges deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was on Friday, August 4, the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO’s secretary-general also criticized Russia for the situation in Crimea and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine.”
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia, however, is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said that relations between the United States and Russia are at a dangerously low level, and accused the U.S. Congress of this.
Yekaterinburg Metro is learning a new method of payment
In October, the transit in the Yekaterinburg metro will be possible to pay by bank card, said the general director of JSC "I-Net" Pavel Vedernikov in an interview with the "Oblast newspaper".
Our goal is to introduce the same system of metro payment for the 2018 World Cup as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
“We want fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metro with their bank cards, without buying tokens and not standing in line,” he said.
Startups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among her e-commerce startup employees, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or worse, dishonest.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
“He’s never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, who runs a 75-member, San Francisco-based e-commerce hair care company called Madison Reed.
Therefore, he appealed to third parties for help.
Now there is a new type of HR start-up that helps companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software that measures employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct express surveys, contact specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass top management and contact direct management.
“Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City’s Glint startup, whose analytics software is used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she has gained a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel over three years of using Glint.
In addition to the express surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a heat map of the company and shows in a visual form which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, allowing it to understand why.
Companies are gradually realizing that they need to control the situation at work, otherwise they will become another “Uber” who was involved in the scandal when a former employee posted a blog post describing an aggressive situation in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups like Glint, the desire to control the situation is an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to the Financial Technology Portal, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a start-up in Denver, Colorado that helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year against the backdrop of Uber’s falling reputation.
Convercent has 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber appeared among the customers.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized staff opinion surveys, collect confidential real-time answers, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the management.
“The public opinion court has seized the authority of the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that a company treats employees badly or behaves unethically, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company could face costly consequences in the form of customer boycotts, employee outflows, and lawsuits, Queen said.
Ruby Tuesday, a chain of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees across 500 establishments, has used Convercent for more than a year to make sure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and offer an easy way to contact the company’s headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look for the head office phone or email number, file an official complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, head of the Ruby Tuesday legal department, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay – can be quickly detected and addressed.
“I can approach a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday network’s risk management group.
“And we are protecting our shareholders from legal proceedings with employees.”
According to Queensland, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after Arthur Andersen’s accounting firm collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron Case.
But it was only when “social networks” gained mass spread that companies realized they couldn’t keep their dirty underwear from spreading the virus online.
“Before starting to use technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies regular fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that has been approved by venture capital investors who have supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, resulting in a total capital of $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, resulting in a total capital of $60 million.
These investments are unlikely to be surprising given the interrelated nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing volume of research shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than they did before.
In highly competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and exciting projects are just the necessary minimum.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they dedicate their time to the company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in a company, feel that they’re being heard and that the work they’re doing is productive, they’re more willing to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors get income when the business of companies from their portfolio goes well; business of companies goes well when employees are dedicated and involved.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it’s no surprise that they find support.
According to culture experts at workplaces, it is important to have data on employee engagement.
But the data is useless until the company’s trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can create the impression that changes are coming.
And if changes don’t come quickly enough, or don’t come at all, frustration can develop, and employees will lose interest.
“If you’re going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you should be prepared to hold 4,000 conversations,” says Russell Ruth, president of consulting at management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go to the end, the staff will guess, ‘Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
And if you don’t care, why don’t I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports a problem using Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long run this knowledge will help it to keep employees more efficiently in an industry known for its high flow of personnel.
“If you don’t try to create a culture of transparency, you’ll lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
If you lose customers, you lose the company.
In Barnaul opened a new asphalt on the Red Army Prospect
In Barnaul took cardinal measures to eliminate the cause of the failures of asphalt on the Red Army Avenue.
The place where the hole twice arose on the recently asphalted roadway (crossing with Youth Street) has been decided to "open up".
Recall, the collapse of a small section of the road near the tram routes occurred due to the fact that the land in the area of the homeless unused network.
According to Ivan Harmat, deputy chairman of the city committee on road economy, improvement, transport and communications, a detailed examination will be carried out for detailed examination and elimination of the preconditions for the collapse.
Depending on the results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that it will be necessary to restore the shell of homeless communications and concrete them.
This is on the official website of the capital.
The Bruins have to exercise longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day.
Time is approaching eleven o’clock; a crowd of footballers from the University of California in Los Angeles are delayed to talk on one side of the team’s new training fields located on campus.
Some of them tightened their T-shirts, exposing their backs shining from sweat after the busy first day of a sports camp.
For many of the team’s players, these minutes of restraint make up a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled for the summer classes will go back to the dorms after a three-hour training to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning they will return to the Wasserman football center for meetings at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into a Tuesday, Bryan’s coach Jim Mora said, “The next three days these guys are waiting for a meat mowing.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the burden for players, actually extended their working days – at least until the exams ended on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three training sessions of the team of the University of California in Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 p.m., so that they fit into the already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of not having two workouts a day has been a larger number of days with one workout, and Bruins moves the beginning of the camp by almost a week compared to last year and holds training during the summer school for the first time in six seasons of Mora in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to do 18 training sessions until August 20 inclusive before starting official preparations for the first game of the season against the Texas University A&M team in September.
Mora said he supports the change of the rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that because of it, another item appeared in the tight schedule of players.
“For three or four days we’re giving them this huge load, it’s a serious test,” Mora said.
“And they just overcame him, they work, they’re great guys.
I think when we live until Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great.”
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will close the training; it’s a difficult task as its fields are in direct sight from the adjacent parking lot and from the adjacent Laskin Center, a expensive hotel that has already been bombarded by football balls overtaking the defensive grid behind the gates.
Players from the Bruins are expected to book the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have a guard,” Morra said.
“It’s a serious problem, and I’m not exaggerating the danger by assuming that somebody can remove a room, sit there and record the training on video.
If you have a training video, it’s very serious.
But we will have a guard there and there will be a guard on the parking lot number 8.
We will do our best with what we have.
I will not worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
All victims of terrorist attack in St. Petersburg released from hospitals
All the victims of the terrorist attack in the St. Petersburg subway in April have been discharged from hospitals.
This was in the press service of Deputy Governor Anna Mitianin.
According to data at the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, reports "TV Center".
The explosion in the metro in St. Petersburg occurred on April 3.
The bomb was detonated by the suicide terrorist Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall, on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended the metro of St. Petersburg to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport safety, in particular, increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook Increases Fact Checking in Fight against Fake News
Facebook will more often send suspicious texts to independent experts and display their conclusions under original posts, the world’s largest social network said on Thursday, which is trying to fight so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said it was starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mystifications, send them to check, and possibly display fact-checking results under the source post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread the so-called fake news, which many believe has influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
This issue has also been heavily debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports ahead of the presidential election in May, and in Germany before the September elections said they supported a plan to penalize social media if they did not promptly remove hate-inducing posts.
In a separate German-language statement on Thursday, Facebook that it was testing a new fact checking algorithm that was launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing what messages are challenged by independent verificators, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they are reading and what they are sharing,” wrote Sarah Sue, Facebook news tape manager.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the "related articles" feature and work on other changes to the news tape to address the problem of fake news.
Create a comic book: One Castle in English History
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 70s and 80s served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the Valley of the Bull River in Kent, he watched the tumultuous history around and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with coarse hair and a tendency to historical documents, to a comic book.
“I think it’s so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago,” he says with enthusiasm.
“You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand.”
The Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Everest and tells about the families who lived in Scottsdale; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists – Isaac Lenkiewicz, Brian May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabelle Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archival data: in 2014 he wrote "Dead Man's Teeth and Other Stories" - a collection of British Library documents; this project unexpectedly touched him to the depths of his soul.
“I could be upset by just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites,” he says.
“This is his fingerprint.”
And letters always smell smoke, because in those times, fire was lit to illuminate.
And in 300 years, in the future, it seems to you that you are there too.
Oh, how I love the archives!”
For a person so overwhelmed by such a passion for old papers, getting support from the National Fund and the English Art Council and living in the castle for four months (“Honestly, I’m a bit overwhelmed there”) seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days studying the "new" Victorian castle, walking through the archives and examining numerous treasures of possessions and ancient things - for example, heads of hyens on the walls or bottles that have been lying in the roof for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking with foresters, gardeners and sometimes with artists working on illustrations for his book.
Then at night he “drinked whiskey and sat down to write.”
The history of the Scotty Castle is not much studied, because the National Fund only got full access to it in 2006, when its last heir, Elizabeth Hassy, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had only begun to deal with the archive, which he describes as “what the aristocrats have been dropping down on the roof for centuries.”
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: “You think land disputes are boring,” says Rhodes, “but two families fought for this breeze.
It is so, guys!”
In some stories of the collection, the castle becomes a starting point for broader exploration of English history: for example, in The Worker, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
"There is information about the uprising that occurred in the castle in 1380 in a book called The Knights of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
“The peasant uprising began in these places, and I thought the uprising was the right start.
Per they were connected?”
Other plots are closely connected with the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smugglers, about the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have orchestrated his own funerals by filling the tomb with stones (this was discovered a few years later when the tomb was excavated).
The Darrels were Rhodes’ favourite family of all who inhabited Scotty: “The gentlemen seemed to have been a complete fool, forever in debt and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
Over generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy older women – I imagine them as a company of nice guys who can take care of the heirs of great fortunes.”
After graduating from the castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in a Finnish cave, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elyamiaki - a place where at the beginning of the 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it was grown into a forest again.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave,” he says.
"I felt like this: Fuck, I have to go back to real life again."
The 15 largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alpha-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC "Opening", seven more credit organizations are about to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of ARB organizations will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out - all the banks that have declared a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Association of regional banks "Russia", which is headed by the well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on the financial market, recognized by the end of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma committee and deputy in the number of draft laws prepared.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was laid during a discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, suggesting a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, president of ARB, said that, in the opinion of the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which thus try to limit the capabilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims was criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justify the withdrawal of licenses from some banks, which, indeed, followed objections from the representative of the Central Bank: many heads of the fined banks, in particular, Vnesprombank, were in the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in the very sensitive to relations with the main regulator banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, declaring disagreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare for joining the association "Russia", noting that "the effectiveness of the ARB is at a low level, and a constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually conducted".
Investors are better.
How will the case end?
We will answer immediately the main question that arises when the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sector or next to it: depositors are not threatened, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Anatoly Aksakov, known for his sensitivity in everything concerning the interests of banks and their clients, is a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: virtually all the management of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through expert assessments of "regionals".
On the personnel and organizational level, obviously, no special shocks are expected.
Undoubtedly, ARB is falling into a difficult financial and managerial situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, in this oldest - established in 1991 - organization, defending the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation as a whole.
It cannot be said that in the association "Russia" with open arms are ready to accept on any terms new members, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe, too much will want"), who on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, stated that "literally the next day, the representatives of the banks that left the ARB asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our association "Russia".
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of the international banking forum.
We will decide there.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "the chair does not hold", called a possible new head of the updated association "Russia" Georgy Luntovsky, who leaves in September the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, highly characterized his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently resting in Crimea, plans to break the holiday for one day and arrive in Moscow, for an extraordinary meeting of the Association Council "Russia", where it is planned to consider the issue of the agenda of the extraordinary congress of "Russia".
The entry of cars with a gasoline engine in the major cities of Russia will not be restricted
Deputy head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Asul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with a gasoline engine in the major cities of Russia will not be restricted.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
We need to gradually raise the environmental class.
And then the concept immediately move to zero emissions.
I think we are not technically ready for this.
The question is: from which year?
This is the same on the level of slogans phrase - let's prohibit.
Where and when?
and tomorrow?
Shut down the whole city?
"In 20 years - I don't know, maybe it will happen," the Prime Minister said.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study proposals on possible options of state support for electric transport, submitted to the government by the general director of PJSC KamAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of cars with DVI in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a green card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump said that a new U.S. immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will change.
The plan includes reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
“The new application process will provide advantages to candidates who speak English, have the financial resources that allow them to sustain themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should worry us
We didn't have time to think that 2017 could not be worse, a new report on technological successes in the production of sex robots was released.
The MDA.
Sex robots are at the center of attention.
The Fund for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report devoted to the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharky, an honorary professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we should take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
"People are shaking about this, but companies are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we will see much more of them," Sharky said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts into robots with silicone leather, warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also “customize” their robots to their own taste, choosing everything from the color of their eyes and the shape of the robot’s nipples to the shape and color of their nails.
But the fact that many robots have a “personality” compared to which the Stepford Woman would seem very progressive is worrisome.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone leather.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to customize robots with qualities they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by "True Companion" that come with a already programmed individuality - for example, "Cold Farra" makes the impression of shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "courageous" character.
“Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits perfectly with yours,” True Companion said.
So she loves what you love, doesn’t like what you don’t like, and so on.
She changes mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may “be in a mood!”
The emergence of sex robots is a lot of concern – not least because they replace real human relationships – but the most disturbing is the subordinate image of women, the association with rape, which is caused by the mastery of the Cold (read: resistant) Farah.
On the site "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
“If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can’t men have a Roxxxy?”
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a shift from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men won’t buy sex robots, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what is communicated to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are neither bad nor aggressive until the free market allows them to do so.
It’s no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots emerged just when women’s rights around the world were threatened, when the White House is home to a president who boasts of being attached to women.
The most terrifying thing about the TV series "The Servant's Tale" is not the graphic images, the twisted bodies and the pressed eyes, but just how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn’t seem so big now.
The purpose of the sex robot industry is to such physical resemblance to real women (only with proportions of porn stars) as technology allows.
Their creators want them to look like people to the touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is precisely by their "characters" that robots don't look like real women.
They cannot break up with their partners or leave them.
They have neither life nor biography—nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, servants.
Los Angeles native Eugene (Puch) Jeter, who has been playing for the national team of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will start on August 31.
This was by the general manager of the "blue-yellow" Andrei Lebedev in an interview with BeBasket.
We tried to get along with Jeter, but unfortunately he won’t come because of family circumstances.
We’ll go to the EuroBasket without a naturalized player because we don’t want to take someone we don’t know.
"This situation will give opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
With the direct participation of Jeter, the national team of Ukraine took the record sixth place in the Eurobasket 2013 and for the first time entered the world basketball championship, at which the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the U.S. native scored an average of 15.4 points for the game, made 3 selections and gave 5 transfers.
Jeter has ceased to play for the national team of Ukraine since leaving the post of the head coach of our national team American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
EuroBasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their group tournament matches in the Promised Land.
Evgeny Murzin will have five matches in Group B: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3th), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparation for the tournament, our men’s national team held two control matches, in which it succumbed to the Dutch and Belarusians.
The great success of Trump?
Imagining Mita Romney seems very sensible.
In the Trump era, it was common that political disputes that polarized the American electorate, at the micro level, broke up some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers were filled with columns about how to deal with terrible relatives voting for Trump.
It seems we are all so tense that we will soon break.
Fewer talk about Trump’s ability to bring families together.
I write about it because my cousin, a left-handed poet from Chicago who has long been on knives with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting in the fight against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including her Republican brother, with whom she has argued about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely found themselves on the same side.
Dinner is undoubtedly good; but I can’t help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed strength into his left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule could shift us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop being struck by his outbursts.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the background of his standards, will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself on what I really miss today on Mitta Romney’s old-fashioned madness – with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looked like) – compared to Trump and both seem to be a very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will just have to be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park – the biggest carousel in the New York Department of Parks farm and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are terrible and enormous, the glass fiber images on the central drum - grimace clowns and animals who, bending, in horror look at their backs - are extremely sinister, and the ringing music, as strange as it is, delights.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: the views from the skyscrapers are outdated, the silhouettes of the buildings are too narrow to cause tremors, and the reality of the city does not have time to follow the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I’m still experiencing the day I learned that the Swiss Cottage district wasn’t actually a Swiss Cottage (the “Ye Olde Swiss Cottage” theme pub isn’t in charge), but a large circular intersection in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old, an eleven-year-old and two women over forty can have a great time.
If I could put a carousel rating, I would put a fifth but, fortunately, nobody asked me about it.
And at the supermarket this week, I was asked to rate my “experience” of shopping on a scale from one to five stars before taking a card through the terminal.
In the cafe at the corner of my street, all the same plus the option of accompanying a 15 percent tea rating is for order at the stand.
As a result, not only is the idea-neutral interaction slowed down, but it is also necessary to introduce a personal attitude to a situation that does not involve it.
The poor saleswoman in the supermarket smiled confusedly as I tired of evaluating my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
Pistorius leaves prison for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to the hospital for treatment of wrist cuts, which the prison administration claimed he received as a result of falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of deliberate murder after the prosecutor’s office appealed to the original sentence for unintentional murder.
He killed Steenkamp early on Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting her several times through the door of a toilet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he thought his girlfriend was a night thief hiding in his toilet.
The prosecutor’s office said it intended to file another protest, this time against Pretorius’s six-year sentence, which she said was too mild.
The prosecutor’s office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be considered this year.
Pretorius’ term could be extended by 15 years if the prosecutor’s office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The suspect in the beating of the NTV journalist selected a subscription for non-exit
Metropolitan law enforcement officers have chosen a precautionary measure in the form of a subscription for a man who attacked NTV journalist Nikita Razvozhaev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
“In the framework of the investigation of the criminal case initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (the “Battle”) against a 32-year-old man who struck the face of a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation named after Gorky, the suspect was selected a precautionary measure in the form of a subscription on non-exit and proper behavior,” Volk said.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol for disobedience to the police was drawn up in respect of the suspect.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast to the Day of Air Defense, a drunk man approached the correspondent and struck him in the face.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with the VDV.
According to Razvozhaev himself, the desanters, on the contrary, tried to detain the Moskovich.
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people, including two Bulgarians, were detained in Sitonia.
They were released the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told BBC that Bulgarian citizens were then released.
Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on anyone who is caught while parking in an unspecified place.
Inspections will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Russian Foreign Ministry Accuses US Vice President of Cold War Rhetoric
Statements made during the European tour of U.S. Vice President Michael Pence have been criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is stepping deeper and deeper towards the primitive ideological stamps of the Cold War, which are completely detached from reality,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
So the Foreign Ministry reacted to Pence’s words about the “Russian threat” and attempts to forcibly cut the borders, which he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed out the destructiveness of the choice “with the West or with Russia” and the obscurity of the thesis about the allegedly non-alternative accession of all Southeast Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to repel Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another focus of tension.
“We call on our American colleagues to stop shaming Russia and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and readiness to work constructively together, on mutual consideration of interests,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Felder was injured in an accident with an ambulance in Moscow
The accident occurred in Stupino near Moscow, as a result of a collision of a foreign car with an ambulance car, a field sheriff was injured.
Today around 8:10 a.m., a Mitsubishi car collided with an ambulance in the city of Stupino in the Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the car of the ambulance turned over," TASS said in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Moscow region.
Police officers are working on the scene of the accident, the circumstances of the incident are being clarified.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw out her newborn son at the construction site, wrapped in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of August 3, a local resident received a message from the Division of Police that he found a package with a baby in a non-built private house.
“Law enforcement officers and doctors went to the scene of the incident, who promptly brought the child to a medical institution,” the head of the Odessa National Police said.
The doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his detection, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical cord.
During the priority operational and investigative measures established the identity of the woman - a 36-year-old local resident.
It is also established that the woman has three other minor children.
As noted in the headquarters, in the field of view of law enforcers the family did not previously fall and was not on special account.
Currently, the police are establishing the circumstances and reasons that have compelled the woman to this act, after which a procedural decision will be made.
The child is now under the supervision of doctors.
As earlier, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature child into the rubbish pipeline.
Gregory Leps: "I am going to fight, although 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage Grigory Leps will celebrate his 55th birthday on Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke with the observer "Izvestii".
I remember what your “supervisor” was saying.
A special tent in the "Luzhniki", Gloria Geynor sang for the name, a powerful salute over the Moscow river.
You probably pretended then that you would like to spend your next five years.
Plans have come true?
In terms of career, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, I went on tour all over the country three times, I gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He has released two good albums.
Of course, I’m not the one I was, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock is not fooled.
Singing the way I sang when I was 30, becomes more and more difficult.
But I’m fighting, I don’t want to stop.
And with new people, I think I’m going to a different level.
With them you are recording a new album, the first in three years.
Work on him is now going on.
We’ve already recorded it all in my studio and will now send it to Los Angeles.
It is called "Why are you so serious?" by the song of the same name, which was written together with Timati.
It is not fully ready yet, so we have not put it anywhere yet.
We will do this later when we record the clip on it.
And the album will be presented in November - for a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow's "Crocus City Hall".
To your new record attached a hand of cool American drummer Chris Coleman.
Do you think you wanted to bring him into your tour?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to me in the studio, recording his parties.
I offered him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer participating in various projects.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, gently speaking, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from € 35 thousand to € 45 thousand a month.
Then I thought that I would find decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And found a great drummer Max Malysheva.
It is better to feed them.
Sometimes I want to beat one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
Western music magazines write about him, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wei, listening to his play, said that "a new generation of guitarists came, with a different performance technique."
Your album is being released in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you can’t come to the U.S. yet?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
To be honest, I do nothing now.
There are several lawyers who are dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I really regret not being able to go to America.
I have said many times that I am studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We are not stupid than them, but we do not have such experience, school.
In front of our performers of popular music for 70 years, the tasks that have always been solved by American musicians have not been set.
They strive for the highest quality of sound.
I try to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the UK has denied me entry for ten years.
But I will still apply for a visa at the British Embassy every year so that I will be allowed to go there again and, most importantly, work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favorably.
And already in August you are planning a concert in Monaco, not a custom, but an affix, right?
Yes, there’s a good sports hall in Monte Carlo, I’ve played there once.
Now I have been invited again and, as far as I know, all tickets for the concert have already been sold out.
Will you go to the "Lyma Waikule" meeting, which will begin on July 20 in Jurmal?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a magnificent woman who can present herself with a beautiful vocal and even a whisper.
After tours and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you once again want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
Two albums with his songs are already on your discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done completely differently.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky in about the same submission as he did.
Only voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to attract to participate in the album and Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum.
I’ve talked about this with him, we have a good relationship, but he’s a busy man, so we’ll see what happens.
You and the songs of Boris Grebenchikov gradually entered his repertoire.
Maybe you’ll write his album?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I crossed up with him several times and asked: Can I sing one or another of his songs?
He replied, “Gregory, I write songs so that they can be performed.”
Please try and sing.
It would be interesting to record such an album.
For now I have no such task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may make such a project.
Unless you concentrate entirely on the business of your production center.
I think, until you have realized his potential, you have not signed contracts with all the artists that you are interested in?
There are a number of performers I would have dreamed of having under my wing, but they are independent, established people.
Do you mean Sergey Lazarev?
Sergey is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with something about his repertoire, but he is a professional and has his own development strategy.
And in my center now is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in "Voice".
We have a contract with him and we are working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be a pity if he did not reach the heights he deserved.
I try to pick up his repertoire, I make clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists in my center: I buy them songs, I pay the poets, sometimes their tracks get in the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
At the exit they will receive a recorded album, several clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
I would be pleased if one of them achieved commercial success and paid me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if this does not happen, I will not block the oxygen to anyone.
Let everyone work, break through, prove, as I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered a tour of Ukraine and guaranteed entry into the country, will you go?
I am still invited there.
These are mainly closed activities.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, who, in my own conviction, flew to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that you need to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I will fly.
I don’t care what bloggers and critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that such a situation has happened to us with Ukraine.
Because I believe we are one people and we must be together.
It is unlikely that this will happen, at least not soon.
And before I gave for the year in Ukraine for 40-50 concerts.
We met like nowhere.
A very grateful audience.
And with several Ukrainian artists cooperated: Anni Lorak, Sveti Loboda, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine there are a lot of gifted people, and it is a sincere pity that now they cannot fully spread their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would be pleased to invite some good Ukrainian artist to Russia, such as Slava Vakarchuk, and make a concert with him.
But at the moment it is unlikely...
Andrei Ohlopkov moved from the cosmodrome
As it became known "Ъ", the technical director of the cosmodrome East Andrei Ohlopkov began work in the State Space Scientific and Production Center (GKNPC) named Khrunichev.
Earlier, he de facto engaged in the construction of the cosmodrome Vostochny, but due to disagreements with the management of the Center for the operation of ground and space infrastructure (CENKI) was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow's Files, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Ohlopkov will not have a substitute: the position of the technical director will most likely be abolished, and the functionality will be scattered by the units of CENKI.
About the fact that Technical Director of the East and Deputy Director General of the Central Energy Agency for Technological Development Andrei Ohlopkov went to work in the Khrunichev GKNPC, "Ъ" told top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
"He has been working on the new post for several weeks," the industry's interlocutors said.
It was not possible to obtain an operational comment from CENKI on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was unavailable for comments.
However, the information "Ъ" was officially confirmed in GKNPC.
He decided to move to the position of director for coordination of production, - said at the enterprise. - Andrei Ohlopkov has fully fulfilled the task set before him to ensure the launch minimum for the first launch at the cosmodrome Vostochny.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to work at CENKI in 2013, having behind his shoulders service in the space troops, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome he held the post of first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Ohlopkov became a figure in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, from his submission, regional merchants received state orders for scooters, but did not fulfill their commitments on cleaning the separable parts of carriers in the Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The duties on technological development assigned to him in the CENKI extended to various projects, but the main of them was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, then head of the Federal Space Agency, in an interview with "Ъ" directly said that the situation on the East "was critical already in October 2013".
The fact is that a strategic mistake was made in planning: the completion of construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 carrier missile were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
In order to launch before the end of the year, the construction was decided to be completed six months earlier and the deadline was moved from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, we had to go to the trick: CENKI specialists began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment on unbuilt facilities.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrey Ohlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and yet the transfer that happened (instead of December 2015 "Soyuz" flew only April 28, 2016), this idea was justified, says the source "Ъ" at the cosmodrome: "Otherwise we would not have yet carried out a single launch from the Eastern, but would be engaged in construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversaw the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Ohlopkov his "space Susanin", but it was from him that he almost always asked for information about the progress of construction.
Mr. Ohlopkov also remembered the straightforwardness: for example, in an interview with "Ъ" he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Specstroy) of the status of the only executor on the Eastern and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we put all the eggs in one basket of the Special Construction?"
This idea has been supported by the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has assumed the duties of a general contractor to complete construction and installation work on the start and technical complex to the planned launch in the fourth quarter.
According to "Ъ", the reason for the transfer of Mr. Ohlopkov to the new place of work were disagreements with the leadership of CENKI regarding the methods of completion of construction of structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as methods of working with subcontractor organizations.
"It was decided that it would be better for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the Eastern.
An employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, finding him an equivalent replacement will not be easy."
According to "Ъ", this will not be needed: the position of the technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be scattered by the units of the CENKI.
In music schools will be a program of training in two specialties
In the future, students of children’s music schools will be able to receive two specialties simultaneously.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Svyatoslav Golubenko, for this it is possible to re-read repeating disciplines to students, and the issue of paying for the remaining classes in the second specialty can be solved with the help of special grants.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we together with the expert community will develop a mechanism that will allow us to master two specialties, but at the same time it will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday in the course of Vladimir Putin's "Nedet Talk" with students of the children's center "Sirius" student Maria Andreeva that she was forced to pay for repetitive subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she is studying violin and piano class and has awarded competitions in both directions.
The head of state recognized its issue as very urgent and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian detained climbing the wall on a skyscraper
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian Kirill N. was detained, who climbed the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, reports the portal El Universal.
The incident occurred in the capital of Mexico.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, crossed through a three-meter fence into the territory of the Nestle office building complex and independently climbed on one of its towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance or ropes.
The young man was arrested on the roof.
Employees of the Ministry of Public Security dropped him to the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
The police are investigating whether the young man is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, the video of a young man climbing a hill has become popular on the Internet.
Users called the young man “spiderman.”
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help ease IBS.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help relieve symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to ease symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid protein tryptophan promotes the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Leading researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the intestines ensure that harmful microbes coming from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is disturbed too much in the direction of inflammation, this can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a specific bacterium in the intestine have cells that increase their tolerance.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan – one of the building blocks of the protein – to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between one species of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is part of a normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan was in the diet of mice, the more these immune cells they had.”
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation environment in the gut.
Postdoc Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying a variety of immunosuppressive cells, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, while another group, which belonged to the same line but was contained separately, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the intestinal microbiomes of mice—communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the intestinal cells of mice were sequenced, and six types of bacteria were found present in mice that had immune cells, but absent in mice that did not.
Mice raised in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells received L. reuteri, and immune cells appeared in them.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid medium and then transferred small portions of fluid – without bacteria – to underdeveloped immune cells separated from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the processing of tryptophan, known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of tryptophan was reduced by half, the number of cells also decreased by twice.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri contribute to the development of cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but in people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, defects in triptophan-related genes have been found.
She says, “Per we need to boost the development of these cells, because the inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may potentially lead to the expansion of their populations.”
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United hired “genius” in the person of Nemanja Matic
“Manchester United” hired a “genius” in the person of Nemanja Matic, says Jose Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The player, purchased for £40 million from Chelsea, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in United’s last pre-season match ahead of the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression as a midfielder, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke forward when they were pleased.
However, since Matic did not take part in Chelsea’s pre-season Asia tour, he was seriously lacking in preparation for the game, and he lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires refinement before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his intellect, his genius in the way he thinks, he thinks in football,” Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him prepare sooner than too late.”
Just like Matic, his comrades-new players Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began forming his main team by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent newspaper this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club has already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire first.
“I am grateful to the club for getting three out of four,” he added.
“I’d be even more pleased if they got me four out of four, but they’ve done a lot for me.”
Former leaders of Lithuanian Social Democrats urge them to remain in the ruling coalition
Former Chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former Prime Ministers Algirdas Butkevičius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Speaker of the Seimas from the Social Democrats Cheslovas Jurshenas appealed to the one-party with an appeal to remain in the ruling coalition.
As by the "Parliamentary newspaper", due to friction with partners - the Union of peasants and "greens" - the Social Democratic Party initiated a discussion whether to stay in the ruling coalition.
Three senior experienced comrades addressed the same party with an open letter, in which, in particular, it is said: "It is clear that the comrades in the party are disappointed with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the "peasants" has created for us, though not very easy, but still conditions for the further implementation of the goals of social justice, which are provided on our initiative in the program of the government, and for the preservation of the political domination of the left center over the right parties."
According to the former leaders of the party, in the discussion so far "the emotional expression of opinion without concrete arguments prevailed."
The authors of the letter fear that unconscious actions of their party could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Invalid Anton Mamayev was fined
The Moscow city court mitigated the punishment of the wheelchair driver Anton Mamayev from four and a half years in prison to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier, by the decision of the Timiryazevsky court, the convicted was released from the SIZO.
At the same time, the Moscow city court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, because he organized the robbery and the abduction of a motorcycle from a former fighter of the special forces.
The Moscow city court mitigated the punishment of Anton Mamayev to 200 thousand rubles. fine.
“Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the composition of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility,” said the press secretary of the Moscow city court, Ulyan Solopov.
In this case, the court has taken into account the state of health of Mamasev, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to impose a sentence below the lower limit.
As for the assistant of Mamayev Vasily Serostanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would be the basis for changing the category of gravity of the perpetrated crime and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamayev himself said that he remained dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow city court.
I am disappointed with the court’s decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse, I intend to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrei Orlov did not exclude appeal of the verdict in the cassation instance of the Moscow city court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all leverages up to the European Court of Human Rights," he told RIA Novosti.
The 28-year-old Moskvich Anton Mamayev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophy, became a figure in the criminal case in the fall of last year.
The disabled claimed to have bought a motorcycle from friends for 160 thousand rubles, then sold it.
However, the owners of the motorcycle, including a former fighter of the special forces, said that the disabled and his assistant Vasily Serostanov took away their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky district court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Serostanov to three years in a colony, and Anton Mamayev - to four and a half years in prison with serving a sentence in a colony of general regime (according to Part 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobilized disabled was placed in SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Human Rights Commissioner under President Tatyana Moskalkova joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamayev was released from the SIC by the decision of the same Timiryazevsky court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in the Moscow city court.
UNFCCC prepares environmental report to the President
The final “Action Forum” of the All-Russian People’s Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told Izvestia and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, according to the results of the forum, the "frontists" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of domestic ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
Interlocutors of Izvestia in the ONF noted that the report to the head of state will contain "deep analysis" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to "Izvestii", the final forum of the ONF will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is adjusted to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally is present at key events of the ONF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulan Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that were made and will be made at these events, we will form systemic proposals for the solution of environmental problems, - told Izvestia an interlocutor in the ONF.
Olga Timofeeva, co-chair of the Central Headquarters of the State Duma’s Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the frontmen will report to the head of state on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the “Action Forum” of the ONF will most likely be combined.
Over the year, we have grown up with a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, seen gaps in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report that we prepare to the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "front workers" report on the work on priority projects of the ONF, - told "Izvestia" Olga Timofeeva.
According to her, the special representative of the head of state on environmental protection, ecology and transport Sergei Ivanov will be invited to the forum.
Earlier, he had already participated in the work of the ONF Media Forum, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go into history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they work for many years.
So that these issues do not fall out of the agenda, - added Olga Timofeeva.
Head of the laboratory of regional policy of the Expert Institute of Social Studies (EISI) Andrei Kolyadin noted: raising environmental issues, the ONF acts in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts offered on various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the president, - said "Izvestia" Andrei Kolyadin.
He stressed that at present, the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be excluded, which can give regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the ONF, the regions will be able to lobby not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism.
The relevance of environmental themes was demonstrated by a “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the garbage landfill in Balashige (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of the city of Nakhodka (already developed a bill on the prohibition of the open transfer of coal in settlements, one of the authors - Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the issue lies in further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions made by the state, - says the head of the charity "Ecology for all" Leonid Bochin.
The head of the non-governmental organization "Greenpeace of Russia" Sergey Cyplenkov in a conversation with "Izvestia" stressed that a responsible approach of society and business is necessary to successfully solve environmental problems, and there are few legislative efforts.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in a strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergey Cyplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violation of environmental legislation is an economically beneficial solution for business.
British inventor implements a microchip to get into the house and car by shaking his hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be installed a microchip so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office and even start a car with a simple handshake.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam has embedded a tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now through his firm BioTech offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist consultant at Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the injection procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that is injected to cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible locks at a price of £300 per lock.
A married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his car "BMW Z4", which starts when his hand lies on the steering wheel.
Requirements for the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to military records provided to Time magazine, the White House’s decision last month to drive a naval helicopter to the Southern Grove for an event dedicated to U.S. industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the "Marine One", when the president is on board, became a central element of the July 17 White House event, which demonstrated American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials examined technology products from all fifty states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire car, and a Mississippi carloader.
According to records from the First Squadron of Marine Helicopters (HMX-1), the department responsible for controlling the helicopter, the White House Military Administration ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or FRAGO, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Pond for an “unusual” event.
"I just wanted you to make sure you are aware because this is an unusual event widely covered in the press," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote in an email to his chief, the first deputy chief of aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the Southern Grove at about 7 a.m. on July 17 to participate in an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would stay there until the lawn was released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the working hours limits.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and security personnel remained next to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records obtained by Time magazine, it remains unclear whether a second crew was needed.
The Hatch Law prohibits federal officials from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event does not contradict this ruling.
“Among other things, we asked if this was a violation of Hatch’s law, and we were answered that not,” the commander wrote.
“You seem to have nowhere to go,” the deputy chief replied.
The “Made in America” event was declared by the White House as an official event, and the Hatch’s law did not apply to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the president made efforts to advance the health care reform that was being developed at the time in the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as “Marine One” and “Air Force One” for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are ordered to use them for travel.
But asking for them solely for the sake of photography is unusual.
Trump was already the subject of discussion in February, when a presidential plane flew in the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was overwhelmed by messages complaining that his predecessor had used the presidential plane.
"The White House is delighted with the 'Made in America' show, which showcased products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials," White House spokeswoman Lindsey Walters said.
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington agglomeration and on the South Pond to train transporting the President of the United States to the White House with an inch-to-inch accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 had 58 training landings near the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight performed for the "Made in America" event was counted to the crew as necessary training flights for the month.
Helicopters also flew 11 additional hours on the day as part of “non-presidential support tasks.”
According to the White House, taxpayers did not pay for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company did not participate in the organization of the demonstration of the helicopter on the Southern Grove.
HMX-1 does not account for the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Defense Ministry’s hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Defense Ministry’s reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit’s records recorded that the aircraft’s time in the air was 30 minutes in each direction from its airfield based at the Naval Infantry Aviation Base of Quantico in Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“Calculating the cost for taxpayers based on an approximate rate of reimbursement is completely wrong,” says Walter.
“These approximate rates include staff, service and many other irreversible costs that are included in annual allocations.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by REND Corporation, the compensation rates do not include the cost of staff, but actually take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and expenses specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House spokesman Sean Spicer spoke in defense of the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to demonstrate this week the things made in America,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to national security, and that there are, I guess, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
Therefore, it is appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while inspecting the South Pebble during the event, but he was sure to sit in the driver’s seat in a fire car.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of company products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said, “I have three.”
Moscow to allocate grants for resuscitation departments of city hospitals
Each year, grants "Saving Lives" will be allocated to resuscitations and intensive care departments of the capital medical clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin visited the City Clinical Hospital named after Yudin.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed a letter of thanks to the physician-traumatologist-orthopedist Viktor Prozko, under whose supervision the most complex surgery was carried out to reconstruct the foot of the teenager.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate grants annually to resuscitations and intensive care departments of urban clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the clinical hospital named Yudin is one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment, allowing its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of Kolomenskaya rural hospital.
At present, the departments of the medical institution are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to the resuscitation and the hospital there are day rooms.
The staff of the hospital is 2800 people.
The total area occupied by the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February this year, the medical institution became a participant in the pilot project on the organization of short-term hospitals (SKP).
They are designed for conducting relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which allows to significantly reduce the time of rehabilitation of patients.
After the operation, they only spend a few hours in the hospital.
Only in the first half of this year in the clinical hospital named Judin was provided hospital care to 36 thousand patients.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU announced the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank

Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian "daughter" to the Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceriyev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guceriyev.
Sanctions against the "daughters" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among them Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, participate, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the UN assistance mission to Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial councils, three women are fighting for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.

SF released Ozerov from the position of the head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the Chairman of the Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Ozerov and dismissed him from this position.
He remains a senator from the Khabarovsk region.
A statement with a request to release him from the occupied position Ozerov wrote last week.
He explained his decision by the need for rotation and his desire to “change the rhythm of life.”
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not momentary.

The Senator has been in charge of the Defense and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for residents and goods producers
More than a decade of efforts by the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
From 1 September, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial recipients will be reduced by 25%.
Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation "On Amendments to the Rules of the wholesale market of electrical energy and capacity and to the consolidated forecast balance of production and supply of electrical energy (capacity) within the Single Energy System of the Russian Federation for subjects of the Russian Federation" (from 17.07.2017 No. 842) established indicative prices on electricity and capacity for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat producers is reduced by a quarter, which will significantly make life easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have plagued the thresholds of the Moscow cabinets in futile attempts to equate the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with the cascade of hydroelectric power plants in Angara, flowing from Baikal, the main water collection territory for which is Buryatia.
Only this year began the movement.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles per kWh to 3.93 rubles per kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by decision of the federal government in the List of territories of price zones of the wholesale market, for which the features of the functioning of wholesale and retail markets are established, the turn of industrial consumers has come.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of the Irkutsk region pays 1,01 rubles per kilowatt per hour.
But nobody dares to name at least an approximate date for new tariff moves toward a downturn for Buryatia.
Scooter did not scare the Prosecutor General of Ukraine and flew to Crimea

National unions of unskilled, municipal and boiler workers (GMB) are concerned about capital investment at McVitie’s factory in Glasgow
The trade union demands guarantees from the managers of McVitie’s biscuit manufacturer in connection with its long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has silently bypassed the question of future investments at the Tolcross facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs cookies and Rich Tea, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie’s, says it has invested more than £5 million in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that in case of any changes in the work of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union “will learn about them first.”
In a letter to the head of the facility owned by the company, GMB’s Scottish branch demanded McVitie’s response to concerns that funding will not be released for upgrading production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “Our union members are deeply concerned that we can’t get clarification from the facility’s chief executive on the business needs and investment plan for Tolcross’s future.”
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in the local society and in Greater Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising livelihoods and chronic decline in production, East End Glasgow desperately needs a flourishing production at McVitie’s factory.
According to a spokeswoman for Pladis, “The head of the Tolcross facility just received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB yesterday, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our ongoing cooperation with employees and trade union representatives.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tolkross, where we openly discussed a number of issues.
We talked to our employees that like all companies operating in the most competitive and volatile economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and this applies to all our facilities and areas of activity – to remain competitive.
“Over the past few years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tolcross facility, especially in production lines and functional performance improvements.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolkross as a production facility, and in case of any changes in the work at this facility, employees and trade union representatives will know about it first.”
Putin says Russia will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers should connect to the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNHK), but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, as well as Rosneft.
Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the request of Igor Sechin to help resolve the contradictions.
The head of state noted that the relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of "Rosneft" Igor Sechin at a meeting on the implementation of large investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District told that the absence of an agreement with "Gazprom" on gas for VNCK puts the implementation of the project at risk.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
"Gazprom offers to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosneft, but we do not have such resources," Sechin added.
Rosneft has asked to allow it to use for the Eastern petrochemical company gas from the Kirinese field of Gazprom, located on the Sahalin shelf.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on this issue are ongoing, and "there are no sharp corners there."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
La Liga member may regret his interest in Marco Verrati
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered £189 million for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about a world record-breaking raid three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when the League 1 club was ready to break the world record for the cost of the transfer, more than twice the previous mark associated with Paul Pogba’s return to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, as the PSG offers him a salary of more than £500,000 a week net.
It is known that Barcelona is furious at how the offer was made and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the management of the Catalan club insists, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transfer from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world not warned of such a possibility three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Mathieu in 2014, Nasser al-Helaifi issued a tough warning to any club that wanted to deceive one of PSG’s best players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we’re going to go against them, we’re going to make offers to their players,” he said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they have consequences.”
It seems that Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verrati.
PSG has made it clear that it will not release the Italian player to the national team under any conditions, and now, probably, Barcelona is feeling the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neymar.

"On this occasion, I would also like to ask questions to relevant colleagues about how much money is allocated," Putin said at a meeting with the heads of the regions located on the Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Natural Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the full representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District, Sergey Menialo, and the head of the Baikal branch of FGBU "Glavrybvod" Leonid Mikhailik.
They talked about the work of cleaning the lake.
Then they showed malks in an open container next to the container, which were prepared for breeding.
In the beginning, Putin released a few little ones from the sack.
He then pulled a special lever on the container’s cover and released the rest.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to deal with the ecological situation on the Baikal and to build a road on the island of Olhon.
According to the Ministry of Construction, one volume is needed, and a supposedly different volume is provided.
“I want to understand what is happening there with financing,” the Russian leader said.
In the course of forest fires in 2017, the fires covered the settlements of Buryatia, Irkutsk region, residential houses and economic buildings were destroyed.
