The UKIP demented who refuse to accept those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK for medical tourism, and when, with that in mind, he says yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirable.
First you use spicy arguments, then you discredit them with a barely veiled homophobia.
Every time I or my family need the NHS, we have to stand in line behind chronically hypochondriac intolerants who think they're entitled to everything.
I think you're the one who's making the special argument.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing nut jobs, is practically non-existent.
I believe that's what they call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP's measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
It is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a scrap of paper is not evidence.
Yes, shoot the messenger.
The Mail didn't write the report, they just commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or identity either, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage's statement surprised many, but only because it is so rarely discussed.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to get over this.
I'm not sure where you're coming from, but I'm guessing you don't like it when the media talks about what you don't like.
It's rarely talked about because unlike Farage and his crazy Thatcherite followers who think that AIDS and the floods are a sign from God and not a reflection on their own failure to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
Finally, the situation is as bad in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming, the austerity period will not have solved anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland was touted as the 'TIGER OF EUROPE' a few years ago.
We knew the rest !
This is the first time you have read the article.
There is an attempt to make it appear that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a 'NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE' is taking place.
With the Brussels agreement, the lowest societies in Europe are being forced to work in a very flexible way, and emigration is continuing.
With these ingredients, there's nothing to 'pause' at the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 1980s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal as a constant perimeter, and without the new countries, the situation is still better than it was.
Greece was ahead.
The fact that their development has not been a long quiet river is clear in the light of the recent events.
Lowest rate of unemployment in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is real hypocrisy in France on the part of politicians about the taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If we believe a report that came out in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only SMEs pay full price for their products.
Now I can confirm that the traffic is back to the roads, and there are new (and expensive) cars on every street corner, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I've lived in Dublin for 14 years, and the recovery is evident in the daily traffic jams since the beginning of the school year.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon flare up.
In another article they're writing, two Vauxhall Astras are involved in a hit-and-run on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I believe Mr. O'Leary will be buying a whole new fleet of aircraft soon, so a few bumps and scratches on the old ones will be forgotten soon.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I'm hoping it's not on one of these two once they get re-armed.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge passengers extra for the additional fear we were willing to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish enterprise, you couldn't afford to go on a vacation, young man.
I've never been on Ryanair and the last three times I've been on a plane, it was BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can have a good time.
Any article about Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the base fare have to take it out on themselves, etc.
It's pretty clear.
Ryanair will not be happy about the extra costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake by the air traffic controllers at the airport.
Passengers were transferred to another plane in less than an hour, they're not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that is taking the British ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally crowded with people.
People do not come en masse for the quality of the restaurants (a few, mostly) or for the Salon of the magazine in the Espace des Blancs-Mantels (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for the crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With many foreigners spending .....
Do you think opening on Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sundays, packed with 50% tourists.
@aloes False !
The only argument that seems to me to be acceptable is that of areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is tempered by the fact that they buy in retail.
The tourist areas lose a considerable amount of turnover every year for the same reasons.
There is also the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, makes it possible to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right which is enjoyed by employees, with some exceptions.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister responsible for economic affairs nor the Minister responsible for foreign affairs has the least competence to reform the labour code.
So they shut it down.
What's the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and businesses that want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal, on Sundays, I take my grandchildren to the municipal library.
In my town of 30,000 inhabitants in France, the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
That is access to culture...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
The way of life he stood up for against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against her will, used to pay the estate's expenses?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some aren't so bad.
I'm sure his estate would like their share of the cake, if you can say that.
His preference for a Nationalist/Franco victory in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas in general and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
I'm not sure I want to either.
But for five years, and only five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to the other aristos in the government who wanted to discuss a  agreement  with the Nazis and he very cleverly won.
Through his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the belief that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium, and, in the end, the whole world, can thank God that for those five years, just those five years, Churchill was at the helm and no one else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the open market to raise money for the estate expenses, they might even make a profit.
If the public wants to see one in a museum, let them raise the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was the moment of truth, Churchill's personality was a positive asset to his country during the Second World War.
The Commission's proposal is to be adopted by the end of the year, and the Council's proposal is to be adopted by the end of the year.
The social reforms advocated by the Minister reflect the real problem of France's mistrust of dialogue with the European Union.
Back to the values of the princeps.
Reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest among us not be in need!
Either we come to his aid in solidarity, or he has DROIT in return for the services he renders or has returned to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to the SMIC corresponds to this vision.
Then there's the landlord who lives off the property.
There is a difference between those who invest for a return at the time of retirement and those who live on their pensions.
A property to rent or even two for a couple above, it's vice
The little genius of finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The New Deal was a policy of great works, but at a time of great infrastructure shortages.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed world is over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so a New Deal could not be a solution.
The Commission has already taken a number of initiatives to improve the situation in the Community, and it is hoping that the Commission will be able to do so.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less severe, then the need for investment is crying out: insulation, renovation of the railway network, urban transport, transport and storage of energy etc...
A tax that favors the high-income and the rentier.
Who 's in charge ?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is a real horse.
Samsung's profits are being hurt by the iPhone 6 and its competitors in the same range
Apple's introduction in mid-September of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have attracted buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tried all these phones and decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I think it's imperative that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft put this philosophy in place, we had a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have multiple dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I like the design.
Some people don't care about design, they care about options, functionality and price.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for a better platform.
Is there a better car manufacturer? Not really, they're different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches to different people and markets.
It's healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in the interest of all of us.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it wasn't an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our friends in the genre, who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, often on Parisian boobs), could tell us which authors they fight ideas on the genre and indicate the works they intend to fight.
Or do they just tackle the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
So their source is Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, John, I like you, and you're a smart, cultured man.
I said that about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holopherne, a combination that had not come to me (I do not have his quickness of mind).
Otherwise, in the "bottom", since you refer to it, this topic does not interest me, and I honestly do not see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I am slow but I understand well ...
@Jean: You have to admit that culturally , sending Judith back to Holopherne does that .
Who 's afraid of the world ?
But what do we scare the scared of ?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat-slitter.
We can see how much these studies affect the innermost of them.
We are obviously no longer in the debate of ideas.
It's something else, something much deeper.
@Did you read, Jean, that Le Monde published an article on the need for theology?
@: As for a debate of ideas I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
To claim to combat ideas on the basis of the mere presentation made by their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Gender Theory or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me to be very rigorous.
But, as I was explaining to our friend the uncouth, it's the difference between having an informed opinion and just having an opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I settled for the "Second sex" (it was more my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly appeared as the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and made up for the disappointment of sometimes being blocked by clouds.
It was great here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud cover really would have been off the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Special flash of the blood moon.
Tony Abbott/Joe Hockey are holding Labor to account.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will give it its true colour as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with it, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne also managed to cover the entire week of the Perseids meteor shower and virtually all of the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm beginning to think there's an evil genius whose sole purpose is to keep the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are getting much better on the other side of the ridge.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn't see the eclipse because of clouds over the Melbourne suburbs.
I'm gonna put a tax on that eclipse.
Anyone who watches this eclipse should pay a tax.
I bet your first thought of the day is Abbott, just like your last before bed.
Who or what will haunt you when he eventually disappears?
It seems like you spent a lot of time reading the discussions looking for posts where people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
A beautiful picture of the moon over the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is about to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock market speculation or real estate.
Nothing about income inequality between labor and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
The European Union is a very important institution.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments for these recommendations are not given.
No hypertext links to the original documents so that we can form an opinion.
Look at the results of the miracle recipes today, Tuesday, October 15th: in Spain, exports are at their lowest level in five years.
The stock market in Greece is crashing.
But these are examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of around €8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy has assured us that these claims for compensation are unfounded.
What if the Ministry of Economy makes a mistake?
Will the decision-makers who have reaped the political benefit of the notaries' courageous attack have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The sequel in time.
Okay, thank you, JYL.
@lol No the state is not comparable to households in terms of budget management because the state's time horizon is theoretically infinite while the household's is limited by the lifespan of its members.
Moreover, unless public expenditure is considered to be unproductive, it contributes to financing tangible and intangible investments which are the guarantee of future growth and hence of future revenues.
Some answers.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred Hippocratic oath: the health of the profits of the global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all.
That's a great conspiracy theory you got there.
Unfortunately, the truth doesn't match your fantasy.
The medical staff would like to use it, but their hands are tied by the law as written by the politicians.
It's the same situation as the product that causes medical abortions instead of having risky surgical procedures, the shoot rooms safe for drug addicts instead of having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money off drugs.
That's what pharmacists are for.
Since the Liberals want our health care system to be like the U.S. system, you should learn how it works.
All over the world, doctors are being courted in the same way, but it's more or less visible.
It may have been a bad wording to put the blame on doctors, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, are prioritizing corporate profits and research.
So read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme expenditure and on the negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare the world prices of drugs that are everywhere, and the differences from country to country in what is available over-the-counter or prescription-only.
This is reinforced by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are even now testing marijuana inhalations for cancer pain, despite laws that curb them and expensive permits that are required.
While manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy with the use of alternatives such as marijuana, those who can come up with a version that offers good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong. There's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacy.
And this hospital was happy to use it until someone tipped off the head of the hospital.
You can't patent weed.
If researchers in the social sciences did research instead of politics and networking, we could use their work.
A researcher investigates, he doesn't compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
Comparing is pedagogical, not research.
We cannot say  the research is complete  we must apply it  and then in one go  we must experiment at all costs .
If your research is so successful , why do you keep experimenting ?
If your research is not successful why do you ask us to apply it ?
Can you explain to me how a researcher can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics by himself could assimilate mathematics and other subjects more easily?
New technologies allow learning provided that students learn to use new technologies but how could they learn new technologies if they cannot learn?
The Pisa tests are just an indicator, an indicator which allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the point of building a gauge that tells you what's going on, a self-promotion, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to keep sophists and ideologists out of training and to have practitioners teach practitioners.
The Commission has already taken the initiative in the field of the protection of the environment, and it is not the case that the Commission has not taken the initiative in this field.
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it is not possible to expect that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their place in a modern teacher training.
Educational theorists should have no place.
Practitioners, they have to have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon who has only theoretical training and has never been in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems in the education system.
To give more weight to educational theorists would be to destroy it for good.
Your analogy is totally wrong: if I would not like to be operated by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would much less like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the spot.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative MP responsible for the fight against copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
Thank you.
If I ever start feeling guilty about copyright infringement, I'll just have to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement is theft.
It's the same thing, because they have to cite their sources correctly.
In many cases, obtaining a licence is free of charge.
No, this is a copyright violation.
It's not the same thing at all.
By using content without the proper license, you are depriving artists of their livelihood.
You can always argue pedant hypotheses - but this is theft.
And you can say it all you want, but it's not going to turn out to be true.
It's a violation of the copyright.
Go on, say it again.
If I ever start to feel guilty about copyright infringement
You obviously don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should be paid for images used in school assignments, a near-perfect definition of what reasonable use should be, then I'm happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson number one should be to show how, if kids themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they're giving up all intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions that they've gone through with one click.
Maybe if they share their MP3 player headphones with a buddy on the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
If only we could export this resource that we have so abundantly, the whiner who says everything is wrong....
If a member of the Socialist Party says so, then we must believe him.
I have two children and when they are old enough to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed between then and now.
France is pulling people down by continually helping them.
I don't want my children to have to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What's driving France down is speeches like yours.
@gus I have been working in private companies all my life.
I HAVE had the good fortune to work in companies run by excellent business leaders: this is something that exists in France but it is rare.
I'm an employee because I know I don't have the skills to run a company and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the bosses I frequently encounter.
I am totally in agreement with Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he tells the horrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with German companies which French business leaders constantly cite to demand reforms in France, in Germany companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large enterprises and medium and small - What do French bosses expect to do the same?
The state holding their hand?
This state they accuse of being ineffective?
@ Jacques L.
You're always saying that about the business owners!
Remind me, what did you create as employment, as added value, to be so severe?
@Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is facing an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who are languishing and languishing while waiting for permanent assistance from the State!
That's awful!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employer's fees, taxes, working 45 hours a week with 35 paid, and some, trading on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages or their abolition!
I look forward to all the negative comments on this topic.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From where I'm sitting, Last hasn't exactly been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay afloat rather than transform.
That's not to say that Scottish Rail hasn't improved since Last took over.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that.
I've been trying to get them recently, but I haven't been able to.
But, well, Labour's gonna get us out of trouble, aren't they?
It's an international branch.
They already run trains in Germany.
There is nothing to stop people in the UK from creating a more ethical business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at management, most of our privatised services end up being run by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision would be eventually reversed.
And here's the good news: MTR, a Hong Kong company, won the contract to operate Crossrail for eight years.
Well, Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and for sharing and thinks that workers should all help each other across borders.
So we can assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Perhaps it is because the Dutch management is on the right track while the British management is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a fighting girl".
God, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
If we assume that being "battant" is a quality superior to many others, concern for others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "battant" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: the cancer "battants", who have nevertheless died, I know of some.
Getting over an illness has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, we'll do it again too.
I'm not saying it's the condition for coping, I'm saying it helps.
It's not about any merit.
When it comes to the examples of your life, you're the only one who can judge them.
I'll do it again.
To suggest, even for a moment, that one can have merit in getting out of a disease or that one can be demerited for not getting out of it is simply monstrous.
The body follows or it doesn't.
A body that lets loose, from all sides, against the will, against the faith in medicine, do you have any idea what C is?
I'm sorry to think otherwise, but having a strong moral compass probably makes it easier to accept and prepare for heavy treatment, to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not to reject them out of fear.
Someone who is a fighter in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if we prefer to leave it to the "lord" it's another thing.
Not with merit, not with courage.
These are the views of moralists.
When you catch a filth, a real one, you're stripped to the point of being a zombie.
Personally, I've caught two, dirty, fat ones, and if I "hit" like those fine psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is about grinding your teeth, suffering hell and taking the hits.
I thought the indictment against Milosevic had been decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on? What's going on?
It's a birthday party.
It's a forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted  quickly  and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told back then?
The communist turned nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The communist president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ?
Please ask what has been deliberately omitted:
How could NATO bombing be legal under the LEAST rule of international law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
Speaking of RTS, why don't you mention that NATO destroyed this very building by killing civilians, then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no choice: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he'd be swallowed by the Western Compressor Roller.
The Westerners used a smokescreen to detach part of a sovereign state which then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was promptly recognized by the Western states who then lied endlessly about the situation on the ground.
The Serb population has now totally disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term because he failed to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian shouldn't call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we don't like him).
As far as I know, there is only one method of earthquake prediction in Greece that works, measuring the piezoelectric level in the quartz.
Such studies are undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with the water of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus, which is the smallest and coldest planet to have detectable water molecules, according to a study led by the team of Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
That's the way to do it.
Just like the ones involving animals that sense a threat coming.
Thank you, Mr. Science, for delighting us with the many experimental feats that are being made in the world.
How would animals know in advance?
The perception of other elements whose rates change in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas that is not known to be odorless to humans but may be detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable to man, but not to the measuring instruments at his disposal.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed time and again (and for centuries) that some animals behave in strange ways within a few hours of an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on art which described the struggle of two scientific teams, one Californian and the other Japanese, to obtain recognition of the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to the earth's magnetic fields, and more particularly to their modification before an earthquake.
So I'm not a scientist, but their hypotheses convinced me!
Where are we on this research?
Why this contempt for this trail?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If things are examined calmly and thoroughly, it's published in a reputable journal, and no one looks down on it.
When we talk about the "signs" given by animals, we are faced with the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the goldfish was spinning in a strange way.
I don't understand how anyone could think that Boris would make a good leader for the Tories.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program you can't help but think that this man knows nothing and is always trying to divert with a joke.
He never answers anything directly.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the host asked him what he agreed with.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to get elected mayor and he didn't keep a single one.
It just goes to show how much of the rest of the Conservative Party is a piece of shit, doesn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in Have I Got News For You.
Because she's a celebrity and we've been indoctrinated into celebrity worship.
The people of London voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (not if) he takes over the leadership of the party, the Tory popularity rating will go through the roof I'm sure.
God help us all.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but don't want their PM to be one
That's exactly what they said about Londoners.
He should have brought his friend the parpaing, smarter than him.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R. Branson.
The Americans had one as President.
The French have always been disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For those who have taken the trouble to read some books (there are some, including a French one and excellent by B.
Millot), the Solomon Islands and the "Strait of Scrap" speak, as sadly as the dead who remained there.
Understandably, the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, the Australia, must still be at the bottom since the Battle of Savo) would not want to return.
We actually passed the island of Savo, in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission is ending.
It's the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total smog.
Calculate the kerosene consumed to reach the target.
Just browse the list of sponsors that philanthropists.
The Commission is not prepared to do so.
The cow, it makes me want to!!!
I'm looking forward to the webseries!
Your recital makes me think again, identifying myself a little in passing (I also learned to sail with the Crocos from L'Elorn to the Moulin Blanc in Brest!).
I also applaud the ecological message, even though some people criticise the impact of the move.
The end justifies the means.
Keep on showing us, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travellers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago.
I think the red cap who protested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of any kind should not spend a penny of our tax money to fund the dreams of a few adventurers even as sympathetic as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian squad who are of Kosovar origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they are still in the team
It is Bisevac who defends Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a midfielder or forward in the 70s and 80s and coached many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as a striker in the big team of Velez which, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, twice finished in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also counted stars like Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsene Wenger's loyal teammate Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
We were saying he was going to be a great player when he was at Juve, he's currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
I can't help you now.
I know he lost his place when Conte came in, then he went to the Lighthouse and as far as I know he's not a regular there.
He might still be doing something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, you have nothing to fear.
You should like Albania because you're neighbours.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the real Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A little bit of nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (as far as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give up parts of the country to the neighboring countries.
How could one have felt "an explosion of joy" at seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and undoubtedly children were inside?
How can I help you?
What bothers me a little about this "testimony" is that the fact that I was able, even if only once, to spontaneously rejoice at the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies to me of a "borderline" personality whose "testimonies" should be taken with the greatest caution.
In the brief moment of "joy", no doubt the dead and the reality of the horror inflicted were not thought of.
We just thought, for a moment, that for once, Muslims had managed to do a real and apocalyptic damage to the big bad Satan at his very heart.
Do something powerful.
It was great.
It seems that this sentiment was shared by thousands of Muslims who were consumed by their sense of humiliation.
With some footage from Palestine.
The classic Schadenfreude.
We had a feeling.
The "Christian/white/Gaulish" West cannot measure the degree of the frustration, anger, hatred of the Musuman when he contemplates the general misery, social and cultural underdevelopment of the Arab-Muslim world today.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past glory, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How can the Muslim world get out of this diabolical cesspool?
In total synchronisation, two major poisons are irrigating the Arab world: the bigoted conservatism of the powers in place and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
We must not let the Muslims back down.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess that's true in a lot of countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long months of dark, damp, depressing weather that affects the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everybody is getting sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer from it myself.
When the light goes out, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little with mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, rain or no rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of about to die.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a great summer this year, so don't be such a cliché-crazy cliché!
Not all of them.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now that I'm retired and I'm not developing any immunity to germs from outside, that can change, I suppose.
It's not being about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a fever that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawkes, Christmas, the risk of snowfall and many other wonderful words.
Just keep doing things !
Here are my holiday recommendations for you.
Yes, these dark, gray months do make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child allowances, this is the amount collected by the State which is essentially derived from the 8 to 10 deciles.
However , as regards the number of households whose tax liability increased as a result of this measure , it is mainly the fourth and fifth decimal places that are affected (median income) as shown in Chart 2 .
The deletion of the half part especially concerning widows is not addressed at all in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to be fixed.
Well, we're not on the brink of it, but thinkers
For once the PS has made a left-wing policy we will not cry...
It is obvious that those in the top 20% must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let's keep it up and you'll encourage those 20% less to work or leave.
Okay, I know it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and the OCI recycled to the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you're looking at the wrong thing.
The ratio is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from amassing as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is over, money is no longer useful for anything but making money, that is to say, making misery for the greatest number.
We're in the top 20% of the richest people in the world.
The 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, some of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax should allow these households to benefit from a part of their efforts.
Or else we might as well give up and live on social minimum, especially if we have social housing.
The utopias of the Khmer Rouge beheaders have fortunately lived on.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
It's all right.
In one of the two, we had things that you wouldn't have in a five-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or deal with any of the hassles.
You just go to someone's house, sleep there, clean up your mess and go.
From now on, it's my first choice when I'm traveling.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your house.
In most cases you will need some kind of homeowners insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, 6 hours too late.
I love the airbnb.
 It's very dangerous and highly risky  No it's not true.
You just really were out of luck.
From the link in the article:
When he was discharged, Airbnb's response to Teman was quick, almost absurdly quick.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (which Airbnb is insured for, but still).
So why is this article quoting Teman complaining that he didn't get any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hi, I'm looking for people who have used air bnb just to reassure me.
I'm thinking of paying a down payment and a month's rent all at once, but I'm a little afraid of sending £1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
Where are we going?
 Support the troops , the Boughery sang in all the tones...
They're harmless weapons.
I am sure that the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja will be pleased to know that their relatives and friends died from something other than Saddam Hussein's chemical bombings.
Unless the content of the article has been radically altered by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to be polite).
Furthermore, how would this mass murder committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
The author's style is not entirely clear: he's looking for weapons of mass destruction.
We're all in agreement.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to reinforce education, for we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it still time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
We would already be making a great deal of improvement in education if we made them work 35 hours instead of 17.
Our teachers are currently earning more per hour than engineers.
And don't let us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But it is not visible because the National Education has no means to provide a desk in the middle school/high school for its teachers so they work at home.
It is a kind of forced teleworking, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, the internet connection or the supplies.
Besides, it's so busy at 5pm on weekdays and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the CAPES in maths. Come, we're waiting for you.
What do you mean you don 't want to hang out with the rude kids whose parents spit on you and call you a wanker ?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Kurdish population can flourish better.
Where you can see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first job as a graduate was in sales in London, making three times as much as anyone else, and yet it was a job that required a degree.
A year later, I saw an ad for a job on the London Underground, and it was an extra £5,000 a year, and we didn't even apply for a patent.
I never regretted it.
On that note, don't worry if you can't find a job with a degree, try to find something that either pays well or that you like to do.
If I had stayed in graduate school, I'd still be paying off my student loans.
I don't like working in a corporate environment so much, so I hope to eventually move into either the civil service or academia.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year lag.
The best way to reduce the number of graduates without jobs?
Get rid of the fancy fields like art/literature/theatre/media/philosophy/political science, that is to say the so-called degrees of the unemployed.
I got one of those degrees and ended up a production manager.
It turned out that what was important was not the degree but, as the above article says, a good career path, beginning in school and throughout college.
The starting salary was lower, but you move up the ladder quickly because in the real world, it's more about results than knowledge.
This engineering studies/artistic streams debate has been going on for years.
Scientists can't solve all problems, it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people in a way that produces results.
Letters, philosophy and art are all the same?
This is ridiculous.
I assume you're talking about degrees like media studies or whatever the hell field you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real fields.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn't it be better to have a real territorial policy to disrupt Paris and energize the rest of France?
Personally, I can hardly imagine the people from the lower Essonne and Val-d'Oise cycling 80 km back and forth to work in Paris every day.
The inhabitants of the intra-muros and the small belt already have many other more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and locked parking lots, as they already exist in northern European cities such as Dijon and Lyon, will be installed on the roads.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, space is being cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, we hope that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
We should benefit from their vast experience in this field.
Well, we couldn't find a place for ONE bicycle hanging device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, that's not good at all.
When we talk to pedestrians and other users of public transport about the reasons why they do not pedal, it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1 / it is hyper dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that drive super fast and don't care about the survival of bicycles 2 / we get full of pollution in the head For me, cycle lanes are a go-go, we have to reduce car traffic (urban pedestrian congestion), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), make the road code be observed by systematically writing (even bicycles with a pedal seat that must be adapted to the road code for bicycles 100 years ago), generalize the buffer zones after the blocked passages, if not before bicycles and scooters do not generate.
The cycle paths are apartheid, we have to live together but re-balance the occupation of urban space.
Anything about cycling in the greater Paris?
Not a word about biking on public transport ?
EELV is right.
The 15% cycling target is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to think Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Moreover, according to OR, the EELV deputies seem to be sceptical.
I'd rather be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, we'd better find out who's really behind this massacre.
Clue: it's not Russia.
I'm not sure I like the way the world is going.
It looks awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to take the case to the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
And they would have to file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be deferred pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the criminal investigation that would follow.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not at fault, the fault lies with the authority in charge of airspace security, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident foreseeable?
Other planes had been shot down earlier, Ukraine was launching air strikes against the rebels in the area and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Did the Ukrainian government take reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or did it choose to gamble with the lives of innocents so that airlines would pay for flying over the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurper government/ultranationalists in Western Ukraine - and who want to demonstrate basically that Putin shot down Flight MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what happens in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 ruling by the International Court of Justice that concluded that the CIA's supply of arms to the Contras rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There's no way Russia's gonna let this go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott wants to tell Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators have said nothing of the sort.
To be called Ricardo and be such a beggar in eco, it is depressing!
To be called Polar is to lose the North is to rejoice.
One simple question: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can't help but notice that the most virulent critics of Piketty's book have not read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of income from work, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the long term.
It shows that the concentration of capital today joins that of the beginning of the 20th century before 1914, it shows that it was the 2 world wars that lowered the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration recovers afterwards...
Bernajuzan: what are you saying no to?
I ask you how long it took you to read this paving stone knowing that the ability of an individual to concentrate has some limits.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is correct, one can debate it without reading the book whose essential point is to argue one way in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read.
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his platform summarized by the press false?
I haven't read it and I won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis, which seems to me to be pure nonsense.
The gap between rich and poor is a subsidiary concept.
Hasn't humanity, as a whole, gotten richer?
And this enrichment plus population growth is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and she definitely deserves the award.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age when most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope this award will not be a burden to the young girl and that she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that the colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
I wish Malala all the best, but she must realise that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or anywhere else - not even in the working class areas of Britain!
Did anyone think his speech was a little strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she hadn't been where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Isn't Malala herself one of these colorful perverts?
You shouldn't have any airtime on this site.
You are a horrible pervert yourself.
This is absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her off at 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
Her father runs a school where girls are enrolled and is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and always has been, that she receive a higher education and that she has the right to decide for herself about her marriage.
But he is unusual in Pakistan in that he believes that women are equal to men.
What she was saying was that the average Pakistani girl is often forced to get married at 14, without having a say in it.
I'm sorry she didn't articulate that in a way that was meaningful enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that, if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14.
I'm disappointed with this season four entry, and especially with Jessica Lange, who's obviously having a little trouble finding her Marlene Dietrich look-alike.
I've just watched the last two seasons which are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!
A fascinating first episode.
The production is near perfection and Jessica Lange's performance of Bowie's "Life on Mars" is simply stunning.
I haven't watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I'd rather have it all happen to me than watch 13 episodes spread over three to four months.
But one thing is for sure, aside from the extraordinary Jessica Lange, it was mostly the risks of staging and editing that got me.
AHS has a flood of original plans that make a mockery of the sanitization of today's productions.
It's a little bit surprising to see you throwing in the towel in advance for the next few seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is a pillar of this show, but, as you so well say, there's so much more.
It's not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series apart from the technical qualities.
And I'm looking a lot for her.
Then I find that the show fails at writing, it wants to do too many things at once.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing ten seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end like a 24-hour thing.
But everyone does what he wants, right?
It 's because I say I 'll never look at it again that everyone else has to do the same !
I'm just sharing my point of view, nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it will be fatal to her.
But then again, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - let's cut in government spending instead.
No, let's increase the spending please.
Those who wanted to cut back on expenses failed.
To start polemics about relatively small items of expenditure, such as development aid
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that the voters seem to be calling for and all the while some on each side are pretending that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and the voters see through their game and find them to be bad faith.
Less than 1% of the cost.
The  debt  is assets held mainly by financial institutions in this country.
The  debt  is nothing to worry about.
I would have no problem with the government taking a third of my income (not to mention consumption taxes) if I thought it would be put to good use.
But it's not, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
Nigel Farage is said to have been not entirely honest about how to reduce taxes but well, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, almost useless wind subsidies and nuclear plants that cost twice what they should, you get a figure that makes the Labour and Lib Dem tax on the most luxurious residences look pretty ridiculous.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 a year will pay around £5,000 (one-seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (one-fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 will pay around £70,000 (a little over one-third).
What about social security ?
Plus social contributions, plus local taxes, plus parking fees and car registration fees, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is withdrawn at source before local taxes and the car registration fee.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let's not pretend that money is falling from the sky or that it doesn't matter where billions of pounds of tax dollars are going.
How can an unemployed person who is looking for work door-to-door prove it ?
Although 20% of the unemployed would not look for work, that means 80% look for work and don't find it.
Being unemployed myself, do I have more interest in what other people are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances of success.
I haven't heard from the Employment Service in months, so does that mean that the agents are more busy checking things than actually getting job advertisements in?
I don't see the point.
Because it's not the state's job to provide work.
If Pole Emploi doesn't provide enough jobs, then we need to do without Pole Emploi.
How is this a sensitive issue?
We all have rights and duties, and in this case we are making sure that the unemployed do their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks for their transport licence from the users of a means of transport, a head of department or the employees of their work, etc.
Nobody shouts out in these cases, do they?
It is indeed worth recalling that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with Pôle Emploi, my rights to LARE had been misstated, and on one of the cases, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight hard.
It takes time !
I'm not a legal expert.
The register and control are now taking over, while Pôle Emploi is statutorily close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the issue of compensation should concern only employees, they are the ones who pay the contributions.
Politicians and unemployed Frenchmen give themselves rights they don't have!
It's not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance scheme contributes to the value of paid work.
More than waiting for murderous tweets in Arabic...
In reality we need to have a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop ISIS so that this virus does not reach that conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with war and population movements at the time.
The Saudis have had the presence of mind to ban Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries from performing the Hajj to Mecca this year.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have had their visa applications rejected because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was a case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hajj in the 1980s, probably from a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world has the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to suggest that Ebola patients should not be allowed to board a plane to Europe?
I thought it was common sense but apparently those who know have decided that we can risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those countries in West Africa where Ebola is out of control should be put in strict quarantine.
No one is getting out.
Only medical personnel are allowed in.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can go away.
If they get Ebola while they're there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were infected after coming into contact with people in West Africa despite taking all the necessary precautions.
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
We must forbid them to offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be immediately quarantined.
He gets to get the message across from the individual first and the group (including religious) second and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt he's capable of dogmatizing the image of God that is characterized by the total functioning of the cortex of the planet.
It is still far from that conception there.
It's only been 20 years since information emerged as the prize given to humanity, while religion, born of the brain, has guided our actions since, perhaps, Lucy.
What is the point of becoming just another Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is a large minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Critics would not set foot in the church anyway, just considering the small number of Protestants in France.
What's the next step, we take away the notion of sin, too "anxiety-inducing"?
@louise: Sorry the church doesn't have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe this will reach more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you see it pre-existed Christ.
Hillel a century before him had already said: "Do not do to others what you do not want done to you, that is the whole Torah and the rest is only commentary: go and study!"
Christianity goes far beyond simple reciprocity and introduces agape.
Your "promotion of justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is this a return to communism?
Next step, we remove the incarnation and resurrection.
Jesus will remain the hero who overturned the moral laws by redefining the respect of others.
The European Union must be prepared to play its part in the ethical debates in our societies and to promote justice, peace and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think the reason there are so few Protestants in France is mainly because their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and forced to emigrate a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming soon.
You can't make that up.
Personally, I would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even did the fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you're interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM for £30 and also offering a 20% discount coupon.
Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM for £30 and also offers a 20% discount coupon.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The computer department's jock-knocks are blocking all the cool sites.
Hello, is it £30 and then 20% off, or does the £30 include the 20% off?
Warning: the PC version is only for DX11.
I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refunds, it sucks.
It's time to get a new video card.
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam account, I believe.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'm afraid that one day they'll erase it from your library if they decide to crack down on people who buy it there when they're out of the designated area.

So, was France in 1940 a "putrid land"?
I'm telling you, this Nobel Prize sounds like a poisoned gift to me.
You have to like the France of the 40s, the one of "the strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature you wonder if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, we don't even want to read the prize-winning authors.
Will Brazilians, Chinese or Australians read Modiano which is already difficult to read in French and which describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relation with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize ?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and the rest, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, they are.
They 'll appreciate it .
Modiano at his best, if they don't already know him!
And you, keep seeing Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso are still in the lead.
So let 's see who won the Nobel Prize for Literature:
Painter in 2005, D.
Hello, you creep.
Ever since I drove one of these in Iceland, I keep seeing Kia Sportages everywhere.
I think this thing followed me here.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me up like the horrible computer in Superman III?
Hello Dantra, still the hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I've had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham beer and cider party.
It was a mess.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, with Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, it was not just CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a buddy's grandfather's house to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner's luck I was able to start with several decent bets.
I hope when I'm 95 I'll be as smart as he is.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire Mr.
Read a little Buddha and you'll see how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to offend you, I think you're getting a little off topic.
This famous law prohibits the pursuit of jihadists outside mosques.
She reports weapons trafficking immediately.
Either you have your eyes wide open like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or you have your eyes wide closed.
You have to choose.
It's not by keeping your eyes closed that you get to the light.
Forgive me, Christian, but once again you are making a monumental contradiction: the totality of the authorities, representative organizations or associations, Muslims or not, having formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Whoever says nothing agrees.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like Frenchmen.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt is something that exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt that French Jews approve of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them of this a priori and to demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that they are wrong to doubt.
In my view, this principle is a negation of the republic and can only contribute to the disintegration of French society.
If there is no doubt, say so.
Who says "consent", but consent to what?
Consent to proximity with ISIS or condemnation of ISIS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to spare the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections,  take revenge  on the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has been created between their proposals for decentralisation and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at the thought of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing his ass off.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't give a shit about Scotland because they don't have a seat there.
They can do whatever they want with complete electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good thing in the long run for him and the Conservatives.
Who's gonna shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They're going to be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who are going to cut their heads off in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the PROOMES thinking he was saving his party but not realizing he was signing the death warrant for his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are calling their leader to account.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats are not from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralisation.
I think that's the important thing.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected in England.
To pump the pumps by 8% at the expense of 85% is not a great electoral strategy.
Furthermore, once Scottish MPs can no longer vote on matters affecting England, the Conservatives will win every vote.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and it worked out well for her.
However, he is still in contention to be Prime Minister in 2015 and has been since winning the leadership of the Labour Party.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind every reader to look over their shoulder and see what they're reading, how they're reading, and all the way through.
It's the lives of others of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Still the same fascination with surveillance techniques.
In the long run, it will at least have a sterilizing effect.
And now, Amazon is making YOUR book based on YOUR profile and doing it automatically through a secret algorithm!
It's a happy world.
Very stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
Since DRM management is not implemented under this system, I am left with pirated files, public domain books or books purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a trail.
Considering the price I paid for the Kobo, it's no regret.
I am appalled by the widespread abandonment of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your general store, you will notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are arguably paltry.
For example, Finnegans Wake by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the age of Big Data, data doesn't really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same bin.
Collecting anonymous data when there's a profile...
The harvest is not anonymous.
The data published by Kobo are the only ones that are authentic, since they do not allow the identification of the readers or authors.
But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, wrong and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic kids on acid.
It's even worse than that if you factor in Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It's interesting that some of Erdogan's supporters think Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine.
:-P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot itself in the foot unless it gains something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will strike back, so it's effectively shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog:  The AP reports that Iran has warned the US that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad as it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear from the article whether Iran was sending a stern warning of retaliation or simply advising caution.
The second option is more likely, and in any case, what is really surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic engagement is about Syria, Israel and the security of the region.
The short article you link to is important and should be read with the previous realistic observations/warnings from Iran about Afghanistan around 1979-1980.
Who are these "moderates" who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
The politics of pipelines is pushing the world into the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to nonexistent  moderates  to pay more attention to the facts and the alternatives before sending other people's children to fight in World War III.
 It's even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism  Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
We should have a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide by the Turks.
Should I ?
You do realize that neither the perpetrators nor the victims have any chance of surviving?
A little late for that, my friend...
Aren't the criminals barely old now, like 120?
A little late for that, aren't you?
Particularly concerning the triumvirate of the CUP that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the 1st World War out of revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a remote place of Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a fool !
An impressive mastery of the sophistication of the fatal slope, but other than that, we seek in vain contact with reality.
Just clichés without any argument.
The fetus will always hear a heartbeat even in the womb of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may simply want children and not want to be accepted.
Same with sterile straight couples.
What about the children?
It's a shame to label them as future psychopaths.
One day they'll be old enough to defend themselves, to say they're happy to live, to earn their living and to pay for this lady's pension (?)
The GPA is probably a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine in our world.
It's not from today.
Many women have been pregnant and given birth to children who were not their husbands.
It's still the way it is, it's the way we're made...
The important thing is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, cosmetics, aren't they also body merchandising?
I 'm not going to do it .
It is certainly more elegant to fatten a maid in a distant country via the Internet and Pay Pal than to assume its responsibilities and or to avoid scandal in another century near home without shouting it at this time on all rooftops! ...
These practices were not done in the name of the church either!
It's not just Christians and believers who reject these practices...
But the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, this man is passionate about something.
In the late '70s in the Midlands, I've only seen it from afar.
I had to go in the daytime because I wasn't allowed to go at night!
But if you like it and you listen to the music -- that music today still touches you just as much.
I don't know why there are so many disparaging comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on football that is awaiting your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there's been a dearth of news stories that truly reflect the reality of Northern English culture.
No wonder Paul Mason has a good grasp of the social and political context, he understands things.
The Northern soul is still alive, but it's been vampirized by capitalism and today it's essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can check it out if you're in the London area in November: 99psoul will be playing soul records again, including full Northern soul, on Saturday November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I thought the same thing, but here's a well-written and well-thought-out article.
Your criticisms really need to be more constructive.
That's a great article.
I loved your documentary.
I suppose you're happy to be out of Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.
By swallowing pills.
Although the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently detective series entitled Gently Northern Soul, which is set in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is getting more and more toxic.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu is not looking for peace because he wants to continue occupying-colonizing (by the way, Rabin was too).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents all preferred occupation-colonisation to peace.
He took off his clothes, laid them on the rock and jumped into the water.
An Israeli stole them from him.
The Israeli representative stood up in anger and shouted: "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren't even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not let down their guard ...
That the anti-Israel people don't like it is obvious, it's not the goal...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the world geopolitical report ...
And it 's always been like that since politics became globalized ...
Avoidance, avoidance, and then you're out of the loop.
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it continues!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What relationship of forces allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a power struggle today!
You doubt that?
Besides, it's not just Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have a hard time getting past anything he doesn't have to say.
A lot of what he says is just pseudo-Shomskyist gibberish written by others.
This is proof that you don't understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It's just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes him, which would imply that it's a matter of immaturity).
A truly vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths that we'd rather not think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to get more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks in a pretentious way and after all the tabloid nonsense he does seem to be a novice populist, but this whole no-voting thing has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that he's just telling people not to vote and instead to fold their arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at the Paxman interview and other articles/videos he's posted, he says that voting once every 5 years for Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I guess) and limiting democratic engagement to that is completely useless, the two parties (to slightly different degrees) essentially ruling in favour of special interests, multinational corporations and the rich, and he's not saying to just completely ignore politics because these parties are not ruling in our name: he's just insisting that to vote and disconnect, people should become much more politically active for five years, from organizing political movements, from petitions, from local, and whatever, from the very little.
I'm not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active by presenting your demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are puppets who will change their mind if they really risk losing the elections), but it's infuriating to see all these condescending responses that say that this idiot who is Jesus is telling young people not to bother voting and just to hope that everything will be better because it really distorts his arguments.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people debated what he actually said rather than simply labelling him as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The whole vote thing was completely twisted.
The pointlessness of slipping a ballot into a ballot box every five years deeply annoys me, since my vote really doesn't count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and members of Parliament who are accountable to their constituents locally.
Furthermore, I dispute the idea that the words of Russell Brand are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own sayings and ideas, even if these are heavily influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group together under the label  pseudo-chomskyist bilingual .
I'm pretty sure that in a debate he'd be able to convince Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, have Suzanne do Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a verandah, even with the added nodding in the edit!
Like Max Keiser, who was attacking Russell at first but ended up becoming a fan and inviting him on his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he's going with this.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by the mainstream media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This leaflet reveals above all to me that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the RDV of history where professional historians have become a minority and where the exchange of specialists has been impoverished in favour of condensed ready-to-thinkers like Sciences Po for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take on a guilty party, a goat-eater.
They both develop very rational reasoning, but this rationality is based on these scapegoats who are the keystone of their thinking.
I think that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
We solve the problem of the relation to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-liberal and/or/liberal tendency (the second of the two terms marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing how to seek the help of the state for its markets) in the sense of at least state / no state at all with Foucault.
The old dream of the base that is self-organizing beautifully.
Its thinking is built on the guilt of the State: without this guilt it cannot stand.
Guilty means elimination, murder means sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
No support whatsoever.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its god of the time, Stalin, the grandfather of the people.
Oulala, you probably read a shouya too fast if you took Foucault's writings on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would not have fun attacking Michel in this way...
Gauchet reflects deeply on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the mechanism of membership in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by hard-line left-wing humanist researchers who can't stand that we dispense with allegiance to their mantras, is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is unlimited.
An important point to be added seems to me to be the attitude of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other  yellow  I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You haven't had the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where in Russia was it that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I can't remember the last time I saw a Chinese man.
In London and they were sympathetic to me when they found out I was Russian.
In Russia here -- in the 1990s, the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same of whites !
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou long ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them making violent anti-white remarks.
My father's not happy about his oldest daughter dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in the last few years: they are getting richer and richer, prosperity spreads outside the big cities, and because of this prosperity people travel abroad and see how other people live.
From what I have been told, Russians are especially prejudiced against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are highly likely to be exploited by their employers or face high levels of crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenisei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I've heard the opinions of Australians about the Chinese and Aborigines.
It's really strange for a stranger to tell me that I can't stand Chinese people, when I've met two of them in my life (including one abroad), have no bad memories of them, everyone is good and, in fact, the people in London were very nice, which is the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise, you won't remember who you met, everyone is the same, how can you remember who was who?
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here speak of the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you still go out with that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with white women, by comparison?
None, because there's a good chance that the parents of these white women would physically assault them.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left like the magistrates' union...
@Marabout: Sorry, but the judiciary is frankly brand a right.
In the Magistrates' Union, he represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be made from the relativity of the application of the laws in the courts, it requires the removal of two obstacles.
The political view of the observer is as much the same as the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It then remains the legally mandated tool for refocusing assessment on fundamentals.
The extent to which the law has not been complied with in all judicial acts by magistrates, including the prosecution, makes it necessary to draw a distinction between error and the partiality of magistrates.
It would be futile to say that the acts of justice are not distributed among these three groups.
The claim and the lack of knowledge are not subject to objective analysis.
And if all this is not analysed, how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics implicitly revealing that it starts from very low.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to inscribe the following in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
The Court of Justice has not been able to establish that the Commission's decision to initiate proceedings in respect of the infringement of Article 85 (1) of the Treaty was based on the fact that the Commission had not been informed of the facts.
The field in question is that of the spoliation* of heirs committed by means of procedural fraud* by succession genealogists commissioned by notaries.
The profession earns almost €150 million a year, and it benefits from the protection* afforded by the near-impunity* of the French notary.
To understand their mechanism, some of them have been reported in the comments following the first publication.
In addition to the statistical improvement* mentioned in the previous comment, the judicial institution has produced, in numerous disputes between genealogists and heirs who are reluctant to be spoiled, a whole set of case-law contrary to all the laws favourable to heirs.
Is the presentation of European statistics without any such rational criteria not then an elaborate form of deception?
Prices that are probably prohibitively high.
More equipment to rip off the handicapped.
You could say that, but my brother has one of these all-terrain tricycles, custom-built for his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like a normal wheelchair, with bulky wheels and tires, could never do.
As they say, the tastes and the colors...
The Tankchairi looks like something Jeremy Clarkson might have invented for a Top Gear challenge.
The Tankchair looks like an EPIC.
I don't think the inventor of the Whill ever had to clean dog poop off a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra-long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for longboards.
There are some hills here they'd like.
The prices seem high, but there are people who put such prices on a bike, so you know.
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, though.
Many of them have insurance policies of reasonable value.
Only if they've become disabled.
The thing is, the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to charge high prices for things that they know we need.
You can't really say the Whill is minimalist.
It's an example of over-design.
Unfortunately, it's just a draft, there's no plans to make it.
I'm glad the wheelchair  long distance  isn't coming to market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, in intensive bombing of densely populated residential areas.
Two million people have been trapped by the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people under the age of 18.
The eight-year-old children have lived under the Israeli blockade all their lives!
This is a situation that is unique in the world, unacceptable and illegal, since this blockade inflicts a collective punishment on all civilians in Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs who work on their projects divert a small amount of their cement to the black market " ...
It's not a wooden tongue, it's a concrete tongue and the lady is armed...
References are there to support an argument or a fact.
Anti-Zionist , you know .
Good cement goes into the tunnels!
There is the black market, that's for sure, and it's acknowledged.
Two million people have been trapped in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A situation unique in the world, unacceptable to anyone with a heart and a moral sense.
The U.S. has a very well-guarded ground: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn't have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by who you know) excluded him!
Don't forget that after lifting the blockade, Morsi re-established it!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I'm going along with it.
Jonathan , I need you to ...
The blockade is Israeli-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live in an underground fortress, built against the backs of the people who chose their masters!
It's a lot of work to have a boat, Aleks.
I hope you've thought this through.
Couchsurfing is way cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the sharing economy, not for profit.
A lot of people are just looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping to get paid) in a different way.
It's always a lot cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, owners and renters who trust each other often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this?
What does she rent on the street?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
We don't use the verb  to let  in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to do business on it (which they will most certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (honestly) on Airbnb, in short, it's really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The barges are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would still be near where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants coming here and attacking our boats...
Where are you going to moor it?
No, Marine Le Pen is wrong!
Populism ?
There is no truth but the truth that exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
Over 150 000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's for what?
In 2017 the mass will be said !
Capitalism is not going to be impoverished!
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies, our jobs, our raw materials, our purchases, our food, our food, our health care, our debts, our institutions.
They are a threat to our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold..
All for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obesity money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance".
It was 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild banker as Minister of Economy, in order to better defend the interests of the banksters, who were responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Wasn't there anyone else who could?
What do you call that, flip his jacket, pull his pants down?
Primary and populist reaction
We don't really know what Marine Le Pen is thinking.
Where did you see this ?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee really refused to rescue the survivors.
One of the aspects of this battle is that neither side seemed to be sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book  Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was rough at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still rough at the end of the battle?
Likewise, the fighting ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, the Battle of the Malvines, where the pictures of the survivors being rescued show a calm sea in broad daylight.
Moreover, the rescuers knew that there were no German fighters in the area at that time.
Hmm, that doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
 There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two battlecruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after ceasing fire, and a pursuit race began.
Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he got closer, he saw it was nothing but a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, bent and badly damaged but still moving.
After pointing his spotlights at the ship's flag, the offer to surrender was refused and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
With no reliable information, von Spee concluded that the Good Hope had escaped and called off the search at 10:15 p.m.
Concerned by reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he set sail for the north.
So, if this is true, the Germans, groping in the dark before the invention of radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have damaged them badly, so in confusion they set off to take advantage of their advantage.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they would have to fight their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half their ammunition, condemning them when they were finally caught.
Several voices are rising in the UMP to demand that it be written into the law that an elected official who has been definitively convicted is therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would certainly also affect elected officials on the left.
But no, this is a joke.
I propose an inscription on the walls of the magistrates' court.
When will the unions be banned in the protected areas?
How long will we tolerate this distortion of equality between citizens?
The political parties, whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, are always quick to appease those who will take advantage of their immovability to hinder the actions of the real politicians, who really try to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is the measure of their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway at noon with their little signs "money for justice" they were from the provinces and did not know the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized trade unions whose members use the enormous power they hold to serve their party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing or even far-right trade unions were to target figures on its side and wage a media-legal war against them.
Your claims are totally gratuitous.
If the right wing is currently flouting the judicial agenda, it is simply because it has committed acts that fall within its remit!
We have no example of a leftist personality who has had so much to do with Justice but not all who have been the object of his attention have had favourable treatment.
On the other hand, it should be remembered that the left-wing magistrates' union is not the only magistrates' union and that it is a minority.
That a minister should be so committed to supporting trade unions shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you are referring to may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancellery, it is no secret.
Now we wonder if the "mission" of some judges is not more to dirty than to instruct.
@gus - You should be pleased, the SM is in the minority.
What are you complaining about ?
@Pivoine: you forget that magistrates are not civil servants like other people: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody ? What is it ?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
How are you?
I think even the most glory-hungry moron realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I'd be surprised if anyone would take them up on their offer.
Many have used it as a stepping stone to a successful career.
One Direction are filling stadiums all over the world.
Others have gone on to sell many records or have moved to the West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these shows, was launched by Chreyl Cole, who, by the way, is on the judging panel.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, they all competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, as did many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and all the rest have been in contests in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars on British television.
Of course, some of them have been forgotten.
But that's what happens to most stars who don't compete in the pageant anyway.
Few people, after one tube, manage to make more.
Anyway, most singers/bands can only hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, only has fans in the UK.
Her fame comes in part from her marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock-and-roll path, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar-playing pranksters who smoke weed in their dad's garage and swing three chords on a grade-school-level poem will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to hit before they even release an album.
And even worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the educated people - a distance that quickly turns into racism, because the ethnologists present these distant people as infinitely superstitious and full of ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing things are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, by practical considerations in everyday life.
Except you recklessly interpret it the other way.
But rather than saying that the drum is devoid of any sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières are also devoid of any sacred character?
Our bias is like a reminder to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
It's the deco ephemere to furnish the void.
That's all I know.
That's a great article. Thank you.
The recent pantheonisation of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacredness still lives.
Who believes in the interpretations of the archaeologists ?
Any other discipline would throw off the whole of the non-scientific interpretations that last a lifetime of a Mandarin, rarely less.
When is a critique of the disciplines compared to laughing a little?
Because what is true of archaeology is also true of the interpretations that other disciplines give.
That would be a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified !
It is thanks to them that treasures are constantly being discovered, valuable testimonies to reconstruct history, to understand societies, and the example of comparative archaeology here is exciting.
This method is not very old and before that archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and knowledge and could be wrong.
Nowadays we have such powerful technical and scientific means that the interpretation of excavations is better but can always be called into question by other discoveries!
There is a full (and old) controversy over shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf. his book Les chamanes de la préhistoire, particularly the augmented re-edition of the scientific controversy, published by La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could do it.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't just keep it to three.
This journal is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the ditch ?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We couldn't watch a musical on that, but that would be too gay!
I thought you might say that.
It's like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost up, may I suggest you switch to the Catholic Times?
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, brave journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Rather than make me laugh with those childish ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Then you can go.
If these... puerile ass jokes... shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
Did you also know that this paper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is entirely possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
However, amateur video of the crash is found on the net...
Amateur crash video on the net... ??
If the FOM chose not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no way those of the pilot.
If FOM wanted to protect the drivers, it would have taken out the safety car at the moment when another vehicle (for example, a car breaker) entered the circuit.
But we had to finish quickly before the typhoon we knew was coming, but for which FOM did not think it was good to advance the time of departure (TV rights, pubs, money...).
But other than that, they're very protective of the pilots.
Well, I agree with that.
But there is also the fact that if the very British FOM brings the SC in, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to beat the Englishman who was leading then...
You're freaking out on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But that's okay, I've got a little time to sort out all your shit.
No, just not.
There have been a lot of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts commissioners in mortal danger for a distant story of one driver's chance of victory at the expense of another.
It's not FOM that puts the safety, it's the FIA.
Shade of waist.
In view of the amateurish images, the absence of images allows the FIA to avoid the embarrassing questions of the type: How is it that the Commissioner waves a green flag in the middle of the intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the stewards is clearly seen waving a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that we are no longer under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark misunderstanding of F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag after the accident, hence the green flag waved.
This is the usual procedure.
The police station just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) waves the green to tell the pilots to return to normal pace.
The sensationalism is what sells the advertising.
I used to think that the media was part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that in the end it's all about money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having sex, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex lives.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Making a buzz with information that we really don't need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so we can keep controlling them.
 When the tabloids are talking about Ebola, we all get scared  It should be  freaked out , not  coughing .
Given the medical reference,  to cough  is much better said in this context than  to derail .
I wonder if all the people who are worried that Ebola could start spreading through the air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You give them too much credit.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You got Ebola mixed up with Murdoch.
Great article, thank you!
A short, concise article that beautifully and solidly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
That was a good laugh.
It depresses me that the media talks about most things with this optimism upside down.
The goal is to keep us scared and anxious enough (without becoming hysterical) that the government can slip us when it needs to.
I think it's perfectly logical that if we have to have a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from a crisis that it has created.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of ruling by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and for still being of this world almost 35 years later.
It must have been horrible at first, given the context of the 1980s and 1990s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of spending years there .....
Completely unnecessary witnessing.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only are testimonies useless, but taken in isolation, they cannot be used as scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonies cannot be used as scientific material.
Maybe that's why people don't ask questions of patients in psychiatric wards when they have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric records say that my mother, a psychiatrist, explained that I was raised telepathically by her mother-in-law.
So this is an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Why is it that the testimony of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and the effectiveness of the new treatments) is of no use in a scientific approach?
Then what's your research based on?
On what ?
You equate fanciful theories with facts ?
 Resilience : the trash word adored by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think of themselves as great psychologists after reading Dansembourg.
@Jim: There are a lot of meaningless buzzwords in psychiatry.
Cyrulnik has done us the coup of the  resilience .
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he has devised a reliable scale of measurement to quantify this resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company?
Doesn 't that remind you of Team America ?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to take the Sentinels off the air...
Why would you do that ?
It was a great show, and it seems like those who make it through know it!
So let us leave our salvation to the Almighty who can perform miracles.
But how are they gonna get the kids to hang ?
The only solution I can think of is the pee-pee-pee humor, which would kill the show.
It was already a children's show.
The kids were hanging out.
Oh, because it's a children's show?
The UKIP are working for the Mysterons.
Keep your Team America.
Still in the Super Mario League ?
It won't be the same if we don't see the wires and the animation is done well. :-)
I can't wait to see this (even though I'm an adult), but I hope it gives a chain the idea to re-air the old ones.
The show has almost never stopped airing here in Australia; we've had hour-long episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6 o'clock for at least 40 years.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it has been on one of the second-rate commercial channels and can still be seen at these times.
And the half-hour episodes are now airing at 5:30 a.m., Monday through Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a sad, 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch that show every day!
There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the Esplanade Mosque!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In fact, all the Israeli excavations under and around the Esplanade Mosque for several decades have yielded nothing.
The Temple Mount, if it exists, is somewhere else.
Can it be in Argentine ??
This hill is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the mosque platform was built.
Its summit, or Dome of the Rock, stands out in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
Muslims believe that Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
To the Jews, it's Mount Moriah, where Abraham nearly sacrificed his son Isaac.
Once it's been taken and contextualized, it's not propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remind them regularly, and unfortunately they are passed on to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and has continuously blown it up!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful event.
Will God be able to recognize his own?
The shortest joke in Jewish history: "Praise be to God!"
To boast about tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naïades half-naked, lying on the beach.
The reality, as usual, is far from what the advertisement shows us, as you can see in the picture below.
It's a little scary, though.
And that picture is a beautiful piece of propaganda!
It's a pity that the Reuters photographer did not take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who preferred to keep the Jewish worshippers down below, praying at the Western Wall.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, you have every right, it's not the newspaper or the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she conveys that should be condemned.
This system is unsustainable and will end in tears.
The only way to end this system is through revolution.
Since the economy seems to be going into a tailspin, big companies have taken enormous advantage of their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to pay more, while at the same time, and without any hiding, they have given ever-greater pay to the small elite at the top.
You're right, it's not sustainable, but it's only going to change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of whining and moaning when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not just about their problems, but also shows your employer that you don't piss people off with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case, it's sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you forgot is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where the social and environmental conditions are the worst.
China and India, for example.
This can't all end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that it's held up.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of corporations owned by these people by bypassing national governments through secret tribunals.
It sounds incredible, but that is exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people to the unimaginable damage this agreement will do to our lives.
It's only recently that we started talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you'll understand what is being negotiated behind your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
These are great returns, whereas digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automobile market.
This gentleman is right, in the 18th century there were unions in all the regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (or her officers, or anyone else, nobody knows) believe that she is the stronghold of France's eternal values, and she will fight and keep her mouth shut.
And then with the decline of the country, globalisation, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic is comforting.
Even though it's getting more and more uncomfortable for her.
You still lack the union of married men, of single men, of married women, of single men, of stray dogs and I don't know what else.
If you can't spell French correctly, I'll join the union.
You've been warned, this will be your fault.
The protection of the interests of the categories of workers is already sufficiently affected by the protection of the professions with trade unions, which has created a break with the equality of other citizens.
We're asked not to laugh about fear of risk from a public official.
It is possible to imagine a system which ensures a certain degree of freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike, as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, it's a disaster.
And with the carts being prepared, the government is welcoming it.
What security are you talking about ?
Ignorance is bliss.
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since that is the subject here commented...
Let us remove the words "through its delegates" from Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
All workers participate in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of enterprises.
This is absolutely essential with the irruption of information power.
And yet you opened, presumably read and commented on an article specifically titled  The Great British Bake Off review . ?????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it was Joffrey's wedding I was watching, and I can tell you that some of it was well-seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (though misleadingly: it was the wine) in the history of television.
Also, the pie is...
The game of thrones!
I love the GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the least bad baker; no one has done the kind of  boom, here is my fucking cake now eat it and bow before your master  !
Maybe the added pressure from friends and relatives outside finally had an effect on them?
In the weeks before, all these outsiders were kept at bay.
And then there's this idea of "play it safe, there's always next week" that disappears last week.
I love to cook, but I can't imagine putting myself through this.
I am grateful to those who do and thus provide us with great entertainment and push us to try new things.
Let's go to the 2015 GBBO!
I agree, last year's challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to make them and they had to tinker with one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to sort out, I don't know how they could pick a winner.
With Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the base being a bit dry (although I agree with Hollywood that the green glaze on Richard's mill didn't feel like it, anyway Richard had already lost by then).
I have to admit that several of the challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time allotted.
There's also cancer lurking, with the sun's rays.
We're definitely doing well right now.
A bad time to be had by mankind, one hopes.
You're confusing solar wind with ultraviolet.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of particles of residual solar wind and UV.
So even if the magnetic field were to weaken, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to drive ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and cancer.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block the UV rays.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don't know about.
If we limit ourselves to humans, they have the benefit of enabling us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to keep us warm (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVC and lets UVA and most UVB through.
You know you don't have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor a moron when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor detail that was implied in the commentary, which itself is intended to be pedagogical.
Not to mention I'm a melanoma regular, and UV only accelerates its development.
They don't cause it.
To illustrate: not all tanned people have melanoma.
Or when a doctor tells you to avoid the sun and live in a cave, you'd better not listen, because UV light is necessary for every human being.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything else: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV rays directly cause melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And more importantly, can we put it in the blender?
Or put it in the blender...
I think the majority of those who are interested in this have established that anything can be folded if you apply enough force to it and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the purpose for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more durable and that's why it hasn't yet adopted the iPhone 6 as its first line of communication.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
Most people who have studied the subject have found that anything can be bent if you apply enough force to it.
Except for the Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We do that joke in every conversation.
I decided to count them.
That's the fourth folding joke I've read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before you install specific software, imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and you have no idea how it will ever get back.
So, what is the point of this?
Most likely it's a production unit that didn't install iOS correctly and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But, would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
I'm the perfectly stupid article.
We want cheap products and we wonder why industrialists produce in a industrial way We put the spotlight on supermarkets but all the shops and even the small businesses are concerned How to eat well, organic avac 1650€ (average salary in France)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After all, everyone is free to set his priorities where he wants.
For me, food is one of them.
Go without resentment, I kiss you
We call bobos, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological  software that leads them to disconnect from reality.
This is the total unbundling of thought-reason.
They're experts at gesticulating, pretending to save the planet because they didn't take a shower.
They are also experts in truffle, joining the left-caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning the CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens cannot stand this mixture of heavy ideology and truism, so don't be surprised if you often meet with criticism about them.
Wow, thank you for that thorough and exhaustive theorization and all the associated details (airplane, shower...).
I'd like to be part of it, but I can't find myself.
The concept is not that complicated.
The boboécolos are one-piece.
You understand the concept of the left-caviar?
Well, you're in a position to understand the concept of the boboécolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecologists in general.
The boboécolo is one of them, but it is only the most visible fringe of the eco-s because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, nobody wants to look that giraffe in the face.
It's so badly damaged that it vaguely resembles a female nude.
Shit, you're off the hook.
You have to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the astonishing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment since you have not spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin can't draw and always seems to be obsessed with the same subject.
The point is, she really did manage to become fabulously rich and famous with no artistic ability.
That's the art.
No, it's the pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
That's not really a proven fact.
It's more of an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy are realistic reproductions of dogs smoking while playing pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than just representing reality.
If that's all you're looking for, a camera will do.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still money to be saved: on horseback riding, the number of horses in the Republican Guard, the status of retired generals.
It is fair to say that France is reducing its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes more drastically, starting with Britain.
That's only half as encouraging...
Operational without backup, it's bound to get out of hand.
This is a unique approach, at a time when we are observing the weaknesses, the inadequacies of our defence apparatus, particularly in the Sahel.
This is a serious blow to the local authorities concerned, who are losing a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
@edmond: that's what I said, look elsewhere to save money but especially not at my place, at my place it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look elsewhere where the mistake is certain.
Let all those who have had any contact with the military dare to come here and say, eye to eye that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting into laughter...
If the same formula is applied to the whole of the civil service, public finances will be a little better.
And for Josie: really, really loud: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why Defence can feel a little overwhelmed!
The savings that everyone agrees that we should make, they have to be seen somewhere, right?
For lack of pot, those who fall on it moan at the assassination when it comes to their homes, the poor darlings.
I should do it, but I don't want it to fall on me, because then it's a crime, not an economy.
Go, you!
How does closing the Val de Grace weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, the same story repeats itself every time a post, maternity ward, hospital or barracks is closed.
But everyone is for the savings, of course.
It's strange, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and doesn't celebrate the savings in public spending.
This article is the most mind-boggling thing I've ever read!
That awkward moment when the first three people to comment all make the same bad joke.
It's the depression of scrolling through your Facebook feed and seeing that 80 percent of your friends started their status with the phrase "This embarrassing moment".
I think they're gonna make a movie out of it.
He's probably basing it on hilarious scenes where someone happens to run into their ex on the bus on their way to work and only then realizes that their skirt has gone back into their panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's totally stupid.
No, I think the author is playing the typical British man who's always been taught to suppress his emotions and grit his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after a 25 year absence was a big deal.
You realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle over who gets the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
Oh, my God, I have to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has truly demonstrated that he is at the very top of the cosmic universe of satirical journalism!
I'm going to fall backwards!
I absolutely must share this with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they can finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible brilliance and unsurpassed genius that flows from Mr. Brooker's keyboard like a divine glow.
God, that was really lame.
Especially if they're not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite. I'm not a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we are being stripped of the right to save our planet by states that play the tartuffs at every meeting to save the planet.
So we, the citizens, decided to take matters into our own hands.
With the energy commissioner they have planted, all those fine recommendations have flown away....
Wind turbines and solar farms are the Rond Points of tomorrow.
All financed by the taxpayer.
I beg you to stop this pro-nuclear talk.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
Until the whole chain is mastered, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided, of course, that we drastically reduce our consumption.
Electricity from renewable energy to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not involved.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions at the production stage and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity from renewable wind or PV is already more GHG than other steps and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittency.
Replacing nuclear with renewable wind or PV would go against the fight against CO2.
I am not insulting you. I am a Ph.D. in Physics, 1981 and I have also done research in nuclear physics. I challenge you to prove the contrary of what I have said.
Because what I didn't say is you who lend me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany nothing actually you didn't respond to what I said and like all people on the right demolish the interlocutor I never do it.
I would also like to quote the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German Government: the current German renewable energy programme is a non-cost-effective and ineffective way of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
The Commission's proposal is based on the principle that the energy from nuclear power stations is produced in the form of water vapour and a small part in river water.
I stopped reading when you mentioned Pakistan as a  giant of South Asia ...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
It doesn't surprise me, most of the Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, that's a good indication of your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India the giant of South Asia...
I have no objection to some Pakistani players participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply be opening a Pandora's box of corruption and mafia.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Athletico Kolkata winning 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan has a long, long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India spends on cricket, IPL and now football, how could we ever compete with our  noisy neighbours ...
The race to the low-cost pitcher is paid for in cash.
It's a shame for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design flaw only manifests itself with too cold helium.
So maybe we're not in a design flaw, but an implementation flaw...
Unlike Arianspace which is a private company, it seems that Soyuz is owned by the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay for the satellites in frigates. Who knows?
This is all the more troubling as many media outlets repeat the headlines of articles in a loop - and many readers only remember these headlines.
In total, this creates a false impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
I agree with you, the title is inappropriate, it unfairly calls into question the project when it is only a problem of the launcher.
