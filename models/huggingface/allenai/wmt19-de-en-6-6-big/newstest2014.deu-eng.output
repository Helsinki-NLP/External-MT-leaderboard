Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 meters apart: On Tuesday, the new B33 pedestrian traffic light at the village car park in Gutach was put into operation - within sight of the older city hall traffic light.
Two plants so close to each other: Intention or bullshit?
This question was answered clearly yesterday by the mayor of the expert report.
"The city hall light was installed at that time because it secures the way to school", Eckert explained yesterday.
The traffic light is safe for cyclists, bus passengers and mountain residents.
The plant, which was officially commissioned yesterday, is important for the intersection of Sulzbachweg and Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, the spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area › Grub ‹.
"In view of the high traffic and pedestrian volume, a further traffic light had to be installed to ensure their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements on the B 33, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day, about ten percent of which are heavy goods vehicles," Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of a further traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety comes first here," says Arnold.
Altogether four traffic shows were accomplished, also a roundabout was considered, however because of the narrowness in the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße again rejected.
According to Arnold, everything had been tested before when choosing the location of the traffic light poles: "By means of a transporter loaded with especially long logs, we tested whether these vehicles could leave the Sulzbachweg on the B 33 without buckling the traffic light poles."
The traffic light system itself, which costs around 15,000 Euros, is "the most modern system on the market", Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that glow so brightly that the lights can be easily seen by drivers, for example, even when the sun is low.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume around 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the street is free, there is an immediate green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be completed.
"If a group or handicapped people cross the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone comes safely over the road", Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver has to think about this as a partner and observe the road ahead.
This was not the case yesterday: As soon as the traffic lights for pedestrians showed green, an upper class car rushed through - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the hardships of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years.
The Carinthian poet has often described the catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the tendency to raw violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness.
The Büchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prose writer, theater texts are rare in his work.
For his performance "Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze" ("Weatherlights on the tip of the tongue"), which can now be seen in the Garage X at St. Peter's Square, collage of prose texts is therefore put together.
The theater maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prose miniatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa, on which one alludes to copulating and masturbating - the eight-member ensemble wobbles through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to trust the text little.
The 70-minute performance covers the original with a wealth of directorial ideas, known from the repertoire of postdramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses get involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic realizations.
They are touched hard, their heads are submerged, and their evening gowns are stapled to the wall.
Squeezed into cellophane or bodice, they stack on dangerously high sticks through the staging, either monologizing loudly or lying completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly conveyed in this strenuous way.
The evening has the best moments when people sing - the spectrum ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the exaggerated performance come to rest, and Winkler ’ s almost absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits into the dashboard of every car.
The devices that record every kilometer traveled and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system of financing U.S. American roads.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and are in favour of the government being able to use the small boxes to record the kilometres travelled - and possibly also where they have been driven - and then use the information to calculate tax returns.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system where drivers pay per mile driven over the next ten years.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS.
This is really a must for our country.
“It ’ s nothing we ’ ll use just possibly, ” said Hasan Ikhrata, general manager of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record the miles traveled by all Californian drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed by taxes, is failing to pay the US at the pump.
But there is not as much refueling in America as there used to be.
Cars use less fuel.
The government ’ s fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per litre) has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by a cent when fuel prices are high.
"The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most sensible alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
Not surprisingly, urban liberals support the idea, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behavior in a way that reduces congestion and climate-damaging emissions.
The Californian planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious, statutory goals of the state on climate change.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also said that he sees this as the most viable long-term alternative.
Also the free marketers of the Reason Foundation are taken by the idea to let drivers pay after covered distance.
"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole," says Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move toward mile-based billing.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance, reacting to concerns raised by rural MPs who represent people who often have to travel many miles to work or to the city.
Several states and cities are nevertheless moving in this direction on their own.
Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment, is the most committed.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering one.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently studying how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could follow any of their movements.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, Nevada's ACLU warned on their website: "It would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into full-fledged monitoring devices."
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on individuals ’ daily movements.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to track the kilometers traveled, but not exactly when and where.
This, Khan said, would also reassure the public.
The hunt for this technology has led some government agencies to create a small startup, True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not start to help states to tax drivers.
Rather, their goal was to establish themselves in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers should pay on the basis of the miles flown.
But the devices she tested are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information, which is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to get involved if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no equipment at all and instead pay a flat rate based on the average miles traveled by all state residents.
Other agencies hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that can also be used to pay parking fees, pay for insurance only for kilometers traveled, and collect real-time speed data from other vehicles to help drivers avoid traffic jams.
"Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the advantages offered by the system," says a city planning document.
Some traffic planners wonder, however, whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion.
At the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission, officials said that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-off charge or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrid cars or other low-gasoline vehicles, so that they too pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if one aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's Head of Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team plays well
The volunteer fire-brigade mastered its Herbsthauptprobe despite personnel lack with Bravour.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
Department Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the Feder estate in Burgberger Straße for his training.
A short circuit is said to have arisen during sawing there.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke, but one of them was still able to send an emergency call.
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two breathing apparatus bearers of the weir prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, the first person was found and escorted outside.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, as there was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stabling for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also bales of straw.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first fire attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
A further pipe was installed above ground hydrants at a distance of around 100 metres.
Now three fire attacks could be designed.
A hollow jet pipe was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer ’ s aim in the exercise was also to show what can be done with little available staff.
In case of an emergency, support is provided by the Königsfeld Day Group.
The Commandant was satisfied with the progress of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies is important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau in the Black Forest, the Speaker of the State Parliament, Guido Wolf, also visited Titisee in Neustadt to find out where the workers of tomorrow come from.
At the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald, he investigated this important question together with the heads of vocational schools, the Kreisgymnasium and the chairmen of the parents ’ advisory board.
"Education is an important location factor", underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the "Hans Thoma" school, which presented the networked school project "Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald".
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between Förderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and Berufsschulzentrum in Wälderstadt.
He also praised the family friendliness in the county.
"It is important not only to keep an eye on the family phase, but also on the care of relatives due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also pointed out that more and more employees were taking care of their relatives.
"Without the support of the employers, the resulting burden on the employees can lead to the termination of the employment relationship", said Wolf.
But no one can afford to lose a skilled workforce, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"After all, anyone who has already learned about the region's advantages during his or her studies often retains the regional economy with his or her acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the President of the Landtag said with conviction.
Because only if sufficiently training places were offered, also the skilled person need could be covered.
In his opinion, the advantage of the administrative district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
In addition, he experienced on his train journey from Titisee to Freiburg Neustadt the efforts already made for the expansion of public transport.
"Remain persistent and ensure that public transport is improved", he told the local politicians present.
Enjoy an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietingen seniors to coffee, cake and then a snack.
In the past, the elderly were catered for in the rest area.
In the meantime this afternoon takes place in the St. Josef nursing home.
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and pies.
Later there was salad.
Silvia Kimmich and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with common melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as a front demarcation of the old schoolyard standing before the reorganization to the Kirchstraße is to be set again also on the reorganization cost plan of the city Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig a small angular wall was inserted with the first work of the reorganization of the front schoolyard, for the stabilization and static discharge of the over one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The further procedure plans, so Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger town building office to include the national monument office in the planning and to provide a reorganization concept for the old wall.
Afterwards a cost calculation is to be made by specialists, which is to be put then to the local council for the decision and definition of the further procedure on the table.
A decision on this is expected to be taken next year.
After the restoration, paving and planting of the old schoolyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, as a follow-up measure in the foreseeable future, the boundary wall in need of renovation must be completely renovated and placed on a new substructure.
The historical, one-hundred-year-old boundary wall of the old schoolyard to the church street, is mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, in need of renovation and has an arc inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage, but the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which is done by the current fortification works.
Initially, the refurbishment of the school grounds was planned as early as 2008 / 2009, but high unscheduled expenditure resulted in a postponement.
An important word with the historical school wall reorganization, which was even already used for film recordings, will speak the national monument office.
Should specifications come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the preservation of monuments.
The pupils of the Bräunlingen primary school, who are now being taught again in a well renovated old school building with a new auditorium, will soon be able to use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Green Party, has now joined in the ongoing discussions about the future of music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up the holistic training at the Stuttgart Music Academy", Özdemir said to the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong together at the Stuttgart jazz location.
Özdemir, who is considered the favourite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, thus contradicts the Green and Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, it is pushing for a reorganisation of the five music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
Among other things, the Jazz and Pop study course is to be relocated from the Stuttgart Music Academy to the Mannheim Music Academy.
US-Border: "Super-Tunnel" zum Drogenschmuggel entdeckt
On the border between Mexico and the US, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super" tunnel for drug smuggling.
According to US Customs, the more than 500-meter-long pipe between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks, and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
According to the figures, the tunnel had not yet been opened.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can dig their way under the radar," said Laura Duffy, Attorney General of Southern California District, at a press conference outside a San Diego warehouse where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Addressing the drug gangs, Duffy assured them: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in a long-term fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug-related crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the extensive furnishing of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is located in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 metres down to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres high and 90 centimetres wide.
It would also have been appropriate to encourage illegal immigration into the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine discovery.
The third, a Mexican, was apprehended for the confiscated marijuana.
All three face life imprisonment as the maximum punishment, as officials have said.
According to the press conference in San Diego, eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006.
However, it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Cocaine is usually smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug investigation agency in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the US.
No details of the detainees were disclosed, at least one was Mexican, it was said.
They can expect prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisinger Festjahr
The jubilee of the town Geisingen on the occasion of 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year comes to an end in a good eight weeks, the anniversary year is imminent.
Geisingen and churches in Hausen were first mentioned together in a document in 794.
A document was made in churches in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there is to be an official prelude to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen has no hall at present, this prelude meeting in the place, where before 1250 years both were mentioned for the first time, takes place in churches.
In the context of the jubilee several events are planned both in Geisingen and in churches.
In July, on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July, churches in Hausen will celebrate the 1250.
Celebrating return.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a celebration around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this festive weekend, there is also the church "Hausener Kirchenfest".
On the occasion of the anniversary, City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city, which will be performed on three dates.
On the 21st of June together with the celebration of the Black Forest solstice, on the 12th of July in the arena with fireworks and on the 13th of December as the first concert of the town music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is the last weekend in September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of Geisinger ’ s city anniversary, a new chronicle will be published.
"It should not only be a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but also a printed work about today's Geisingen, which consists of Geisingen, churches, Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today ’ s violin singing also celebrates its birthday in 2014; today ’ s space was completed in 1974 with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also a year with many other anniversaries.
The folklore guild Strohglonki begins on February 8 with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the harmony Gutmadingen is 90 years and has the banquet on March 29 and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and is celebrating this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and is celebrating this at the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a deed of donation, which is owned by the St. Gallen monastery, in 764.
The certificate was made in churches (Hausen), which was then the court square.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Reason 2014 this 1250 Years to celebrate accordingly, in addition to the municipal reform 40 Years ago.
Council takes aim at track systems
Should the "Am Hirschen" level crossing be extensively rebuilt to increase road safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
Schiltach has to take EUR 220 000 into its hands.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal in the coming year.
In particular, the safety at level crossings is to be increased - there are regular nationwide collisions of trains with other vehicles.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they must contribute a third of the costs, the rest is shared by the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach ’ s urban architect Roland Grießhaber explained the specifics of the railway crossing “Am Hirschen ” to the local council.
There the city plans to build a bulge west of the railway tracks at the height of the tunnel mouth there.
Larger vehicles, such as those transporting long timber, could also be parked there on oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary retaining wall in such a way that the city could widen the adjacent street in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed controversially in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the necessity of road dissemination: Thomas Kipp summed up the critics' mood with his statement: "Do we have to take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The "Hirschen" level crossing is regularly used for transporting long timber.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" is partly transported on this route, because the up to 20 Meters long vehicles could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn into the main road.
Furthermore, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Since it could be foreseen that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and refurbished, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the "Am" Hirschen level crossing could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to have an investigation carried out into what the planned widening of the road would cost.
Regardless of this, the majority agreed to the reconstruction of the level crossing with the stipulation that the necessary retaining wall would be constructed in such a way that the city could expand the adjacent road in the direction of "Bahnhofstrasse" to around 5.5 metres, if necessary, for meeting traffic.
The reconstruction of the level crossing at the Trautwein Tannery, on the other hand, could lead to a completely different problem concerning the access road to the steeply rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had the plans for the reconstruction of the railway examined by the Breinlinger engineering office, as it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would still be possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it could not be ruled out that the gradient of the road could lead to longer vehicles being on the road.
The responsibility for this in turn lies with the city as a road load carrier.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the timber removal and the turning worked in the current state, the reconstruction of the level crossing should not be approved, Haas argued.
Furthermore, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the crossing at this point was significantly lower than at the other level crossings, because the middle station, to which there was a good line of sight, was located directly next to it.
Even trains from the central station should be braked at this point already so far that no collision threatens.
According to the councils, the majority of the people refused to agree to the reconstruction of this level crossing, as the town of Schiltach would have to "take the brunt" of the problem with vehicles on the ground, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the completion of the construction work.
The committee regards as unproblematic the conversions at the level crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which already crossing agreements with the railway were made.
Esa Decides on Large Space Missions: Missions for Billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes – experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the coming years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far Worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets near other stars.
Whether there are lives on at least some of them, nobody knows.
The choice is difficult: Should one look for gravitational-waves?
Or rather investigate the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and discover extraterrestrial life?
Those in charge of the European Space Agency, Esa, are asking themselves these questions.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make a decisive contribution to research.
The budget for such "L" missions is approximately one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were on the agenda, five of which have now been shortlisted.
Numerous bodies examine the proposals, check with the researchers.
A final decision by the Scientific Programme Committee is to be taken in the next few days.
Esa has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme initiated in 2007 are to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to investigate this question, the space telescope "Cheops" is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity will be examined in more detail.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, searching for "biomarkers": gases that are considered indicative of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is ultimately intended to shed light on the preconditions for the emergence of life.
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and its particle radiation with the planetary system play an important role.
In our solar system, these processes can be investigated by way of example.
With the "Solar Orbiter" Esa has already approved a mission of the M ’ class (where the budget is about half a billion Euros) for this question.
The spacecraft will launch in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the Sun closely.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this Esa provides the first of a total of three L ’ missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The spacecraft "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is scheduled to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter to study the planet ’ s atmosphere and the icy moons of Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to examine whether the natural laws known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations, which could show the physicists the way to a new theory, under whose roof all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
Our cosmos was created by the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago.
In addition to the matter we know, consisting of stars, planets and living beings like ourselves, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, through whose action the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", Esa has already approved an "M" mission, the start of which is scheduled for 2020.
Using a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
In the opinion of many experts, the best chances of obtaining a permit as a L ’ mission is "E ’ Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
Physicists understand this to mean changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
To this day they have not been proven.
Elisa could do that, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission envisages a detector consisting of two or three probes, which will be stationed in space.
In contrast to plants on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that originated at the Big Bang and thus provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals compete for the second mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which will explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which will detect and study Earth-like planets.
Among other things, proposals have already been submitted for the samples, return transport from Mars, research on the Moon, Venus and asteroids, and solar physics.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany regarding US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the US State Intelligence Service, has stated that he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
The German MP Hans the Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he has received asylum, to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which Ströbele presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, he wrote: "Even if the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissent as a breach of loyalty and tries to criminalize political expression with the threat of punishment, in which no defense is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
The German Minister of the Interior, Mr Peter Friedrich, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, then we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the US and Germany are strained by claims that the NSA tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said that the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible "without jeopardizing him and completely ruining relations with the US."
Ströbele, a member of the Green Party, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele said that according to the lawyer of the former NSA, Snowden could not return to Russia when he left the country.
When Snowden testified in Germany, he said he needed an assurance that he was "safe" there.
Snowden says in his letter that he was subjected to a "serious and ongoing" campaign of persecution that drove him from his homeland.
However, he was touched by the worldwide reaction to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians - including in the United States - have described revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a credit to the public.
In his letter, Snowden offered the German authorities an offer of cooperation "when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Frontier Airlines charges for cabin baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to US $100 to passengers who wish to stow hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to US $100 for one piece of hand baggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though Wednesday ’ s announcement said passengers would be allowed to keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, and small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if paid in advance, and $100 if paid at the gate.
Frontier ’ s spokeswoman Kate O ’ Malley said the fee of $100 is aimed at getting travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this amount," she said.
Airlines started charging for the first and second piece of checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into their hand baggage, with the result that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Charges are one way of getting passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee was not really about making money.
They are Frontier ’ s most loyal customers, who have clearly shown that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline ’ s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take one piece of baggage free of charge at the Frontier gate, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a similar piece of baggage.
O'Malley said the Frontier website and check in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they reached the gate.
Frontier ’ s new carry-on baggage fee will only come into effect in the summer; there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to use them.
They argue that transporting luggage would cost money, and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are making enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, have so far left the fingers of charges for hand baggage.
Three years ago, Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand baggage, and then Allegiant Air, another low-cost airline, followed.
The only other carrier with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline ’ s advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit hand baggage fee would raise $50 million annually.
Sorensen, formerly a leader at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what would await him at the gate if passengers were faced with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage charge.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest I have experienced in my aviation career," he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and tangible discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he explained, "and the boarding went smoothly."
Frontier also follows Spirit in the $2 they charge for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice could keep the whole can and refill coffee for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to charge for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed it seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline had joined.
Frontier ’ s move to charge for hand baggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to its own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to encourage passengers to buy directly from them, rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier has gone the furthest in this area, however.
In September, the company began awarding half the frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced once again to 25 percent of the flight distance.
A flight with Frontier booked with a third-party provider will therefore earn customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when purchasing directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and losing money.
Revenue fell by 9 percent and flight capacity contracted by just under 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to control Frontier's finances by selling the company.
Proverbs come from the Bible
A good 40 women visited the last women's breakfast of this year in the Protestant congregation in Bisingen.
Theme of the day in the parish hall were "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Phrases from the Middle Ages".
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, chairwoman of the parish council, gave a lecture on the biblical proverbs.
"Proverbs contain wisdoms, rules or warnings," she said.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding biblical passages and explained the meaning.
She called them proverbs, saying, Let the eye of the wood watch, as the scales fall from the eyes, and let him have an eye; but the Lord giveth him sleep, and shall wash his hands in innocence.
Several times the speaker also let her listeners guess which proverb it was.
The church council member Christel Dehner took on the sayings from the Middle Ages: All good things come in threes, make blue, cut something.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges to the past".
At the end a raffle was drawn.
The prizes were covered on a table and humorously described before they were handed over to the winners.
Mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger also mingled with the visitors of the breakfast round.
Learning instead of the unemployed: pilot project for unskilled in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is starting today at the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified over three winters as specialists for hotels and restaurants.
"What is new is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Employment Agency.
The benefits are manifold: the participants do not become unemployed, the companies get trained specialists, who are increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency does not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are also involved in the project.
NSA says an "internal mistake" and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a bug had paralyzed its public website for several hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight, because an internal error occurred during a planned update," the spy agency explained in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA ’ s website was unavailable for at least six hours, and some users still don ’ t.
Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the agency ’ s sensitive internal network was “in no way ” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, said the spokesman.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA ’ s website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to infiltrate the target system ’ s internal network.
The once-super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency, is now in the public eye and is facing severe criticism following revelations of its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad in recent months - a result of the secret NSA data stolen and released by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over intelligence fueled initial speculation that today ’ s incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of people without jobs dropped slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate of 3.1 percent is better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder "Bauer, deputy branch manager of the Agency for Employment in Sonthofen.
Because many enterprises reacted so far cautiously with employments.
One reason for this is, according to Felder, Bauer: "We have hardly any skilled workers in the crafts, in health care and in elderly care".
As a result of the seasons, vacancies for staff in the hotel and catering industry have been running again since September.
The winter season starts in mid-December.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäu bulletin of 31 October 2013 (page 33).
Drop in profits at Bombardier after decline in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday after it was under pressure from declining orders and aircraft deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in the rail business.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use next September, in line with the ambitious schedule.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago has so far been followed by only three further launches, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is proceeding as planned.
The results fell short of the forecasts and led to a fall in prices of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered his rating from "outperform" to "sector perform" in view of the fact that the stock has limited price potential over the next one or two quarters.
"Although weaker deliveries of aircraft were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft testing program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft line can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, to date binding orders for the 177 CSeries have been moderate as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests to see if the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 firm orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
The company management also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
"The test aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground testing and software updates had been scheduled during the aircraft's lifetime.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then a period of review, which we did.
This is done throughout the entire flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, the rest shortly thereafter, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts remain sceptical as to whether the first customer can put an aircraft of the CSeries into operation twelve months after the maiden flight.
Bombardier said it is reviewing the commissioning plan (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - although it appears to correspond to Bombardier's internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ending on September 30, Bombardier ’ s net income fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share from $172 million or 9 cents per share the year before.
The adjusted earnings per share remain unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world ’ s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order book in the Aerospace Division stood at $32.9 billion on September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our targets, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Turnover in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector have increased by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order book in the Transportation Division amounted to 32.6 billion dollars on September 30, a slight increase compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by handling problems with some major contracts.
According to management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trading on Thursday, Bombardier ’ s stock fell by 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that Google ’ s CFO Patrick Pichette will move to the board.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest rival to Bombardier, reported a 10% decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shooting at the airport of Los Angeles
An unknown person fired shots at LAX on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport authorities reported via Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
The media also reported that several people had been injured.
US President Barack Obama will be kept informed of the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses claimed to have seen a shooter with a rifle in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
One traveller told CNN that many people had sought shelter in panic.
Travelers would have screamed and cried children.
Among those waiting, panic had broken out, many had hidden behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, says a Los Angeles Times traveler.
An employee of the safety authority TSA suffered a gunshot injury on the foot.
The scene was "like in a film".
The man reported that he was then taken to a security area himself.
The shots are said to have been fired near a security area.
Airport berat-evacuated building
TV pictures showed how numerous ambulances and police cars drove in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken from the building to safety.
Users on Twitter posted photos of a special task force and a gun lying on the ground.
As reported by the airport management via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were closed, which according to CNN formed a long backlog.
With the exception of landings, air traffic has been suspended.
However, several planes were to be observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US carriers.
Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is the largest airport in the United States.
Kokainabhängiger lawyer, which warned drug boss before police investigation, must into the prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, shared information with underworld leader Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come to light
Sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known lawyer who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation for fear that his secret drug addiction might be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld leader Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into Scarborough ’ s drug-trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The "first-class" lawyer, nicknamed "Bash", was arrested at his home in 2011 after police oversaw Scarborough, whom he represented in an earlier drug trial.
Officials watched as Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine to the lawyer ’ s house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was having dinner with colleagues at the bar.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after traces of cocaine were found in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards during tests.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They were later arrested along with 32 others after police secured £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine, as well as £200,000 in cash, in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction might become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted of two counts of obstruction of justice by the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial.
He admitted possession of cocaine in a previous interrogation.
The lawyer was convicted after police found out in their investigation that Scarborough had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta ’ s house and put the drugs under the lawyer ’ s dustbin with a 60 percent purity in a black golf glove.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park for dinner.
The lawyer returned home to get the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court, it became known that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after Class A drugs were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards during tests.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, saying that he had talked to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and that their discussion was subject to "attorney secrecy."
During his arrest, Ditta took out his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a sample of his hair was taken.
During the police interrogation, he said that he ran an office both at home and at work, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It became known in court that he had called key drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented, for significant arrests and informed investigators of what they knew.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone that you don't break the law."
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a defence lawyer because he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker, but that of a drug trafficker who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the advocate of these people.
But this went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing, claiming, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but do so immediately."
However, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police Department said, "Mr. Ditta took the step from being a trial lawyer to being a criminal the moment he started to acquire drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who instructed him to gather valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public confidence and confidence.
Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
Lancashire ’ s Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation of Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases of possession of cocaine and impediment to justice, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to the conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years' imprisonment for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published a section with questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, that his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and that inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of sacred music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which delighted the audience in the spring of this year, the Liederkranz will enrich two services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary mass will be heard from 19 during the evening mass in the St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 at the divine service in the St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Gesänge zur Feier des heiliges Opfers der Messe", D 872, is a sacred musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The mass is performed within the framework of the divine services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider the choir is accompanied by the brass section of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism increasingly gives way to confidence
With the elections for the parish council in 2015, for example, fundamental changes will take place in the pastoral unit in Haslach (SE).
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
For nothing can be changed to the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement these as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new gives way hesitantly but visibly to confidence.
From the ideas and expectations for the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six committees with the main officials of the pastoral team were enough.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained in a presentation the new guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
The SE Haslach as a parish will in future form a body under public law, which will enter into the rights and duties of the six individual parishes.
There will only be one common parish council and one foundation council, in which the pastor Kraft Amt is represented.
From each parish at least two elected members should be represented, in the six parishes so-called parish teams are formed locally.
Their task will henceforth be to promote the life of the local Church.
With the question about the finances of the individual parish then substantial discussion need showed up.
The innovations provide that accumulated funds in the parishes remain earmarked.
In contrast, the liabilities are transferred to the entire congregation.
Precisely with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then affects all parishes, there was great concern.
“Also in the past only in projects one invested, which could be mastered by the individual parishes alone ”, relativized Haslachs parish local council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, Chairwoman of the committee in the Schutterwald pastoral unit in Neuried.
In 2006, they set themselves the task of "becoming one, staying five" and realised that this was not so easy.
The committees of the Haslach pastoral unit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the parish teams.
The elaborations will be substantiated in further meetings and decided in a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
At the end, Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity is becoming more expensive
Pfullendorf ’ s citizens must adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the public utilities, Jörg, Arne Bias, confirmed to the SOUTH COURIER, 70 to 90 euro additional costs per year come to a four-headed Pfullendorf family.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is fixed each year in October by the four operators of the major power lines.
These quantify the additional costs arising for them from the energy transition, which they can levy on the electricity price.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf are the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the supervisory board of the energy company even assumed a higher levy, as Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated, before the public utilities could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
“We assume an increase of 1 cent plus x ”, so Bias, whereby the number will rather lie in the proximity of the 2 cent.
Traffic light on permanent red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What is to be done then - to drive with red?
If someone has waited long enough at a red light and the intersection is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time had to be "appropriate", which could be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker recommends staying for at least five minutes before a traffic light malfunction can be assumed.
Those who continue the journey in spite of the red light, however, must be aware that they are entirely to blame for an accident caused by it.
Who tolerates itself less than five minutes, does not wait under circumstances long enough, warns Becker and refers to an order of the higher regional court Hamm.
In the case under discussion, a driver ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent violation of red light.
The traffic light was not defective, but switched to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
Municipal Council welcomes sound budget
Mayor Ralph Gerster always has a good laugh when it comes to the budget in council meetings.
The municipal bag in Herdwangen is well filled and the administration has not known any debts since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be considered a complete success in this sense.
This became clear with the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget, at around EUR 7.6 million, was more than EUR 1 million higher than planned.
Also the surplus of the administrative budget was with approximately 1.8 million euro approximately one million euro over the beginning.
The surplus is owed above all to higher trade tax receipts and the municipality portion of the income tax.
The wealth budget was also well above the planned levels.
Last year it was EUR 2.5 million instead of EUR 1.5 million.
"This is mainly due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget", said Rothmund.
As fewer investments were made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the injection of reserves was also higher.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and their team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like that out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and local councils obviously rejoiced at the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens dear.
Due to the good financial situation the municipality could do without high lifting rates in the past.
According to Gerster, this in turn has meant that subsidies from the country have often been cut.
The conditions are in place for these subsidies from various compensation canes.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for subsidies must have certain lifting rates.
"We have to look at the issue of hoisting, as there will be investments in the coming years for which we would like subsidies," Gerster announced.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter since 60 years in choir
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Wermters' story with the male choir Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival, during which he was honoured.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his men's choir.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir, which has become more than popular in the meantime.
Wermter was also active in the association, among other things as a member of the committee for 28 years.
He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association: Jörg Kohr, pastoral officer on behalf of the Rottenburg Association of Cecilia in Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - with a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singing colleagues presented him with the certificate of the German choral association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the award, the 31st Autumn Festival took place in the usual way: with the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singers ’ department Baisingen and the local Musikverein, the Vollmaringer had invited a colourful mixture of different choirs and vocal styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
They prepared a little serenade for their honorary singer Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's choir Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "Wann du durchgehst durchs Tal".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "Impulschor" - ensured the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir abducted to foreign countries with the Neapolitan folk music "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus, while the "impulse choir" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
With "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", the singers department of the Baisinger Sportverein returned to their homeland, where the Musikverein in Vollmaringen offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Grandma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Punch and Judy show and read a few stories, which kept the children busy for lunch.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and day care centers in Zollernalbkreis are getting mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote would like to support the institutions in the realisation of their building and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day nurseries and crèches from the entire Zollernalbkreis can participate in the campaign.
If you have a building or beautification wish for your furnishing, you can apply with this to the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb will select three wishes from all entries.
What are the requirements for participation?
The wish should be realized with building material in the value of maximally 2000 euro and on one (action) day.
Beyond that the winner must provide even for many industrious building aids.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and one may ask oneself: what prevents the parliament from simply abolishing the judicial independence tomorrow?" was to be read in the newspaper, which considers the bill to be unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punishing and we reject it, ” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya ’ s most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is an extension of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President listens to us and we call on him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government is effectively "strangling the media" through the new law, while The Standard writes that "democracy and freedom of speech have been dealt a severe blow" in Kenya, calling the bill "draconian."
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
Kenya ’ s media incited the authorities ’ anger by publishing footage of security cameras allegedly robbing the luxury mall by units sent to the scene.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the subpoena was withdrawn after a media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single punishment can bankrupt most radio stations."
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's "lively blogosphere", according to its description.
If they silenced the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know, ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, the nation ’ s journalist, who calls the Kenyan media a key control factor in public life.
"Leaving politicians to themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and take us back to the time of hunters and gatherers," he commented.
Kenyan legislators have already incurred public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and reinstated their hefty salaries of around 532,000 shillings a month - one of the highest in the world.
Bad ’ Dürrheim: A dream comes true for the FC
Despite the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf pitch did not lose any of its importance for the city and the football club.
Everyone had probably wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Petrus did not want to play along.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold such for some reason had the disadvantage.
This went to the musicians who framed the ceremony, as well as to many speakers.
Therefore also the FC "president" Albrecht Schlenker became wet, who spoke of the fulfilment of a dream.
He expressed his gratitude to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly involved in the implementation of the project, to the municipal council, the participating companies and members of the association, who contributed.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The sprightly pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable honorary commitment appreciated also the state parliament delegate Karl Rombach.
Further welcoming speeches were made on behalf of the municipal sports committee, Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation to the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn affected the original lawn pitch in such a way that it could not be used.
Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations for the solution of the problem, when thought was given to the construction of a third place at the area of the football club or at the secondary school at the Salinensee.
Both were discarded again.
Six years ago, the idea of creating an artificial turf pitch arose, which was widely regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning was started two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, promised a contribution of 100,000 euros for the construction of the site and the state approved funding of 104,000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 366,000 euros of the total costs of 560,000 euros, Klumpp summarized.
Construction of the 68 by 108 metre artificial turf pitch began on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic meters of soil were removed, half of which was used to create a dirt track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on justice and home affairs.
The responsible working group met in the morning in Berlin.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, bribery and the Federal Police.
The Migration and Integration Working Group also wanted to continue its discussions in the morning.
This is likely to include the issue of dual citizenship, where both sides have opposing ideas.
The SPD wants to put an end to the compulsion for German-born immigrant children to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
With the topic traffic, which does not stand on this Friday on the conference rules, the SPD underpinned its no to a by the CSU demanded car for toll.
A Vignette is a “Flatrate for much driving and thus ecologically counterproductive ”, explained the SPD to negotiator for the topic traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his parliamentary group.
Evasive traffic on country roads threatened, which were already now accident focal points.
Furthermore, from Pronold ’ s point of view, the introduction of tolls for all passenger cars would only be a first step.
"There is a danger that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.

Vienna International Airport abolishes passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to gate 24
There will no longer be announcements like these at Vienna International Airport.
A large part of the loudspeaker announcements is thereby omitted - the noise level is to be lowered so clearly.
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere.
As Airport ’ s spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, Flughafen Wien is following an international trend with announcements that affect individuals.
Thus already among other things the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai do without the noisy appeals.
By the omission of these announcements - in an average one day approximately 200 personal calls by the loudspeakers sound - it is to be in the future calmer at the airport.
"Experience has also shown that these individual announcements were perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information on changed flight paths or departure times go down a little here," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.

Overview of Milk and Egg
Vegan nutrition requires vegetable alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
For example, mashed tofu with vegetable cream is a curd substitute.
The vegetarian federation calls further to the world vegan day on 1 November.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on 1 November, the German Vegetarian Association (Vegetarierbund Deutschland) proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, yoghurt can be replaced by soy yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Whipped plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also herbal alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Even 50 grams of applesauce or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable.
Loose dough instead of using egg for example with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking soda, a tablespoon of cornstarch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to data of the Vebu at present in Germany approximately 800,000 humans live vegan, thus purely vegetable.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Schwarzwald Gymnasium got to know the American city of New York.
After an eight-hour flight, we headed straight for the Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which constitutes a special charm in the evening light.
Due to the time difference, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but according to the motto "The city does not sleep", the day ended in Times Square.
Despite shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it went through the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of September 11.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating city from the 373 meter high observation deck of the Empire ’ s State Building and enjoy the view.
Afterwards we went through the hustle and bustle of the streets of New York via the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience everyday life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year a Hubertus mass is celebrated in the parish church St. Marien at the Hülsbergstraße on the name day of the holy Hubertus.
According to legend, St. Hubertus was a rather ruthless hunter, converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Liège.
The Jagdhornbläsergruppe der Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on parforce-horns (natural horns in the tuning Es) to old, originally French melodies.
The horsemen wear riding clothes, because they accompany primarily riders, horses and pack of dogs on drag-hunts musically.
The solemn mass will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new café.
One that invites you to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name the program.
According to the dictionary, déjà vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight of the Rhine Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to be the pure déjà vu.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that as its goal: to make an actual stay not only mentally, but tangibly recurring.
Because it's fun and just beautiful.
A look into the inner workings of Opschlag 8 immediately gives the viewer a good feeling.
The ultra-modern, but not cool café “Ambiente ” looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with various coffee or cocktail variations.
There are also delicious cakes or individually filled fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the pretty café at Opschlag: in Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve an den Opschlag, the sympathetic café lovers hope for more audience.
Not least by the university.
"Although we do not have a specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two want to address young students as well as seniors and all ages in between.
Talking about café ’ s lovers.
The sympathetic owner couple is behind the coffee.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in all its variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso ’ s fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino ’ s drinker.
"With a baguette - that's my thing", she reveals to the NRZ.
There were already two events in the bright café.
Better, one thing.
Because the harbour festival took place rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not profit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatzabend.
"Beautiful, successful and funny", the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner is not a true fan of event evenings: "You can't make it right for everyone".
And with an event I only address those who are also interested in the special event.
Therefore events will be the exception for us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible".
That is to say: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which develops more and more into a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many Klever, of the guests from near and far and of the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had gladly come.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker everyone enjoyed the harmonious togetherness under the sign of music.
Traditionally the donation celebration is also always the suitable Festivität, in order to make honors.
Secretary Rolf Wagener was happy about the special award "Singer of the Year".
"You have not only written down a great deal for us, but have also made quite a few rounds for us, for which we would like to express our sincere thanks," said the chairman of the choir, Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for the participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity bouquet went this year to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier, Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Place five occupied note warden Artur Brückner.
A special thank you was given by the board to the team of club manager Ange Pier, Ribbert, who once again conjured up a top-class menu, and to Gerda Pier, Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Frederick Wilhelm" meets for its regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 19.45 in the club room.
"New singing voices are always welcome", says Schlotmann.
UN Announces New Poverty Reduction Goals
The United Nations is now starting work on a new set of objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) on poverty reduction announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro that evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals, which are intended to replace the Millennium Goals, which expire in 2015.
They have been included in the final draft of the document that will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to "think beyond national interests".
"I am pleased that member states have agreed to start a process to agree on universal sustainable development goals," he said.
"These targets will build on our progress under the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 framework for development.
I will spare no effort in implementing the mandate given to me by the member states to realise our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, building on the success of the Millennium Development Goals. "
Even if the SG Achim / Baden is without victory for four days, there is still a good atmosphere in handball.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that.
Everyone continues to be fully motivated.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes", Malmon expects a feeling of success from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third league is currently reserve from Fredenbeck has not pulled out any trees, Malmon raises in advance warning the index finger.
Many players I have trained in the A still in the youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be especially motivated against their former coach.
“Besides it applies to wait whether then still reinforcement from the first is thereby ”, clarifies the SG.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon Team must definitely improve compared to the previous appearances.
Above all in the coverage work and in the switching game, there was a huge lack in the end.
The exploitation of opportunities must definitely be improved.
Therefore I hope that my players got their heads clear during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the country and first president of Mozambique, to make peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability", said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
Fearing for the country ’ s future, she exchanged her business clothes for a T ’ shirt with the slogan “We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the worst since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts think it unlikely that the country will return to full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy, because discovering huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring more than US $50 billion in investments over the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy, and Anadarko of the US.
The ruling Frelimo ’ s party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
Attacks on the former rebels escalated as government forces attacked Renamo ’ s bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group ’ s leader, according to Renamo ’ s spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself a "loser" who "wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he had meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and to do so seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have here two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are banging their heads together," says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at Open University and Mozambique.
None of them is good at negotiating and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reform, has already said that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo ’ s electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo ’ s member, is likely to improve in the election.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
“He doesn ’ t want multi-party democracy, he doesn ’ t want transparent elections, he doesn ’ t want peace because he doesn ’ t want to give up the presidency, ” Mazanga said.
It is not clear what capacity Renamo has, but it has made troublesome attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important northwest connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port used by mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga reluctantly answered the question of whether Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
The instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people are already worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultan, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again," he explained.
According to an author, children should be taught myths and legends as "role models for life".
Thor's stories showed that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks," and Arthur's legend demonstrated how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, were "far too wild, obnoxious, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools," which is why Crossley in Holland called for a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that with authors and teachers who are "overly didactic", children would "switch off completely", because in entertaining stories the messages are "subliminally" conveyed.
"You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background if possible," said Crossley, Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales.
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children lies in the need to communicate hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an intrinsic sense of good and evil.
This must be presented subliminally, revealed by history and not explained.
That is the old story of showing rather than telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof again
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years came to life in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely entertaining scene play.
From his arrival and the award of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had created an entertaining play that received a lot of applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time leaps from youth to approaching retirement.
On 22 October 1913, Hansjakob returns home to his children ’ s heaven, his courtyard.
And then the scene play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his parade role as the great son of the city.
In proper style he drove up with the two-seater and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" of Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received with much applause by the audience, but also welcomed by his sister Philippine.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood incredibly well to put himself into the role of the sister and gave her enormous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played suitably selected pieces of music and thus rounded off the performance.
To the award of the honorary citizenship then Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honor, which made in agency of the then incumbent Hättich together with a part of the city council his attendance.
Afterwards, the Epiphany singers paid their respects, which prompted Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh, how beautiful, my childhood memories of my own Epiphany will come to life again."
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the courtyard as well as the stork day children with their loud "Out, Out".
At that time Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church just as much as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the homeland earth, behind his grave chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene play.
There was much applause and many words of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: Hope of Neckar Giants Grows
The chances on the league stay of the Ludwigsburg Bundesliga have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard, then there is now one less competitor for the Neckar giants.
The basketball team Hamburg Towers does without an application for a possible place.
"We will not participate in the wildcard", said former international Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
A first breath of relief was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg nevertheless.
"We did not deal with the wildcard method, as long as it is not certain that Düsseldorf will not receive a license," said Neckar giant Alexander Reil, our newspaper's boss.
Until May 23, Aufsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets can submit documents to the arbitration court and prove his economic Bundesliga fitness.
Until now, the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last resort.
Haigerloch: Church of the Lord ’ s Supper moves into focus
As the city's contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Protestant Church in Haigerloch, the City of Haigerloch's Culture and Tourism Office is dedicating the last of this year's public theme tours to the Church of the Lord's Supper on Sunday, 27 October.
After visiting the atomic cellar, the Haigerloch period after 1850 should be considered, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning finale is a visit to the Church of the Lord ’ s Supper.
There the participants get told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant congregation in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also features the Last Supper painting by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is a faithful reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the one-and-a-half hour guided tour is at 3pm at the atomic cellar.
Tickets are available at the box office of the Atomkellermuseum.
For questions and information the tourist office of the city Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US spying affair in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor General ’ s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax agency, citing unspecified circles familiar with the situation.
Such an issue could be resolved intergovernmentally, it was said.
It is practically impossible for Snowden to leave Russia.
"In this case he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted her source.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatens extradition there, it was said further
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams competed for the title at the tennis tournament of the clubs.
In the end the endurance of the team Maier / Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of Sportfreunde Rohrdorf to the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team, each playing against the other.
It was played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament entered the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner were tied on points with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to bring the decision.
At the prizegiving ceremony, Carmen Müller finally handed over the challenge cup to Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the home stretch.
Second place went to double Michael Klippel / Sadmin Osmicic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team reached the bronze podium.
With late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful conclusion of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend in August, the Black Forest Open Air Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in the hands of children.

A varied holiday programme awaits visitors to the open-air museum until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is considered to be a lovable codger because he has decided to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt cannot be dissuaded from his dream despite a heart defect.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he moves by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Shrill beeping disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the dumps.
The company has several irons in the fire at the same time.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard also relies on wind turbines and logistics.
Black shimmers the coal on the storage place in front of the dike.
Two huge blue heap shakers and dischargers distribute or load the coal here as required.
With each movement of the cargo handling equipment a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
"The signals serve safety and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
With unfavorable wind this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now in the process of keeping the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to rely on open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the extension of the Niedersachsenbrücke Rhenus Midgard continues to focus on coal imports for power plants and is one of the big players in this sector in Europe.
Thanks to the reclining basin in front of the terminal, which is recessed to 18.5 meters, Capesize ’ s bulk carriers can also be handled here.
"This year, we want to crack the 3 Million tonnes mark during cargo handling," said Schrell.
In addition to the Eon ’ s power plant on site, the imported coal goes to power plants inland.
If the GDF ’ s Suez power plant is connected to the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imported per year would be realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bavaria's basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism with the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can prevent us from believing that we will win against the best team in Europe in the last two years," said coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83: 88 (39: 47) on Thursday evening at the defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At their only third appearance in the European premier class, the guys from Munich sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests managed to turn a 15 points deficit 13 minutes before the end into a lead, before Piraeus turned the game around again.
"We fought back unbelievably against the two-time Euroleague-champion, but then again made careless mistakes", said Bayern Team pro Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of the Munich team, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, the vaudeville artist Frank Fay, who worked as a confidant at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the crowd in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay ’ s innovation has expanded, most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the booth at Carolines institution, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and became more and more successful until they were too well-known to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
This year's event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy charity event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring performances by Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby, among others.
The world of comedy has grown with the festival.
A number of the comedians participating in this year ’ s festival have become known through more unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable TV (the ironically slippery Fantasy ’ s Football ’ s series “The League ” on FXX) and now has his own Sketch ’ s show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic W. Kaumau Bell, who focuses on racial issues) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has become a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the heart of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he is here, he sometimes walks through the alley between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here.
Iran satisfied with process of nuclear negotiations
One week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany, Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process.
“After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years, ” wrote Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way, but the nuclear negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides would reach a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Killing boys with machete
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14- and 12-year-old boys had invited their victim to go hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
They then played football in front of their apartments in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger one, who had taken her with her, was said to have been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl told the police about the killing without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
The reason given by the elder was, among other things, a rivalry in football.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth institution.
Pimp must go to prison
For exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threat, insult and dangerous bodily harm, the Regional Court of Constance sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years imprisonment.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a bouncer after two deployments in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a litigation agreement.
According to this, in five cases he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, whom he sent on the line against their will after a few weeks.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women, some of whom worked for him for years.
By confiscating cell phones and SIM cards, he cut off women ’ s contacts to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who arranged for the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partially monitored in order to control their income.
In court, the accused initially claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died next to him in an explosion.
The 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession after a psychiatric expert indicated grave doubts about mental restriction and thus about a reduced capacity for guilt.
The court did not hear any more of the injured women.
As reported by a police officer, after a first report by telephone monitoring measures at least four other cases of exploitative human trafficking could be investigated.
The intercepted conversations were characterized by a high degree of aggression.
In later interrogations the injured confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in whom one of the women had discovered bruises all over her body, has made no statement to this day.
It is "a completely broken personality", who regards violence and exploitation as normal in this profession.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
"He has broken away from these circles and wants to lead a normal life after his imprisonment," he said.
Oil price continues to fall to up to 96 USD per barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference oil grade for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel late in the morning in e-commerce in Europe on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a fall in prices of 5.8 percent in October.
The large crude oil supply has burdened prices in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the US bid increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had risen by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was evidence of stronger demand from two reports of activity growth in Chinese manufacturing.
This suggests that China ’ s economy continues to recover, growing at 7.8% in the third quarter, after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil of the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell by 26 cents on the ICE Exchange in London to $108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision to stop and re-Frisk ’ s directive of the NYPD
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked a judge ’ s order requesting changes to the New York Police Department ’ s “Stop and Search ” program, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Court of Appeal said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended until the city's appeal was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city was in violation of the Constitution with the way the program for stopping and interrogating people was being implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the corrective measures taken, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its policy and training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The appellate report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for US judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court ’ s criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil liberties of tens of thousands of people by inappropriately targeting black and Latin American men with the Stop and Justice Frisk program.
It appointed an external body to oversee the implementation of significant changes, including policy reforms, training and service oversight, and ordered a pilot programme of body-worn cameras in districts where most checks were carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were released after police control.
A hearing on the appeal of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-stop Frisk tactics have been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind have existed in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the term of the non-partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men belonging to all minorities filed a lawsuit, which became a class action.
Advocates of changes to the NYPD ’ s Stop and Frisk ’ s Program say the changes will end unfair practices, create a more trustworthy and effective police force, and affect the way other police presidents use the scheme.
Opponents believe that the changes will dampen police morale, not criminality; that money will be wasted; and that the broader problem of a police force under pressure following the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade will not be solved.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop and finish Frisk ’ s practice, which was constitutional, but only reformed the way the NYPD implemented the controls.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that succeeds in reaching only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already show considerable successes.
The first chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association.
He himself visited Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Cheijk ’ Zajed ’ hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynaecologist Henne performed numerous surgeries on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the interventions were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get an idea of the aforementioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the club was also shown.
It is a former federal border patrol vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning, according to Henne, to work with the association in an advisory capacity.
In 2008, the carpentry company Schleeh from Baiersbronn set up the infirmary in Socogim, a slum on the outskirts of the capital - on a voluntary basis - in a record time of just under a week.
Hen also mentioned a new mother, child, hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times in which the maternity clinic in Nagold is to be rationalized away.
One learns a lot in Africa as a physician, so Henne, for example deceleration against Burn.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to undertake as many journeys as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to visit various areas.
Containers of material are also regularly sent to Africa, for example in March this year medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans ’ s Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour by telling people from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into mobile goat barns and describing the experiences of the musicians from Stammheim, who traditionally support the association, on their trip to Mauritania.
As his personal motivation, he cited his work in the audit field as a young Member of Parliament.
When it became clear to him how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help the Africans to control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that global economy also requires global philanthropy.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than many people think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson Used Phone Hacking for Checking a Tips
Former News of the Word editor-in-chief Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false recommendation about a case by then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey Court that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby ’ s voicemails and prosecuted them, but Coulson also called them and left news, as the court learned.
"According to the prosecution, Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not one who stands in front of people's homes hoping to catch them in the act, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis explained.
He said NotW used three methods to investigate stories investigatively: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, of surveillance, otherwise it can not be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about telephone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumors of Clarke ’ s affair were first picked up by the NotW feature editors when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, “Don ’ t waste your time, she ’ s with Charles. ”
A tape of voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was seized in Mulcaire ’ s apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
During the research, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story to bring out tomorrow that I would like to talk about with Charles."
Edis said Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other key figures, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Blunkett over an affair with a married woman when he himself was in liaison with co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks dispute having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck, and Weatherup have admitted telephone hacking.
In protest against the planned tax on the rich, French football will indeed go through its first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting comes to an inconclusive end.
In the conflict over the wealth tax, the government and the professional football team have manoeuvred themselves into a blind alley after a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received club and association representatives and listened to their complaints on Thursday at the Élysée in Paris.
However, he refused to spare the football from the 75% levy on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years starting in 2014.
The opposite side also remained tough.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be continued, the head of the association of professional clubs (UCPF), Jean Pierre Louvel, announced.
The match days scheduled for Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between 29 November and 2 December are therefore cancelled.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning", Mayor Jens Häussler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants came to the congregation hall to get an explanation of the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to contribute ideas.
Häußler clarified: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
The flood that hit Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009 was a drastic event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, according to Häußler.
A river basin investigation was commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many cultivated properties as possible is the goal", so Häussler.
The planning is based on the protection against a statistically expected flood every 100 years according to the German weather service.
Climate change is accounted for by a 15% supplement.
In expert circles this is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had led to considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement", says Häußler.
In order to achieve HQ 100aKlima protection, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality expecting subsidies of around 70 percent from the state.
Mr äußler pointed out, however, that support only existed if an overall approach was implemented.
For it the municipality is dependent on the co-operation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval process had to be completed.
In the best case scenario, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was presented to the municipal council last week (we reported), provides for local measures in the inflow of the Irm river from the Stammheimer valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why more dams and reservoirs were not planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering firm Wald und Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasised that it required the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal.
According to Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe, it is also imperative to find the most economical solution.
Anliegern of the old place, which suffer even with normal thunderstorm rain again and again from an overload of the sewer network, was displeased.
The problem is well known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
Mr äußler pointed out, however, that the directives for sewer systems were different from those for flood protection and that this should not be mixed up.
The municipality is obliged to design the sewer network in such a way that two to three years of rainfall can be withstood.
Making the sewers bigger would devour millions.
Severe injuries after collision
On early Friday afternoon two car drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on the Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but at first could not say much about the course of the accident.
However, there were various testimonies, which should first be evaluated.
What is certain is that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to meet her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, and the woman was so badly jammed that the fire brigade needed just under half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident remained unexplained at first.
Both of them were taken to nearby hospitals.
The track was closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostoyevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a god-seeker, a metaphysician, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Astonishing relatives in appearance: stinging eyes, a beard, a high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the inventor and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is to be read as an American prophet, who certainly holds something in his own country.
A few titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, which distributes Haffman ’ s "Cassette mit den 118 Erzählungen Zweitausendeins".
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress, coupled with paranoia, security obsession, and a belief in being chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books reading like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer ’ s manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He realized, early on, that the computers are divinity.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
This is the Blade Runner problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minorities Report" dates from 1956, it exudes the odor of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals.
Here, the principle of "prevention of crime" is developed, "prevention of crime", that is, what is now more or less the official White House doctrine.
In Dick ’ s world, which is scary like ours, mutants look to the future – and the police intervene.
"We are tracking individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the agency.
"We grab them before they can commit a violent crime".
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, but we have a penal camp full of pesudo criminals".
They assume that something bad is happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick ’ s story seems like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the NSA ’ s bugging frenzy.
Anticipating the attack: Obama ’ s drones, the philosophy and practice, work like this.
But Dick's story is not over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no longer any separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then is the supervisor himself supervised and convicted of a future crime.
The system goes wild.
It is perfect, but it lies.
It invents its own premises.
Not only accept errors and sacrifices, but build on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means, again and again, coming closer to the truth.
Spying on Merkel in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US spying scandal surrounding German Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor ’ s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, Interfax reported.
Prior to that, the Green Party member of the Bundestag, Hans “Christian Ströbele, was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday in order to discuss the affair with him.
NSA ’ s revelations heighten corporate paranoia over government surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the Fight against Terrorism (BAT), the German Interior Intelligence Service, he was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to the German media, BAT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of views between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, again insisted in September that the US did not use foreign espionage "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the one-time whistleblower, began publishing his cornucopia of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and procured data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company ’ s paranoia to a new peak because of state surveillance.
The straw that broke the camel ’ s back was the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone had been bugged, perhaps for a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then surely corporate governance is also a potential goal.
Snowden has made the intense collaboration between US intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up ”, explains olive green, president of the BITMi, which represents small and middle IT enterprises in Germany.
German companies believe that the US is now almost as risky as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consultants EY.
In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there has been no evidence to date that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own firms.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Businesses are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"That's not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If we had wanted a strong European IT industry, we should not have allowed it to die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Yet the reach and technical sophistication of the US intelligence agencies revealed by the Snowden revelations have shocked firms that had previously seen the biggest spy risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to US jurisdiction and therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, some ten percent of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider after revelations of US data “mining ” activities with Prism.
Jim Snabe, deputy managing director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that didn't exist a year ago - where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction?"
Many German business leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and that they must be guarded at all costs.
It is no surprise that industrial espionage is taking place.
This has always been the case.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally in the current discussion, ” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate management usually does not boast about the countermeasures it has taken, because that gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have been told for a long time that it is not advisable to take a free USB stick with you at a trade fair or leave a laptop unattended in your hotel room, to put it mildly.
Ulrich Hackenberk, Member of the Board of Management at car manufacturer Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices.
The German BAT advises executives to use simple prepaid mobile phones when they travel abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid mobile phones are discarded afterwards.
There is, however, concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorised access," warns the BAT in a report.
The US is warning its own companies against industrial espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in February, the US National Intelligence Estimate ranked France, Russia, and Israel second behind China in terms of the countries that used hacking to obtain economic data.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it came to industrial espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French secret service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The secret services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terror, spy on their allies."
Hechingen: Messe gives answers to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can undertake," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, how at least the wedding celebration succeeds, were given now a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Important vendors around a wedding were represented.
A trend: The retro look has returned.
This starts with the wedding dresses.
White is a must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the clothes, which are often ruffled and embroidered, are closed, often with a veil, at the back, however, they go down the back and often end in a train.
But there are different opinions, as Stefanie Koch from the fashion house Kleidermüller emphasizes.
For men, the suit with waistcoat and plastron dominates, but cream-coloured or brown combinations can also be chosen.
Important is the choice of the restaurant, it was explained.
The room was a bit noisy at night.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the carriage house.
For those who want to drive up with the coach, Uwe Link has an offer.
"Horse-drawn carriages are also popular for social gatherings," he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and wedding pictures.
More and more fashionable is the "After ’ Wedding ’ photo" - that is, series of photographs at special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many other details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, like Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable feast.
Hundefreunde erfolgreich
Once again, the athletes of Hundefreunde Bitz were successful on a rally, Obedience, Tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the Beginner class and secured the fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he reached the twelfth place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp faced the critical eyes of the judge with her woody in class 1.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled up wrestling mat in the gymnasium of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was found on 11 January in an upright mat standing behind the grandstand in the school gymnasium.
The Sheriff of Lowndes County ’ s investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old ’ s family doubts this.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, attorney for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They had never believed that he had died as the Sheriff had concluded.
"They are of the opinion that there is no logic to violate the laws of physics as well as common sense," says Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in a body bag," he comments.
US Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation", he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of "positional asphyxiation."
A second autopsy, however, revealed a different cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson ’ s death, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's office was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that the investigators have verified.
The teenager ’ s parents said they hoped the video recordings would contain clues as to how he died.
CDC Publish Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-age children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to the CDC, the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among faculty and staff and how to deal with children with allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock - the car injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used - in order to be able to counter a potentially lethal hypersensitivity reaction.
State legislators have recently changed the rules to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it," or "My tongue is tingling."
Parents of intersexual children can choose "sex indefinitely"
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with ambiguous genitalia.
Newborn is no longer rigidly assigned to male or female.
Under the new law, parents will no longer have to declare gender for such children, but will be able to indicate "indefinite" or "unspecified" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to relieve pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding sex assignment operations in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersexual said years later, "I am neither man nor woman."
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and scarred.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children is not born a boy or a girl every year.
They belong to the group of intersexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis "sex differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US advise using the best available information for sex assignment if a determination is not possible and not waiting for the child's psychological and physical development before opting for surgery, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not," he said.
One could perform a sex assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity at all are not very accurate.
No one knows why.
It is like the mystery of why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people should be distinguished from transgender or transgender people, because their status is not based on gender, but on their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically defines both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them.
These characteristics were found in minor sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination to which intersex and transgender people are exposed in professional life, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not conform to the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May ’ s Welby (52) was recognized as the world ’ s first “sexless ” person after a court granted lifelong maintenance of an“ undetermined ” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German passports will in future have a third assignment, X for intersexual, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “gender theory ” from textbooks.
The U.S. American website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law on the grounds that "if the world is dragged into a new state where sex is a choice but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two other pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn baby from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would be better off if babies were assigned a sex at birth.
"Being a parent is stressful enough even without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the gender of your child," she told the parents' website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites after the attractive Greek god, who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine regarded gender as something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned, as it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender they assign.
"In the middle of the 20th century this was called a 'psychiatric emergency'," said Drescher.
When such a child was born, they called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender is malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental impulses - such as parents bringing up a child - interacted with a child's genes and hormones, thus shaping whether a person regarded himself or herself as male or female.
But in a case from 1966, known as "John / Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion, but it was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he changed back to male sex and married a woman.
But at 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practise this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations came to the public, who are "not happy with the outcome."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with male chromosomes but with ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was to undergo a vaginal plastic surgery.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he returned to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called the Interface Project to ensure that intersex people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar, executive director of California-based Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law could "encourage stamping and stigmatization."
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision might encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign the child a 'not fixed'," she said.
We fear that this will encourage intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we do not yet know what the law will do, so we can only speculate.
Ms Mattis said her organisation supported Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognised as a third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own choices about their legal sex," she said.
The German law deals with the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force young children to join at this time.
When they are grown up, they can decide on their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says German law "authorizes" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of testosterone target cells, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents space, so they do not have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do various tests and clarify things, giving them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way everything is fine - you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness.
And there is no need to rush into an operation that cannot be undone.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents have because they think they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the gender that suits him better - and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own decisions.
Unknown hurt girl by shot from car
Unknown persons injured a twelve-year-old girl in Saxony in shooting from a car.
The perpetrators allegedly fired on a group of children on Thursday evening in Genthin using an air force.
This was reported by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured in her left calf.
Rescuers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal investigation, it was said on Friday.
Until now, the Kempten police can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officers were summoned only twice to throw egg-throwing children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the house owners recognized this in time and removed the egg remainders immediately, probably also no damage should have arisen.
Furthermore probably also some New Year's Eve bullets were ignited in the city area, but also here no damage was caused.
A resident in the bishop ’ s friendly village way reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his wheel trims were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man found his wheel trim in the immediate vicinity of all again, so the police had to take no further action.
Living with future perspectives
Waltraud Ries actually lives in a dream.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, old trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
“Hopefully you ’ re not afraid of spiders? ” Waltraud Ries asks, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern that in old age the many steps to the house and in the apartment can no longer be mastered, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the woman in her mid-fifties has had to experience first-hand what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Recently she published a book on the topic 'Happy living in old age - which form of housing is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age ', she begins to tell.
When she moved into the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was simply a beautiful apartment surrounded by greenery.
Today, in his mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
However, she also knows that she is one of the few people to deal with the topic of 'living in old age' at all.
Most suppress it as long as it can.
Only the others grow old, 'she says with a smile.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you worry.
'Then it can be too late ', said Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
'The form of housing you choose, however, is always an individual decision ', she explains.
T he solution did not exist for the age.
Even those who can afford retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also become sick.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the national language, you can unite in the Dolce Vita,' says the author of the textbook.
Among their models are classical care models, alternative forms of housing or the often quoted pensioner flats.
In old age, everyone has his ticks and quirks
'For me such a flat would be nothing ', she says with a wink.
Especially not like in a student flat with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age, you simply need your retreat rooms', says Ries.
Nevertheless, the book author does not want to rule out the possibility that a senior citizen can nevertheless share a flat.
But this had to be done differently than in the classic student flat.
And sometimes you just want your peace and quiet, 'she believes.
With this opinion it does not stand alone there at least in the state capital.
'Most elderly people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as possible ', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of citizen services at the age of the state capital.
Your office advises people on the subject of 'getting older'.
Therefore straight older humans would accept frequently also inconveniences and restrictions, only in order to be able to remain in their used environment, that is also the experience of the donation goods test.
Today there are many possibilities to make the house or the apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends to all, which are occupied with the age-appropriate change of their house or their dwelling, to inform first of all thoroughly and not to assign the first best craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversions.
Even in the rented apartment one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer enlightens.
But the existing apartment cannot always be redesigned age-appropriate and therefore barrier-free, no matter how beautiful it is.
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience.
Although you could install a stairlift inside the apartment, the way to the apartment door, which is also paved with stairs, would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
She is more afraid of the move than of the spider at her apartment door.
U.S. intend to continue prosecuting Snowden
The US has not changed its position on former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.
He is also accused of having unlawfully passed on secret information.
Therefore, he must face criminal proceedings in the U.S., said the spokeswoman of the U.S. State Department, Jennifer Psaki, Washington.
The recent statements by Snowden would not change this either.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, the German Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the USA not to continue to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele ’ s remarks were those of a parliamentarian and not of a German government official.
In principle, intelligence agent Edward Snowden is willing to talk to the German authorities.
But first he wants his situation clarified.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee wanted by the USA in an unaddressed letter, which the Green Party politician Hans Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Prosecutor General.
According to a translation distributed by Ströbele, the letter has the following wording:
To:
I have been asked to write to you regarding your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was formerly employed by the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States as a contractual or direct technical expert.
In the course of my work in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government, which made me act out of a moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was subjected to a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of an all-encompassing surveillance system that is not accountable to anyone as a public service.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a betrayal and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
Nevertheless, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this damaging stance.
I hope that, once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to contribute appropriately and lawfully to the responsible clarification of the facts surrounding the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and I thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality sold the former kindergarten in Gartenstraße to a private individual.
The sale was approved by the municipal council in its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed hands at a "reasonable" price.
"The congregation is satisfied," Maier emphasizes.
The budget was set at EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house, such as heating, looking for the garden and clearing the sidewalk.
“This expenditure is now away ”, is pleased Maier.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the baton at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the musicians from Hammrich.
Chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully manage the first musical high.
Report: Obama ’ s campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 campaign, the New York Times said.
The unveiling is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin's and John Heilemann's long-awaited work about the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book, and on Thursday night it reported that the President's top advisers had "conducted extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011" to find out whether it would be better for Obama's waning hope of re-election if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, the Times ’ national political correspondent, the book traces thoroughly the history of efforts by senior campaign officials and the White House, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only a half-dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley, Obama ’ s former campaign leader, Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
"Double Down" claims that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to replace Biden, despite her "close personal ties," before finally deciding against such a move, after data showed that Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said quite a few things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
It is worth remembering that the President had terrible poll figures at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley called the investigation “due diligence, ” Martin told CNN ’ s Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the campaign for re-election to find out whether such a move paid off with regard to the ballot boxes.
"Campaigns don't spend as much money on surveys and focus groups if you don't think seriously about something," explained Martin on AC360.
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his former boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley said he did not believe that the president was "aware" of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that "double down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama's political probes had reached his desk.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama had not known anything about the investigation into whether Biden should be dropped in the election.
"Possible," Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E ’ Mail is actually called electronic letter.
Was the design of the Internet Service E, Mail similar to the conventional mail implemented technically the secrecy of letters?
When designing the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been designed to provide a stable basis for an audible exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
When user "Anna" sends an e-mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two connected directly?
The first step of the email program or Anna's browser is to send the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the route the mail can run over several other servers in the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Are traditional e-mails read on their way through the net?
Most mails are read several times by software on the way.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also performed on the recipient ’ s systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam, which is deleted immediately or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems like GMail, the robot also detects the information that Google needs to place contextual advertisements.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can show corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people read the e-mails?
The probability that unauthorized persons will read an e-mail is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
Law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies also have legal means to intercept or take note of e-mails.
There are also possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from being read?
With OpenPGP encryption, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to disguise the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even readily possible to recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the predominantly privately used mailboxes, according to a study by Convios Consulting in August 2013.
While Yahoo ’ s shares were down recently, Google ’ s GMail was able to increase significantly.
Mother buried in the forest and pension collected
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead woman in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care allowance.
In order to be able to collect further pension and care money, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother after investigations of the police in the forest.
First he covered up the death of 89 Years, then he has the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old must answer for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man became suspicious already in May: At that time it was noticeable that for the mother in need of care no more medicines were needed.
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had gone to Spain.
Because the officials thought it was strange, they continued to investigate.
It came out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had cared for them last.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an autopsy provided no evidence for a capital crime.
Fancy ice cream glowing in the dark?
A British entrepreneur developed the first glowing ice in the dark - with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous treat.
The idea came to him after he had read a research paper on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, whereby the pH value in the protein is raised and the glow is triggered.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and glows - so the more you lick, the lighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in ice cream reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
When the mouth heats up the protein, the pH increases and the ice shines.
We ’ ve been testing it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to market on Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made, because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie ’ s experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavours, which include beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is set to become even more ambitious.
He says, "I want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is in itself impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I suspect we are finding a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the league after six days of play.
Now of all times, Ingo Ehlers ’ team will face the derby against TSV Daverden tomorrow, which celebrated its first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts anew for us.
"I hope that we finally have our heads clear", Ehlers is cautiously optimistic.
With the exception of Hendrik Blohme, who is permanently injured, he finally has his entire squad at his disposal.
Like us, Daverden also relies on speed.
We must therefore keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is important to increase coverage, which has left a far from sure impression in the last few years.
Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that ’ s not the reason why we ’ re still the favourite, because everything can happen in the derby.
Nevertheless Panitz wants to follow up in Morsum to start a series.
Missing will Jan, Malte Jodat.
In return, the youth player Joost Windßuß, who is active with a right to double play in the German youth club HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I'm more of a Halloween Muffel geworden.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home, and I do not expect to do so this year.
But according to statistics, I ’ m a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million to be precise - celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of US $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the US Retailers Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the US $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, provocative inanimate items are all the rage.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I ’ m expecting lots of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk ’ s will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed up our dogs last year and to my surprise we were not alone.
Indeed, according to NRF, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes for their pets.
These are a lot of "hot dogs".
When it comes to sweets, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candies and gummy bears.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce, according to 41 Million people, with the slogan "sweet or sour" move through the neighborhoods.
In fact, we are going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - let's not fool ourselves - eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet candy corn; however, 15 million kilograms of it are sold for Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
That is about nine billion kernels of maize.
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it haunts.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually in a real prison), "Howl" O "Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are, in fact, 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that raise $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos of you peeing into your pants and then putting your friends on Facebook where you can ’ t get rid of them, and then leaving a comment by the guy you ’ re standing on like a “nice expression. ”
But let us finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree - something we did when we were small.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which is slowly rotting in the front garden, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you really want to score, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Home fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces recover charred corpse
The fire brigade had to disembark late Thursday evening in Helmbrechts.
A three-family house in the rural district of Hof catches fire on Friday night.
The rescue workers recover a charred corpse from the house.
Rescue workers found a charred corpse in a three-family home during a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
Late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire department arrived, the flames were already breaking out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the corpse in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
For the time being, the building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest regional church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently approximately 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030.
For young people of today the occupation is very attractive and offers good future prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in the discussion with the Protestant press service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine yourself.
With Burfien the regional church for the first time assigned a pastor on a full place to inspire young people for the study of theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduating from high school.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-churchization: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am in charge of my schedule and can set my priorities where it is important to me.
As pastors, pastors could be very close to the people.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well on it.
Certainly in the free economy more was paid, but for it theologians had a safe employer.
That would suit the young people of today, who are not only interested in careers, but in meaningful work.
According to the regional church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time about 40 graduates of theology begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz Mountains, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could be difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad education.
You can even become Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six points, seatbelts and a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler WORKS, mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed. ”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an achievable way to world-class events.
We are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers to the rigors and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge, which will be an entertaining championship.
The Defender Challenge also includes a training and test day in February and the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called to the rescue of a dog that was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry
Cockerspaniel ， female Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered in her predicament by a walker in the quarry
Firefighters abseiled off the rock face and saved the dog from certain death
The fire brigade managed to bring a dog to safety, which was stuck on a 15 meter high ledge in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old cocker spaniel, Ruby, ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who owned the dog, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for her missing dog and published cries for help in social networks, as she had escaped after the small traffic accident in the quarry.
Around 2: 15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker who was walking his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 metre high ledge in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station hurried to the spot and abseiled off to rescue Rubys, which was then transported upwards in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist of the rescue team, said: "She was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue - she was frozen stiff.
But now she is doing well.
She ate some dog cakes afterwards.
That was quite an unusual assignment.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, Technical Rescue Team Specialist, said, "Ruby had a huge stroke of luck."
There was a chance that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination, but found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "Watching the rescue was scary."
I couldn't believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her in her arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firefighters have done a great job.
What they did was really courageous.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid she would fall off, but she stayed up. ”
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never turned Katy Perry on when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background vocalist on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rocker and that "he offered me when I was 18."
She added, "That was a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70 year-old Jagger representative said he "categorically denied that he had ever approached Katy Perry."
The representative added, "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling / Stones ’ tour this year.
Their new album "Prism" went straight to number 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives Scots a choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition of EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian ’ s Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not matter in the headlines, as was expected.
Nor has anyone mentioned that the EU ’ s member states often bend their strict rules when it is more convenient for them.
As Scotland is not currently in the Schengen area, continuing to ignore it would be a small concession for Brussels in exchange for what we really want from the Scots.
So actually no story.
And one that has already grown so old that it already resembles a fossil: The first time I heard the "independence means passport control" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance to the European tune?
Why trade the London yoke for the Brussels yoke, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great post-war plan for European unification has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project has officially died.
Throughout the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as the common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany party - founded just this year - secured just under five million votes in the general election in September, effectively evicting the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket into which each national economy is forced by adherence to the single currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits - only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters - and German policymakers like to leave it that way.
Without the possibility of local currency depreciation, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending, spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives imposed by Brussels - a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry pays twice as much as the United States for electricity and four times as much for gas.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage fixes of the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is brewing, especially in France, the EU ’ s one-time cheerleader.
After the war, France ’ s political elite viewed the EU as a vehicle for holding Germany in check and raising Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, which the ailing French economy is struggling with.
The result: Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election, relegating the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France, with 24% of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that right-wing divisions will automatically benefit the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newfound popularity among white working-class French?
It would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-single currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and this is very possible - then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not-too-distant future, growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will unite to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and a few of its satellites, or economies, may cling to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of cajoling itself to the US.
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can put themselves in.
I suspect that Scotland could do quite well in a looser European interconnection if we kept our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider following Norway's lead and maintaining our economic independence.
Remarkably, the SNP ’ s Scottish government is the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a spectacular majority in 2011 over the proposed (and proposed) cuts by Labour ’ s finance minister, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose independence now, only to have austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as research shows.
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children ’ s health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter's breasts and pubic hair grow at the age of seven or eight?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics ’ annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and constituted a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents - usually this is not a sign that puberty is fast approaching," Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious indications of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (occurrence of the first menstruation) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it still takes at least two to three years until the menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: the essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually represents the onset of puberty, but it is "premature" when the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates - something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
With faster progress, tests by an endicronologist may be indicated to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments for delaying early menstruation and preventing another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reticent about drugs, but he admits: "Suppressing puberty can ease behavioral problems and girls' feelings of being different from their peers."
The other major problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter got her days at the age of ten.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school frightened and excited because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are causative.
Boys reach puberty like girls do.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a 2001 study on girls aged 6 to 9 years, which established a link between body fat and the onset of puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys grow their facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend towards full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference highlighted the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is widespread even among babies and toddlers.
"We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"That can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz advised.
If one remains calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than expected.
Jumbo indoor manufacturers argue about seat width in the face of large orders
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the breadth of seats in the economy on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the width of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class - not always those that airlines are most interested in, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus called this week for an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the tourist class, but US arch-rival Boeing says the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are vying to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
The design of the rear section of the aircraft - in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats - is crucial to the economic results reported for the new "Mini Jumbo" design.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" holds 406 people in economy class seats that are about 17 inches wide and allow so ten per row.
Airbus says the competing version of the A350 carries 350 passengers in 18-inch wide seats in the economy class, with nine in each row.
Aircraft giants often distribute blows about technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.
Now Airbus is making a direct appeal to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to win with over 100 orders placed.
Recently, the company introduced an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war, showing a picture of three people sitting squeezed together in a restaurant, with the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer to regional turbo props," says John Leahy, Airbus' Chief Sales Officer.
As dietary habits change, people become fatter, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average male American aged between 40 and 49 years increased by ten percent, according to data from the US Department of Health.
The average male American in the 21st century has a waist circumference of 100.8 cm, according to US health statistics.
Airbus says its rival adheres to a 1950s seating concept when the average body circumference of the freshly christened Jet Set was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out which have shown that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing denies the figures from Airbus on seating measurements and says that it is not up to the manufacturers to decide how airlines balance fares and facilities.
The company also explains that, according to research, the experience in an aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
"It really comes down to giving airlines the flexibility to do what they think they need to be successful," says Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don ’ t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly becoming an issue that can have an impact on sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the USA or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365 seated Boeing 77 300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X, with its ten seats per row, is compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than with presently used machines with ten seats per series.
"Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.
“Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus ’ offering is controlled by the threat of the 777, ” says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin furnishings, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world travelers jet, sellers even carry tape measurement with them to measure the device against the competition.
Even if they advertise comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a ten-seater A350, but says it has not yet sold one.
Until recently, Airbus emphasised the importance of greater cabin adaptability and offered wide aisle seats for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to fizzle out, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New nicotine vaccine could kill the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil smoking fun.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
More tests are needed before testing on humans, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and tried all the methods available on the market, but have found that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information needed to produce nicotine, or antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, leaving a smoker with no nicotine.
In experiments, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, had taken a "time-out", the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if it is safe, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thereby preventing nicotine addiction.
But smokers are more likely to use it to quit.
"They know that when they start smoking again, they no longer enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them get rid of their habit," he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid
Joe Tripodi, a former Labor Party minister from New South Wales, is under investigation by the State Corruption Inspectorate.
The former NSW ’ s minister denies having changed the rules on maritime lease at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings in three state-controlled properties.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission Against Corruption) extended its investigations into whether Obeid influenced various state ministers to renew leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without a call for tenders after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is being investigated on charges that Tripodi knew of Obeid ’ s hidden interest in the land after Tripod ’ s former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, testified on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pressed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which earned the Obeids 2.5 million dollars annually, were renewed without a public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister for Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally opted for public tenders.
But he denied having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pressed for a revision of the government ’ s lease arrangements.
A telephone transcript submitted to ICAC showed conversations in August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Ministry after working under Obeid at the Fisheries Agency.
"Was the subject of these telephone conversations the elaboration of commercial leasing arrangements?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," replied Tripodi.
I can ’ t remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn ’ t.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli planes attack target in Syria, sources say
Israeli fighters attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official told Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125.
This year Israel has already conducted air strikes on rocket deliveries in Syria at least twice.
Foreign workers with 457 "visas" could be "authenticated"
The government is considering a "authentication test" for foreign workers with a 457% visa as part of extended measures.
If the test were to be introduced, it would be based on a criterion designed to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for family and friends to move to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers for being perceived as an insult by Australia ’ s neighbors.
"Loud statements like 'foreigners should stand in the back' and 'Australians come first' are a very unpleasant relapse at a time when trade unions are demanding a protected labour market," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant protecting white workers - and if some in the region hear an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines 12 measures once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human trafficking, has implemented five of the proposed changes, the others are still under consideration.
If the 'authenticity criterion' is adopted, someone applying for a visa could be checked to see whether 'the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the holder or relevant person of the supporting entity'.
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visas holders, after hundreds were hired in the past by companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker probably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week in a refugee boat.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been looked after since his father ’ s death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK Government has announced a study to increase the benefits for Scotland of the HS2 rail project.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to build high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England from the start of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to be working with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of an eventual travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are moving ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crunch in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael said: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unequivocally" support Scottish involvement in the HS2.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK."
That is why we are pleased to be working as a partner of the UK Government to explore the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that will bring benefits to all and complement the Glasgow / Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British Ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Regulations on aircraft electronic equipment remain provisionally in force in Australia
Australian air passengers must continue to turn off tablets and smartphones when taking off and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) enables US carriers to change their policy so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases if they are in "flight mode".
During the majority of the flight, this is already allowed, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when taking off and landing.
Australian carriers observe the decision to implement which requires US carriers to do vast amounts of work, but have no immediate plans to change their regulations.
The CASA also said it would look at the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases still apply in Australia.
"The CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in aircraft", it was announced.
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow safety instructions issued by cabin crew.
Virgin has already had discussions with the CASA on extending the use of its Wi ’ Fi ’ entertainment system on flights and declared that it was open to changes, but that these had to be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of CASA's approval of electronic devices as we believe this would enhance the customer experience as we now offer (wireless entertainment) in-flight," a spokesperson said.
Qantas said they would stick to the current regulations for the time being.
"Our current directives do not allow electronic devices to be used during take-off and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," the company said.
The FAA rules apply to US carriers.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will certainly look closely at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects US carriers differently depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate mobile interference and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage, programmes and customer training.
“Once an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, eBook, readers and smartphones at any height, ” the FAA announced.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to switch off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when taking off and landing.
Before the district derby against Schalke had traveled with BVB supporters with flares provided for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced tough consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - initially.
It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustics that offered the viewer until shortly before the kick-off of the Bundesliga match between the German runner-up Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park.
We mainly listened to the guest fans with their songs.
The Südtribüne on the other hand, where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, was at first exceptionally quiet: No chants, no battle cries.
The podium of the Capo, which coordinates otherwise the common cheering, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the grandstand a big flag with the inscription "Sektion Stadionverbot" was waving.
Only as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller entered the pitch as the first BVB player, a short cheer flared up.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the Südtribüne nothing moved.
Also the fact that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel listed the positive experiences of the last days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause a festive mood.
Only five minutes before the kick-off the Capo climbed up his pedestal - and the tension, which had been palpable until then, discharged in a loud scream when Dickel queried the atmosphere on the stands in the stadium as usual.
Last but not least, it was the turn of the Südtribüne - and finally, as usual, it was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derby winner gets up" came with kick-off from the Südtribüne, everything was back as usual.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before the derby at FC Schalke 04 some of the BVB supporters had fired flares into the spectators and onto the pitch - and nearly hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was kicked off late because of the chaotic scenes.
As a result, BVB boss Hans BÃ ¤Joachim Watzke had received the heads of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fans' representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the whole Ultra Movement", BVB's "Boss" announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke forbade the Ultras a choreography for their home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbade that," he explained.
The zero tolerance policy in pyrotechnics we can not give up.
In addition, the Ultras were shown various ways of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, Watzke said, BVB will impose a sanction until the end of next week.
"That's going to be drastic," Watzke assured.
It will be interesting to see what the reactions in the Südtribüne will be.
Pawnbrokers booming in Singapore as middle-class crisis hits
In a pawn shop in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings in order to be able to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, I put all my money in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (approx. 1,730 euros) every month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not sufficient, she explains.
Indeed, in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – demand is so high that ValueMax, where it has made its exchange, became the third pawnbroker listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Pledging jewellery is not only a quick way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga - but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnbrokers in Singapore require an annual APR of 17%, just above the 15.4% charged by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage that there is no need to check creditworthiness or income, which is why loans are possible more quickly than with banks.
As a result, millions of people in the region turn to pawnbrokers as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and household and consumer indebtedness.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to loose fiscal policies in developed economies, low- and middle-income families seek out pawnbrokers to make up the difference in a stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor ’ s called growing household debt, mainly through rising mortgages, a risk factor for Asian banks ’ creditworthiness.
According to the Agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia tops the list with 80% of GDP, an increase of 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has just emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
“In the end, as costs rise, middle-to-lower-income people will try to supplement their income wherever possible, ” says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks in gold prices over the past two years have amplified the trend toward mortgaging personal belongings, as people seize the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged objects in the 200 pawnbrokers of the city-state are gold.
People say to themselves, "The price of gold looks good, let's pledge grandma's gold chain and get it back next month."
The largest Thai pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent increase in customer numbers in its stores in recent months.
ValueMax, which operates the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, will not only expand into neighboring Malaysia – where it operates four stores – but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax ’ s Managing Director.
The company is funding it with 60 percent of Singapore ’ s $66 million that it earned this week with its IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire over high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnbrokers not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
"Customers lend items they already own, and liquefaction of personal valuables does not increase household debt," she explains.
The pawn loan business is increasingly socially accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pawnshops are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social class come to us.
“These include wealthy people who borrow for business or investment in the short term, or small businesses who need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks, ” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Edward Snowden, the secret service ’ s investigator, has a fundamental interest in helping Germany investigate the NSA ’ s spying affair, which is becoming increasingly explosive.
According to the Green Party, Member of the German Bundestag Hans “Christian Ströbele ”, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former German intelligence service employee would testify at a German public prosecutor ’ s office or before a committee of inquiry.
According to Ströbele, Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation in Germany.
Rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions attached to the $325 million Australian health bailout package to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian deputy Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency electoral assistance.
A further 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments for cataracts, are intended to remove residues.
There is also money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-hospital care, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of an electronic health record system in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that affected hospital staff have told me are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability by the Tasmanian Government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission will be established to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use if "it is not accompanied by real reforms that put Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable path."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system from the list of concerns, ” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these electoral benefits will largely offset the recent cuts.
But Peter Dutton, the opposition's health spokesman at the federal level, believes that today's announcement is only a "plaster solution."
"We are in the current situation because the labor state government has withdrawn 430 million dollars from the health system," he told ABC TV.
It is not acceptable for a state government to take nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and put 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretend that this is good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux 'adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but it is also heavier than necessary.
The story, set in France in the 1760s, tells the moving story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slides into lechery or sensationalism - and that is its problem.
The solemnity with which the film is told also makes it a tormenting penitent shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and lattice gas ammunition, said the Global Monitoring Group on Chemical Weapons on Thursday, while in the north of the country there were serious clashes near one of the sites where toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement made by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the
1 November, which the Damascus-based organization in The Hague had set to destroy or render "inoperable" all facilities for the production of chemical weapons, including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all of Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
But Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting was taking place on Thursday in the city of Safira, where experts say there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which is monitoring the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them were members of President Bashar Assad ’ s army, 18,678 were pro-government fighters, and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in the conflict at 100,000 since March 2011.
This figure has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad ’ s forces have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have ties to al Qaeda ’ s groups.
The observatory said there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not give any details.
The fighting underscores the danger to which the chemical weapons inspectors are exposed, because their mission to free Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is "now convinced that it has seen and experienced the destruction of all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
The inspectors said that due to security concerns it was not possible to visit two facilities.
On Thursday, the OPWC said that, according to Syrian sources, the two sites had been "abandoned... and the chemical weapons program facilities there had been moved to other facilities that had been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has put forward a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I salute the bravery and courage you have all shown in carrying out the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Monitoring Organization, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad ’ s government and its security forces, to which many members of the Alawites belong, a secession of Shia Islam.
Regarding further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that on Wednesday there had been a strong explosion at an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Anger at Judgment for Bali Bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angrily to the verdict of the last of the instigators, who were brought to justice because they believed that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who has been on the run for almost ten years as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bomb attack.
He could be released after 15 years with a stay.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many more.
A conviction was also handed down on a number of terrorist charges, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who is also called "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as a master bomb builder.
The decision has awakened painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation wrought by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago.
Fighting in tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
Every day I have to live with the fact that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times while attached to a life-support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
To keep him alive - no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali ’ s legal bombers.
He escaped arrest for nearly a decade, but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden barely four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of reconnecting Southeast Asian terrorist groups with al Qaeda.
"He didn't stand," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has caused to other people.
The verdict comes before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which is commemorated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but not make mobile phone calls)
From departure to landing, passengers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, listen to music and watch films, but not to use their mobile phones, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented would depend on the airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines will have to demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new Directives and that they have updated the training manuals for flight staff and the rules for stowing equipment in line with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers have to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not take off again until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the approach, passengers must switch them off again and must not take off again until the aircraft has landed.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use the equipment during take-off, landing and on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most of the new commercial aircraft and other planes that have been modified for the use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Flight Attendants Association, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely - and we are working closely with the airline on this - both sides will benefit," Glading commented.
To be honest, we are tired of feeling like watchdogs on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometers remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to publicly leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, must continue to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight also remain forbidden.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national traffic safety expert on CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we at FCC know that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmitter towers," says Rosenker.
Last month, an industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA to ease restrictions on use has increased.
Critics such as Missouri ’ s Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill argue that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of equipment has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, it is said that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore switching off the device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travellers in 1966, after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication equipment caused by airborne VHF radios became known, representing the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that they do not mind electronic interference.
For some years now, airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi when the flight altitude is reached.
The aircraft adapted to WiFi-systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for increased use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
A reader, for example, only emits minimal radiation when turning pages.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Proponents of loosening restrictions on passenger use include Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle E-readers and made a test flight to determine problems, but could not determine any.
Members of the FAA ’ s Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed that the equipment was causing real disruption, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only occasional reports of pilots arguing for aircraft systems to be disrupted by the equipment, and most of them were very old.
The committee, however, recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the passengers to switch off the equipment when instruments are landed in poor visibility.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a sensible adjustment for travellers who would be well equipped with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not contradict safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird rescued by air rescue service from North Sea
A bird, flown to the coast by air rescue service and found exhausted on a North Sea oil rig, was released back into nature.
The water rail was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was nursed by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in their rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, director of the centre, said: "This water rail was probably a winter migratory bird from Northern Europe, stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling platform.
He added, "He couldn't fly on, so we were contacted for help."
When she was released, the Water Rail was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the aim of bringing the economy around the table and defining what those who provide wealth and work in Britain want to change in our relations with the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them what they think about Britain, the economy, and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, who roughly represent the UK ’ s corporate sizes, sectors, and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and concentrating on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to favor new trade links with countries like China, India, and Brazil, rather than embarking on the long and arduous process of reforming obscure EU institutions.
When asked about their views on certain statutory issues – from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the Internal Market, because, according to companies, the costs of the Brussels rules would outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trading zone - even 40% of large companies, which are traditionally the most pro-European, agreed.
Finally, and probably most importantly, our questioning of business leaders revealed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards changing the deal and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, which can be found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change" that will bring the lever of action back to Great Britain.
There is much at stake - a change to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16% change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubts: this poll shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate Britain ’ s terms for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible, and increasingly necessary, as the eurozone moves toward closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the results of our survey show, which means increased attention to trade for businesses and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, explained Gazprom ’ s CEO.
"Today's event is a milestone: construction has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream, the largest and most important project in Europe," Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to increase the diversity of Russia ’ s export routes through Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe, increases the risk on conventional routes, as official sources say.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project comes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction will begin in other sub-contracting countries along the planned year-end route.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors there is no way around Germany as a real estate location.
The economic fundamentals are correct and the funding possibilities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th Real Estate Day of the stock exchanges ’ newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country by European standards.
This was pointed out by Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa by Jones Lang LaSalle, on the 9th Real Estate Day of the stock exchanges.
As searched German trade real estates are, the view of the transaction volume shows, so Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it grew by 31% compared to the same period last year.
The increase was only 6% in Great Britain and 19% in France.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive return," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and government bonds is at a historically high level.
The FAA relaxes restrictions on the use of electronic devices in airplanes, even if the use of mobile phones remains prohibited.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA team members face charges of sex crimes against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with child sex offenses before the 2011 charges against Caringbah child caregiver Jonathan Lord were heard by the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
However, in the opening statement to the commission, the YMCA had stated that "there has never been an incident of child sexual abuse in the organization."
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case where a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences and another where a YMCA sports teacher Caringbah Hall had been convicted in 1991 for the abuse of children entrusted to him.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, that he knew of the first case but did not know of the second.
He acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that "there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety".
On the contrary, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest score of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August this year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that management had failed to hire Lord "from my point of view downwards" and had failed to ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the Child Safety Guidelines.
Lord was convicted at the beginning of the year for sexual offences committed against twelve boys during his two years of service for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Lord ’ s violations of children ’ s safety.
The staff said they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with children, taking care of them privately as a babysitter, letting them sit on his lap, saying to one that he loved it, and letting children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord Superior at the YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very aloof."
The chief executive said he would not accept statements from employees who did not dare to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, so they did not report him.
Hare said he had communicated his view to the Board of Directors of YMCA NSW that the lesson the organization had to learn from the "Jonathan ’ Lord ’ incident" was "not about reporting" by staff, and the Board had agreed.
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations occurred was made by Liam Whitley, director of the YMCA Children's Services.
He said it was meant to prevent contamination of the evidence, but it was "overzealously" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children when Jonathan Lord worked there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, told the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in recruiting, reviewing, familiarising, training and supervising staff.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the chance to return as British Prime Minister - but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since retiring in June 2007, after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British policy, limiting his comments mostly to foreign policy and his role as envoy to the Quartet of Middle East Peacemakers.
Asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard in London as saying: 'Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so...'
When the show attracted crowds of experts to Cardiff to select the Horse of the Year, they knew that there was a tough competition ahead.
But nobody was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The kid, who isn ’ t even in kindergarten yet and made his first steps only a few months ago, and his Shetland, Pony Toffee trot through the three rounds loosely and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
At his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had put on his plate cap at a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old Toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in handling the pony, which were far above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then had practiced every day with the Shetland Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field and left the field with a gold cup and a rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells said, "The whole audience was electrified and everyone cheered and clapped on him."
He ran the entire length of the arena on sand and although he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of.
As it has started, it will not be long before it is on the Horse of the Year show - and I am sure it will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony."
Together they are a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee according to how well they had performed and presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leader - and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I ’ m sure that Fenton ’ s cute clothes did their part to make this fit the occasion perfectly.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had demanded the release of a reporter accused of defamation on the front page, is to be reformed, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou based Neue Express had issued a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to falsify reports of a state-owned company.
Now the New Express is undergoing "full rectification," the regulator said.
The "rectification order" was issued by the Guangdong Department of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
Preliminary investigation revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," announced the regulator in a statement.
She said that she had decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license."
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to carry out a full rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant persons responsible for the New Express and to immediately review the leadership team of the New Express."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction machinery named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and backed his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he published false reports for a fee.
"In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was after money and fame.
I realised that I was wrong.
Following Chen ’ s apology, the New Express posted an apology on the front page, stating that it had failed to review the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a law change earlier this year that prohibited the authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel with own railway between the USA and Mexico discovered
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico, which was completely equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railways, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 by 90 centimetre tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported undetected, the authorities said.
According to court records, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were seized during the discovery of the tunnel.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison terms ranging from ten years to life if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, challenging drug cartels to quickly deliver their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 640-meter-long passage with rails running from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go their separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has commented on the separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, which was due to air on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "life sometimes doesn't run exactly as we plan or hope it will."
Kerr and he still loved himself, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support and love each other as Flynn's parents".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
The Veganismus is subordinate according to the lexica to the vegetarianism, differs from this however in completely substantial way.
While vegetarians allow themselves the consumption of cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam, these feasts are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, apart from the renouncement of meat and fish the Veganer leaves from all consumption of animal products - also honey is negated.
What remains, one may ask oneself, but on closer inspection the vegane nourishing world is characterised by a considerable imaginativeness.
"Spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local health food store, who has a large number of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop on Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealander lives vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
At the turn of the century the next step took place and I became a vegan.
“The conviction came however not only because of the nutrition, but because of the shoe choice ”, says Proctor, which prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realized that in other everyday matters, too, it is possible to do without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethic.
"I don't want animals to have to die for me," says Proctor, expressing the maxim of vegans, which extends to the entire consumer behaviour.
Instead of mourning burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products and the enthusiasm grew.
“It ’ s a double bonus, ” Proctor says today,“ in fact, being vegan isn ’ t a sacrifice, it ’ s not asceticism, it ’ s an enrichment. ” Assuming that dietary conversion reduces the choice of eating options, Proctor attributes it more to the power of habit.
And it was precisely these conditionings that led to the failure of many a well-intentioned attempt.
"The addictive factor is a crucial factor that makes many people give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor compares.
And observes: "Certain tastes are not to be fastened to the animal".
It is often the spices or the type of preparation that makes the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.
At a barbecue, Proctor brings eggplant, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages.
It pays attention to a balanced, varied nutrition, with which it should taste quite also once hearty.
Of course you want to have something between your teeth, that is legitimate.
"It should taste good, but that is not to be reduced only to animal food", so Proctor.
Health damage up to eating disorders, another common assumption, he had not suffered.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I do not absorb foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who only eat vegan food.
"My blood values are excellent, I often get checked," reveals Proctor.
Many vegansimus critics especially warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed on feed instead of grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether the proportion of vitamin B12 in the meat bought in the freezer is high," says Proctor.
Vegans also have the opportunity to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 ’ s values are fine, ” he explains.
Proctor does not have to take long paths for food procurement.
Basic foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I find everything I need on site.
Only from time to time I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but as we know, the same applies to" ordinary "finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than commonly assumed.
"There is a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few little tricks you can achieve good, if not better, results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor could also make his parents-in-law wonder.
The vegan adds a new spice to family celebrations.
That is dynamic, when you cook together, it has a new significance.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he has also been met with scepticism.
Don't you like my food any more?
"Should I feel bad now, because I drink milk?" - with such questions one must act as Veganer with finger point feeling.
"I do not reject people, I am part of this society", Proctor does not want to become an enclave.
And more exactly regarded then the everyday life does not seem so veganfremd as presumed - and the Veganer not so in the everyday life limited as generally accepted.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are fries everywhere!
"Many kebab shops offer falafel, or a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he prefers pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants slowly adapt to this.
"When I started to eat vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult", the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to the people, make them aware of it".
"If there are enough requests, they may be inclined to add to the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the galley in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor hopes that other restaurants will also have at least one vegan dish on their menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make the vast majority impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, purchasing vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Particularly when one learns to understand that peanuts can also contain animal additives as a colouring agent, one seems to quickly lose courage in following ethics with so many hurdles and traps.
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to both food and cleaning products.
"Gradually one develops a view of the scanner and knows which signs and logos one has to pay attention to" It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble ", Proctor knows.
The Veganismus, it is an important moral pointer, which strikes on the consciousness.
Maybe he doesn ’ t quite manage to get rid of his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to keep its customers in suspense.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon.
In a communication, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. options markets, including two on Nasdaq OMX, continued to do so unhindered.
The latest incident continues a series of minor and major breakdowns with the operator.
It was only on Tuesday that the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August this year there had been two breakdowns in just one week.
Initially, Goldman Sachs, a US investment bank, had sent massively flawed purchase orders to options markets because of technical problems.
As a result, the exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and cancel the orders.
Two days later, half of all equity trading in the US came to a standstill for several hours due to a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq ’ s stock exchange.
Last year, the IPO of Facebook also caused a sensation.
NASDAQ ’ s systems were unable to cope with the flood of buy and sell orders, and were later found by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which fined the company a record $10 million.
Constance: Cyclists around 63 Years
The accident happened, according to the police, when a 26-year-old man was riding a women ’ s bicycle on the left-hand sidewalk from the station square in the direction of Marktstätte on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man stepped from a restaurant onto the sidewalk, the bicycle driver could not stop in time according to the police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course and sustained a 15-centimetre-long segregation wound on his head.
An ambulance team brought the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police issue an extradition notice to Assange
The British police today handed over an extradition order to WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australian had been sent a "request to stand," which invited him to appear at a police station, and added that if he did not do so, he was threatened with arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on charges of a sex offence after his options under UK law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition earlier this month.
Since he feared that Stockholm would extradite him to the USA, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has "sent an invitation to a 40-year-old man to come to a police station at the time we chose," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The Embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged with possible espionage charges after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the investigative website WikiLeaks.
Driver raced between his legs at 210 km / h with a hot drink will be fined £1,000
A car driver was fined £1,000 for driving at up to 210 km / h with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they found the cup between his legs.
Howie pleaded guilty before the District Court of Colchester without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay a cost of £90 and a £100 victim fee.
Tax on Foreign Property Owners Against London ’ s Bubble
The Treasury has provisionally recalculated the CGT measures, but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget imposed a 7% stamp duty on apartments costing over £2 million, as well as annual fees for buyers holding housing as a company, not as individuals.
Already, stamp income from residential property in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which amounted to £708 million in 2012-13, exceeds the combined revenues of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "Following the increases in stamp duty on high-priced housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against circumvention, it is difficult to claim that high-value property is taxed too low, regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system."
"But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy property in London or discourage owners from selling," he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in London ’ s affluent Southwest Belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market", with the south-western part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experiencing an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the relationship between the tail wagging of a dog and its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wagged their tails more to the right (from the dog ’ s point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right hemispheres react differently to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noticed that in dogs, just as in humans, the right brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the waving tails of their conspecifics, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the dogs and analysed their behaviour.
Probably we will understand soon, why the tail moves sometimes in one, sometimes in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise inexpressive dog moved its tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wagging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog waving), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not communicate intentionally with each other through these movements.
He is rather convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience, with which movements they should worry and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wagging with the tail in one direction is more connected with friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, a dog behaviour expert and guest fellow at the University of Bristol Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right are important for dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a satisfied dog.
In another research paper at the University of Victoria, Canada, the following was stated: "Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog when its' tail 'waves to the left and not to the right, rather than becoming restless - exactly the other way around than in the Italian study."
According to his statement, the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details have yet to be determined – and dogs are no exception, ” Bradshaw said.
Since their behaviour can be easily recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.

Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will on 22 February for the first time appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the most senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who elect a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election - this belongs to a group of 120 "cardinals entitled to vote".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, spokesman for the Vatican, said that there would be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony to nominate the new cardinals, also known as the consistory, would be held.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance, so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinals eligible to vote would probably have fallen by February.
He said that a Pope normally appoints as many cardinals as necessary to restore the number of cardinals eligible to vote to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he desires.
According to Valero, the Consistory next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year.
At the moment, there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe, particularly Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called, since the creation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight Cardinals from all over the world, charged with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything by himself.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him, ” Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that Francis asked the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation - this is all new.
Valero said that typically bishops from large places are called to be cardinals, but Francis was "full of surprises - we do not know who he appoints".
GM Calls Back New Pickup Trucks in the United States to Repair the Seat Backrest
General Motors is calling back just under 19,000 of its all-new Chevrolet Silverado- and GMC Sierra ’ s 2014 pickup trucks to fix a problem with the manually adjustable backrest, the US automotive safety regulator announced Friday.
At some of the cars there can be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Vehicle Safety Directives for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is driven from behind, it is possible that the head restraint does not protect the occupants properly, so there is an increased risk of injury," read the message on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of GM ’ s trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading US automaker since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of the new Silverado and Sierra trucks developed for the 2014 model year increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado trucks and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM ’ s stock on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to 37.47 US dollars on Friday afternoon.
Obama ’ s cry of despair
I elected President Obama twice in the hope that change was possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy doesn ’ t excuse the Obamacare website ’ s trouble making drone strikes
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what might have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It is a book that I thought would cheer me up and give me hope during the gloomy second year of my medical studies.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's memoirs on the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient transcripts in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take one ’ s breath away.
The election became a landslide victory, and news spokesmen paused to recall the historic significance of the moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a nasty awakening, like being ripped out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first voted, things have indeed changed.
But it's just not something I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and diverse things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the army ’ s forced concealment of homosexuality, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I agree that the party-political blockade tactic has overturned too many of the efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But, having defended the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end of my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade cannot explain why foreign leaders are allowed to be intercepted or innocent children killed by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans ’ private lives, and why whistleblowers who expose government misconduct are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits were circumvented during the presidential election.
It does not justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to immobilize the media are "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that the work of government could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the legislature is not a predictable course of action, as an opposition party and accidental events like the Newtown Massacre are shaping public debate.
But when I look at the examples above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a bewildering and half-baked alternative; he seemed incapable of determining his direction and positions.
It seemed to me that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had long heard about.
But, with Obama ’ s approval rating falling below 45% this week, the book has made the return to 2008 all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week, I read a section in the book describing how Obama suffered a heavy loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
In a meeting with the election officials after the decision, he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their case.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We must remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr President, and I could not agree more with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer Claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott Has Conflict of Interests on Parental Leave
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit.
The mining magnate, in the midst of a legal battle over the payment of $6 million in CO2 taxes, made the claim when asking whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four Senate votes that are important in deciding whether to cut or eliminate CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest, and Abbott ’ s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets leave or not, ” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission declared Palmer to be the official winner of the Washington Sunshine Coast headquarters, 53 votes ahead of the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the counting process to make it faster.
Tony Abbotts daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which people march in, enter the data into a computer, dial immediately and then have the result at 6: 30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Do you use it because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
Nowadays, voting with pencils is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously".
A public office is about public service.
"We are not seeking any reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve this community at a critical time," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, according to two people familiar with the situation, another indication that the global regulatory investigation into alleged manipulation of the currency market is gathering speed.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in investigations in the world's largest financial market, where 5.3 trillion US dollars change hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation into the Libor ’ s interbank business scandal.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from the authorities.
"Our investigation on this issue continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation indicated that RBS had forwarded the recordings of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is said to have been suspended from his current position as European head of the Forex Spot, Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers was accused of any wrongdoing.
Usher ’ s instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma stated that it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have colluded in transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has thrown traders into turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year has been under pressure because low currency volatility is limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of forex trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks means that "even with a very small ticket, you can influence the market".
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired a trader from its London Exchange Traded Fund office this week after causing a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed and cooperated with the competent authorities.
"We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained," explained Credit Suisse.
Painted the fence on the Bechtle
A group of citizens' initiative "Swiss Meadow" has embellished the construction fence on the Bechtle Land at the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
She also cleaned and widened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the crumbling house in the rear part of the property was not permitted for safety reasons, because the area threatens to slip off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had arranged the beautification with his colleague Reinhard Domke from BI.
Before the BI action, a banner with the message "We are for it" had been put up.
This did not bother the 20 or so members of the citizens' initiative.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins".
With this she wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the gigantic project fail one day.
In the conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction site" it became clear that some citizens believe that many will be better off with the realization of the project of the city, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign, because the city continues to delay these answers, according to the BI.
As we have heard, the Mayor's public statements also have an impact.
May had said in the council meeting, that he fears the end of the thermal spa, should the population vote in the referendum against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some therefore seem to be almost frightened, others see it as a "crude blackmail attempt" on the population, continues the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the colour and all the helpers.
Rangnick ’ s scolding for Schiris: Mane no swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current top form of Bundesliga championship leaders Red Bull Salzburg, as disappointed was the sports director of the "cops" by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of swallow kings," he defended the two offensive whirlers at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest reason for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at the 3: 0 against Grödig last Sunday, where the Senegalese was doomed to an alleged acting - which was certainly not, as the TV pictures showed.
"A blatant miscalculation," Rangnick said, describing referee Harkam as "totally overwhelmed."
Furthermore, Harkam would have "played his part" in the escalation between Salzburg ’ s coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig ’ s coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He firmly defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation."
Schmidt himself does not want to have had any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I do not know why.
"Because I'm the one who was insulted," stressed the 46 year-old.
In view of the success, Rangnick sang the praises.
"There are only two words for it: Really good", he stated.
There is not much to complain about.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It should go on like this.
Changes in the cadre in the winter, transfer time there will hardly be.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Unless a player approaches with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick clarified.
Supreme Court upholds Obama ’ s health bill
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court ruled today that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five votes to four, the judges ruled that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ’ s sole mandate – forcing US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a fine by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy ruled against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2,700 page law and also took the view that the health law ’ s requirement that states must either extend access requirements for Medicaid or that otherwise all state funding for Medicaid would be deleted was not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit against the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The bill was firmly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates in the 2012 primary, including eventual challenger Mitt Romney.
Norway: Norwegian place lights up with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low level of sunshine, Rjukan, situated in the Vestfjord, usually sinks into the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 metres, a dream of the century came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" enthused Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some of the inhabitants of the valley adjusted themselves to sun chairs, others put on sunglasses as a precaution.
Until now, sun worshippers had to take a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen proposed to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
But this basic idea had existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally approved the 5 million kronor (around 615,000 euros) project.
A similar construction provides for some years the Italian Alpine village Viganella winter sunshine.
Post hardly empties on Sundays
“Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red points for the Sunday blank are still at different letterboxes of the core city and the quarters, but one reads the small print on the yellow containers of the post office AG, one finds fast out that the emptying does not take place on Sundays and holidays any longer ”, communicates the FDP.
A request of the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only in front of the post office building in the Ernst, Ludwig, Straße 36 and in the Jakob, Müller, Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether in court home and rose garden also still Sunday is emptied, in the answer to the inquiry of the FDP one does not answer.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
The Sunday lease is an important postal service, especially for appointments.
"Despite the price increase for letters on January 2013, this undertaking radically and unreasonably thinned out this."
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Liberal Group and the City Council, supports his group colleague: "What annoys me is the fact that the emptying times are being changed or even deleted secretly here."
The post office is miles away from the people.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays", Bittner and Röhrenbeck unanimously agree.
Also for the core city applies, particularly not mobile fellow citizens must be able to reach a letterbox with Sunday reading also within walking distance.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration plans discussions with the post office about this thing.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post office had not communicated with Lampertheim.
But to his knowledge there was also a Sunday lecture in Hofheim.
Your party has advocated privatisation.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt parking charges to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become considerably more expensive.
This morning, the city ’ s magistrate is discussing a proposal from the Department of Transport Stefan Majer (Green Party).
Accordingly, the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, the aim is not to raise the prices, but to shorten the time interval of parking meters and ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council has to decide.
The Retail Committee of the Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce considers this "not a good idea".
The parking possibility directly before the business is “an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller specialized dealers ”.
The transport club Germany is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast Actions Surprise Hosts
With a narrow squad, the men I of TSV Freudenstadt had to play against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller ’ s school gymnasium in Reutlingen.
The elders stood with an experienced team on the other side of the net.
Soon it turned out, however, that they, also due to age, could not quite keep up with the fast actions of the people of Freudenstadt.
With the hard and placed serve, the Gönninger were extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz played cleanly across the middle of the net and were not on the spot for the block defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the people of Freudenstadt in all matters.
In view of this overwhelming and game-determining performance, the third set was won somewhat laxly and listlessly to the 3: 0 final score (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).
On November 2, the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to prevail in Nagold, will be a much more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
The second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the 2nd class in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused faults and points gifts, especially at the ball acceptance; also with the passes the precision was sometimes scarce and in some critical game scenes the overzealousness prevented the view for possible point wins.
In this performance-wise very balanced meeting, Marcus Blasutto ’ s team in TSV TSV voted consistently for the great physical effort and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
A group of committed participants met at the small Englishmen ’ s hut in Ibach for what is now the fifth day of care to succeed Natura 2000 ’ s Upper Hotzen Forest project.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view of the valley around the hut should be cut open on this day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the highlight of the Gorge Trail, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasized that the Care Day was a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time with the touristic aspect also the ecological consideration could be found.
Friederike Tribukait from the department of nature conservation of the regional council Freiburg explained this ecological aspect after the welcome by district administrator Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the goal of farsightedness is to preserve the overgrown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening up and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
They need these free connections for the conservation of species.
Tribukait said that she did not want to fail to take up the cudgels at this point for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure would not only fit seamlessly into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized UNESCO status and thus a continuous supplement to what has been achieved with the LIFE project and the previous care days for the future.
After these different explanations district leader Christoph Wehle and Life is project manager Cornelia Bischoff assigned the aids into groups.
The larger trees had already been cut in advance, the forestry tractor was available if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a drystone bar.
The goal was an unobstructed view at the viewpoint.
Löffingen: Köpfler still only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future-oriented school, children, youth and senior citizens policy, as well as its own municipal utilities can be described as an attractive town, no second mayor candidate has yet applied.
So far, the 46-year-old bank clerk and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has been the only candidate to succeed Mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for retirement.
The deadline for applications is Monday, 11 November, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel ’ s patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, filed an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the company that it outbid in Nortel ’ s bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel ’ s patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd., HTC Corp, Huawei, and four other companies for patent infringements in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of seven patent infringement cases.
According to the lawsuit, the patents relate to technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertisements, thereby hitting at the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google ’ s Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple ’ s and Microsoft ’ s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel ’ s patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered 4.4 billion U.S. dollars.
After being beaten by Rockstar ’ s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola ’ s library of patents.
"Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the litigation patents at the auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so," the plaintiff said.
Rockstar is demanding heavy damages from Google since it claims Google ’ s patent infringement was intentional, the allegation said.
Egypt swears in first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of Egypt ’ s political strife.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration at the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court, who are dressed in black robes. The court has its seat at the Nile and is based on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Morsi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that, since its founding 84 years ago, has mostly been sharply targeted by the government as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o ’ clock local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and, unlike Mubarak ’ s presidential pageantry, traffic was only temporarily halted so that the car convoy could cross the usually busy street that connects the city center to the southern suburbs.
Mocked as an uncharismatic "spare wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but of all those who wanted to make the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak the goal.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wood-paneled chamber where he took the oath of office.
Later Morsi went to Cairo University to give his inaugural address.
He was officially welcomed by an army band that played the national anthem, which he listened to in great esteem.
The military leader field marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival he was greeted by hundreds of people in the largest auditorium of the university with chants of "The army and the people are one hand".
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir ’ s square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the Military Council had taken over from the ousted head of state.
However, by taking the official oath before the court and not, as usual, before parliament, he is bowing to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi ’ s Tahir Square speech was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger disco ensures two great evenings
The new season at the "Blue Velvet" disco in Falkenberg has begun.
On today's Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on tomorrow's Saturday evening it goes on with a party of 25 nights.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers of course on both days.
Worker crashed from ladder: seriously injured
While replacing a defective external sensor fell on Thursday a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg of a ladder and injured heavily.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the exterior façade of an inn.
As he climbed the ladder leaning against the gutter, it slipped away and the man fell to the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to the Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Rape in South Africa: Twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim later died from the consequences of the serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty of the crime at the beginning of the week.
The act had provoked national horror.
The then 21-year-old had Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town raped.
The doctors fought for the victim ’ s survival for 14 hours, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so terrible that the nurses and sisters needed psychological support.
Cana had admitted during the trial that he had been in a bar with Booysen during the night of the crime.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped her, but denied that he was responsible for the girl ’ s death.
The police initially assumed that there were several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecution also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that Cana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost a daily occurrence in South Africa, with around 64 000 cases of sexual violence reported every year.
This is almost ten times as many as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the number of unreported sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times higher.
Jumbo visits Black Forest Ham
Jumbo looking for the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" visited the Pro7 star Bonndorf.
Right at the start, the speaker makes it clear that the most important thing for the ham is the leg of the pig, and turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
So can the ham you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains to Jumbo how the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
He only comes inside the factory with his coat and coat.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach for the microphone.
Jumbo spotted at fast food in Waldshut
"Huge quantities are being worked on here," marvel the TV makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 clubs per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what quality is all about.
Most pigs are slaughtered at the age of six months.
Television at a high level?
Also details such as the Ph. value of the meat play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH value.
"I'm curious when you measure Roberto Blanco, what happens then", said Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of the private television is presented in pure culture.
But it is still worth watching.
The spectator sees that the dismantling of the clubs continues to be manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally boned on the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing Jumbo visually reminiscent of a "U-Boat".
The trick: here in the smoke, pine branches provide the special taste of Black Forest ham.
20 days in the smoke finally make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo", he announces the test.
"He is really delicious", the conclusion of the TV's star.
All those involved will be able to live with that.
You thought travel agencies are a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend.
The company has increased its full-year profit outlook and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The tour operator now anticipates a pre-tax adjusted profit of between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 million to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are met, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre posted an 8 percent profit in the first half of the year and a strong start to the second half, particularly in Australian and British private business.
"Our ten countries have been profitable since the beginning of the year and some of them are well on their way to record earnings before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest contributors.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Flight Centre ’ s leisure business in the UK was similarly doing well, while business customers here also spent less.
The U.S. business recovered compared to the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit for the full year is expected for the third consecutive year.
The shares of Flight Centre increased yesterday by 3 cents to 38.20 dollars.
Schools are being encouraged to focus more on math, spelling and grammar
In future English literature courses, pupils will have to deal with at least one play of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
"Unseen texts" are also included in the examination to encourage wider reading.
The combined English literature and language course is abolished.
From 2015, students will have to take an independent GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics - the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Examinations Authority, will announce a reorganization of GCSE ’ s structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech this summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that there is “a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence, ” stressing that GCSEs would become“ more challenging, ambitious, and rigorous. ”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year - than most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and Singapore students receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition leaders say that the comprehensive math test, combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject in rankings, will likely encourage schools to set more hours.
The curriculum places more emphasis on "real-life problems", including financial mathematics.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
At the next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the Neues Museum of the palace, the topic will be "To hell with hell - theological considerations on today's handling of the last things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parishes of Salem, Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to explore in the Forum the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries and had relied on those images of heaven and hell "which shape our ideas to this day", the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes for perfection would have been characterized more by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been duly driven out by the criticism of religion", says the speaker.
She "provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the scandal of death".
Linked to this is the question of the longing "which dreams that in the end everything will be all right".
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden, Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate (Dr. theol.) in 1997, also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelm University.
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner has held a chair for Systematic Theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleiner Heuberg confirm their profession of faith at Confirmation
In two services 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the pastoral unit Am Kleinen Heuberg were confirmed.
The divine service was attended in the morning by the group Laudato Si, and in the afternoon by the youth choir The Spirit.
In receiving the sacrament of Confirmation, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
Over the past few months, under the leadership of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous members of the congregation, the candidates for confirmation had prepared themselves for the great feast day.
In different projects they got to know different tasks of the Christian church life and experienced together the youth day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In beautiful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the circuit over the hills around the lake.
This is reported by Ulrich Knobel of the organizing sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance of 15 kilometers and 300 meters in altitude, were also numerous cyclers who wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aachen in Linz came with the recommendation good placings at the German Championships.
These two were able to get away from the field as expected.
Like last year, Felix Bader was able to save a small lead to the finish and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel again finished second.
In the women ’ s category, it was Theresa Duelli from the Nightmare team who made it to the top of the podium.
Second and third place went to Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen.
An encouraging development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race there were even more top athletes at the start this year.
Four riders managed to break away from the regional leaders.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike demi-pro from the Black ’ Tusk ’ Racing ’ Team.
Pangerl and his teammate have already won the Twelve Hours Driving World Championship twice.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Including Roland Ballerstedt, who already owns two German duathlon championships.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, it came to a lash finish in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Only one second behind the experienced Ballerstedt could secure the second place in the overall standings.
At the same time Hermann and Warthmann finished third overall.
In the women ’ s classification, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
Second place went to Areane Blersch from Binzwangen ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the Top 10 of "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to be voted "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner will receive 250,000 dollars to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father lost consciousness and travelled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation developed that spread to his brain, causing a hematoma there that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
One can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, but is not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle ’ s father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organisation, there is only one doctor in Cameroon for every 5,000 people.
In the United States, on the other hand, the ratio is that of a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.
Two in five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty, ” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffering made Bwelle decide to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and provides free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people squeeze into minibuses and drive with the tied up medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
Everything does not always run smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle - with his broad smile and his boundless energy - is happy to take part in the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team starts examining hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village - on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document that is required for school but that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening the team performs simple operations with local anaesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, a town hall or a flat; after the surgery the patients get up and go to the relaxation area to make room for their neighbour.
The lighting for the operating room and the disinfection equipment is supplied by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is an exhausting workload, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work, ” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - carried out 700 free surgeries last year and knows that its work makes a huge difference for the people it helps.
A man explained that the free hernia operation he had received now enabled him to return to work.
"That changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finances 60% of his charitable activity, so Bwelle; the remainder comes from private donations.
“I really don ’ t know when he ’ s sleeping, ” says Katie O ’ Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in Bwelles Group.
He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organisation so that he can take part in these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be involved in operations where we help to tap blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley explains.
That would never be possible in America as a second-year medical student.
Students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon and often bring medical supplies.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, the transport and the instruction.
"He is without a doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to a happier life and fulfilling a promise he made to his father gives him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I am doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellent mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the flesh by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hand in his profession, the art of acting.
Nobody can deceive the old man Santiago by fishing.
So the two complement each other just great.
One almost thinks that one can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the fisherman boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago sits on the chair, tired from life, this is real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is a character role through and through that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and finally wins the fight against the fish by his knowledge and also his strength of will.
Janson is in large parts as a solo actor on stage.
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention on himself, so that his monologues are never boring.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that the spectators forget that the sea consists only of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he sheds light on the scene in question: Santiago ’ s hut, the bar owned by the singer Marie, Luise Gunst, who sings of Cuba ’ s attitude to life with her songs and her wonderful voice.
The four musicians play Cuba ’ s rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
A sewer from the Roman era has been preserved at a length of around 120 metres below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, you can't miss the cathedral.
The two towers rise about 157 metres into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors, who marvel at the two filigree church towers, suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the Cologne underworld.
The meeting point for his tours is the Service Center of Cologne Tourismus directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground car park", says Schulze.
In the seventies the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore only that which was not too big remained of the remains of the old city walls.
Most of today ’ s users of the car park therefore hurry past the Roman remains and just park their car.
But who looks more closely, discovers in the parking deck D2 an archaeological place of discovery separated by metal lattice bars.
You can see about five meters high ruins made of palm-sized stones.
"These are remnants of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century AD," says Schulze.
Before returning to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper level of the park take a look into a dark shaft 15 meters deep.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately also hardly noticed.
The next station of the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants descend into the depths again.
Here we experience the official seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the President of the CCAA.
A visitor wants to know what CCAA means.
"The abbreviation stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium ", which in good German means" city of Roman law and city of the Agrippinensians, founded under the Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult ".
And the Praetorium is the former governor's palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
A tunnel access leads from the antechamber of the exhibition to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here at a length of around 120 metres.
"You can quietly walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze encouraged the guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After fetching the key from the cash register, he leads the group to a 16 metre deep, accessible shaft.
"We are now in the mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground in order to get the groundwater that was indispensable for the ritual ablutions.
Until today, in the lower end of the mikveh, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing gauges of the Rhine.
The mikveh will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work is due to begin shortly.
But it will take a few years to complete.
Leg almost chopped off: reissue of rocker ， process
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is rerolled after over four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily injury and damage to property against two 30 year olds has begun before the Regional Court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent at the beginning.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and to have belonged to the bandidos at that time.
The prosecution accuses them of having stabbed and beaten three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All the victims were seriously injured and one man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
This was apparently preceded by a car chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, these were turf battles and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proved that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been identified.
After appeal by the public prosecutor ’ s office, the Federal Court of Justice annulled the judgment and referred it back to the regional court for further trial.
One of the defendants is currently in open prison for another offence.
At the beginning, it was mainly about the reconstruction of the events of the crime night.
The then investigating Commissioner was invited as a witness.
The focus was on cell phone conversations between the accused and other people who had been bugged by the police.
What is difficult is that rockers almost always stick to a law of iron for them - and do not testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims was unpacked.
Public prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the public prosecutor ’ s office in Frankfurt (Oder) said when asked that new traces had appeared since the last trial.
Eleven more days have been set aside for the process.
The throwaway society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the atmosphere good, but eventually it goes home.
Except: Hunger is felt in the bellies of people sitting in the passenger seat and in the back seat.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What could be more obvious than chilling out to the next drive, to treat yourself to a little something?
I admit, I like to be there, if it goes late at night or early in the morning to get fast food.
A few fries, a coke, a burger - and then nothing like home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goers make themselves felt.
Because what does one have to miss, that one throws with constant regularity his fast-food-bags out of the car window?!
Especially on weekends there are discarded paper bags at roadsides and on parking lots.
"Why?" I ask myself.
Are the people too stupid to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It is not just that the paper stuff is spoiling the landscape.
Bags have already covered traffic facilities such as crash barriers and thus caused accidents.
But she doesn't think about such a "throwaway society", probably she doesn't even know what this word actually means.
If one is often on the road in the evening, especially with several people in the car, one knows what a back seat can look like after nights of partying: Clothes, bottles and other garbage pile up there.
There would be a few bags but more or less make up nothing - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I can already see the day coming when clearing the way becomes too stupid for the towns and municipalities - and the fast food chains have to demand a deposit for their bags.
Obama ’ s Health Policy Backslide
After strong criticism, President Obama yesterday backed down on his oft-repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
In recent days, after hundreds of thousands of their insurer received a dismissal letter, the Republicans accused the president of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep it, ” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to numerous media reports of the layoffs, Obama called on Americans who have received such notifications to look for new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could get better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or at a lower price than projected.
"They come up with a better offer," he said.
The government said it was not surprising that the five percent of the population who had taken out insurance had to look for a different tariff because their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to say directly to these Americans: they deserve better," Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
"I'm as frustrated and angry as anyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday ’ s House hearing was recorded after a dispute with Republican Representative Billy Long of Missouri over whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long repeatedly urged Sebelius to ask why the Affordable Care Act's "architect" had not voluntarily renounced state-sponsored insurance to buy a tariff from HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air base
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday to the American news channel CNN that Israeli warplanes had attacked an air base in Syrian Latakia the day before.
The target was "rockets and related equipment," which the Israeli government feared were destined for the Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
The Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab broadcaster Al ’ Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shelled during the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and blamed the Israelis for this.
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian defensive missiles of the type "S" 125 Neva and a battery of "SA" 3 rockets could be seen, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometers and can transport warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quoted an equally anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believed Israel had carried out the attack, but that he was not sure.
In any case, a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defense said, "We are not commenting on these reports."
In the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, journalist Ron Ben ’ s Yishai stressed that the Syrian regime had previously attempted, in part successfully, to deliver ground air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any Syrian attempt to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a "red line" followed by a military response.
John Kerry states in an unprecedented admission that US espionage "went unreasonably too far"
With an unexpected admission, John Kerry hinted at a softening of the US ’ s defensive stance over its surveillance programs, saying that in certain cases, espionage had “gone unreasonably too far. ”
The foreign minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were jointly responsible for switching to “autopilot ” when the whistleblower Edward Snowden ’ s explosive revelations about NSA espionage became public.
Leaked information has plunged the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
In a video-taped speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the President and I, and others in the government, have learned of some things that have happened quasi by autopilot, simply because the capacity existed to do what goes back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course 11 September."
Subsequently, he was the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases this has gone unreasonably too far'.
The President is determined to provide clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that this is an abuse.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process.
But Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force for good, and that many lives had been saved by its surveillance.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is bent on killing, blowing up, and attacking governments.
So what if we were able to intercept and stop it before it happened?
We actually prevented airplane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we learned of such plans beforehand.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to allay concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US on anti-terror efforts, the chairman of the Senate European Affairs Subcommittee said on Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terror organizations due to frustration with the National Security Agency ’ s monitoring.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans remain on board in our joint efforts against terrorism," Murphy, a first-time Democrat in the Senate and Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of phone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of intelligence said this week that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO ’ s allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from Snowden documents that the NSA monitored the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state around the world.
The head of the national secret services, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and stated that this was common practice on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said his agency was preparing for the Congressional trip to be held this year, hoping that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary would be worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words".
He said that European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes they themselves have been using for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also come to terms with the fact that we are not the only spies," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is scheduled for a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to confront resentment over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
A stubborn ankle injury threatens to prevent the deployment of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga, the away game of FSV Mainz 05 with FC Augsburg.
Mainz calls for an engagement of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far he could only do this individually.
"We will decide on his use at short notice", said Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goal scorer with six goals.
Because the Mainzer must do already without the hurt achievement carriers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman appeals against imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty of false testimony by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June after she told the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday 10 June, while two other men detained her.
Later, however, a video camera showed that she had arrived safely at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to having fabricated the story.
She was in police custody on the spot until the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player in the Australian Rubgy ’ s league, who turned to the Canberra State Department for help with his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
"Of course we are very worried, but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed the verdict and is at large on bail of 50,000 baht.
Australian reports said that in the meantime she is on holiday in the holiday resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court said that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, following the recent murder of the travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, might try to improve its tarnished tourist image and therefore be acquitted.
