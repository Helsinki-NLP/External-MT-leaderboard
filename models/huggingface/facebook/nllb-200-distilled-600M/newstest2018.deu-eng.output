Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A madhouse where young people meet.
A graveyard chapel where they're now digging for the subway tunnel.
Small gardeners are maintaining the old farming land.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
Anyone who's ever had to get upset about that knows that because the auto-navi was showing a green lawn instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian atlas, an offer from the Bavarian government's geoportal, are far from current - but very informative.
Especially when you compare them to current online maps.
It then becomes clear how cities and communities in the Munich Mercury area have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavarian atlas is a rug that is not immediately recognized as such.
The large overview map incorporated more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, called urposition sheets.
These were created according to the Bavarian survey administration between 1810 and 1864 and stem from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client is Napoleon.
The French army commander occupied Bavaria from the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the Peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, it was the neighbors of today who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map.
Crown Prince Max IV Joseph carried the project forward, founding the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Investigation Administration.
The Munich Urposition is from 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the Bavarian State Library website.
The comparison between the past and the present is most impressive in the example of the capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is the sub-sendling, which appears in the 1856 map still relatively isolated.
Sendling was incorporated as a borough of Munich 21 years after the map was drawn up, in 1877.
Today, the underground is in the middle of the city.
The houses of the Unterendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance, when you zoom in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-numbered floors from the so-called "grabbing", from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots of land are no longer occupied by farmers - they are occupied by small gardeners of the Land in the Sun.
A large green area is drawn north of Subendling.
The Theresienweide, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually a weed in the 19th century - not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives a glimpse into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the opening page of the newspaper, in the territory of the present-day district of Au-Haidhausen, the street name is not only "am Gasteig" or "On the Airs" - but also "Irren Anstalten" in large letters.
Yes, on Auerfeldstraße, people with delusions were once locked up.
In 1858/59 the Munich Circle of the "Auf der Uhr Luft" (On the Hours of the Wind) was founded.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institute - the psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Louis II.
"He was progressive for his time, ending, for example, the chain of so-called fools.
He also prohibited the use of force against the inmates", says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, which has been working with the institute for an exhibition.
Initially, 280 patients could be accommodated, but later it was expanded to 500.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Circular Centre in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost has been located there, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Germany.
On the grounds of the former Auer Anstalts, young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
To the west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, to the east are 1980s residential buildings.
In 2015, the children's home "Casa Don Bosco" was built - based on the original construction of the insane asylum, which was destroyed by bombing during World War II.
The Marienplatz was registered as "Main Platz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.
Allied bombs in December 1944 tore many holes in the city center.
One big one stayed until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval tomb chapel once stood at Marienhof, where the preparatory work and the spat staging for the second S-Bahn main line take place on 5 April 2017.
The slide controller can compare the old Munich map with today's aerial view - and fill the hole at Marienhof.
Civil Rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning for people of color who travel to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is scheduled to take effect on August 28, 2017, urges African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to exercise special caution and extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable racial-based incidents have recently occurred and are being noted throughout the state", the group said in a statement.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as state law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have civil rights violations that people are going through.
They're being stopped because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed", Missouri NAACP president Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such frequency as we have never heard before".
It's the first such warning the organization has issued to a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racial abuse against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas during his trip across the state and being taken into custody by Missouri State Police without charge of a crime.
The council also points to a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office that shows black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites in the state.
"The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri", Chapel said.
"People must be prepared to bring bail or let their relatives know they're traveling through the state".
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranks the state 16th in the nation in terms of the number of such crimes.
The travel advisory is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently, interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
The grazing project is elementary
The Fischerbacher grazing fence project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU's deputy Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have made a name for themselves on the ground.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Local Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of grassland and 40 hectares of forest, provides for 40 dairy cows and as many young animals, and accommodates holidaymakers in five apartments.
The "black forest milk" is for him the alternative way to market the milk of his cows, Schwendemann said.
The table for holiday guests is exclusively regional.
As he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he described the grazing project as "essential".
I can't afford to do business on such steep terrain.
The green space is a lot of work, and much of it has to be worked with the motor sense.
"We have to deal with the conditions and the topography here", emphasized Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over the parent company and operated it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he does not operate organically.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognised the importance of the grazing project and is pleased with Leader support".
The Commission has already decided to extend the aid to the farmers.
It is hoped that this will allow for the further extension of the forestry of the area.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and worry about how they will carry on their farm", the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticized for supporting the
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of 11 participants were fenced in the pasture fence.
The area of the open holdings is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of EUR 71 500, half were financed by Leader, with a quarter borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
The farmers thus had to invest 12,610 euros in 16.2 km of grazing.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences", explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers women, it cannot be done".
Peter White also said: "The best food is produced here".
The Landscape Protection Directive (LPR) of Baden-Württemberg allows the state to support grazing fences.
The objective is to keep the Black Forest open.
The requirement is that there is a supporting background designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be manageable by tractor (inclination above 35%) and must therefore be threatened by deforestation.
The Fischerbacher grazing fence project 2018 is currently undergoing the application of eight participants with 24 plots who want to build a fence of almost 16 kilometres.
The area of the open space is 35 hectares, the estimated cost is more than 112 000 euros.
Nothing is sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty
The most sure sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein in Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN over the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had.
But he addressed its significance, and in particular the significance attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its foundation in 1903, 17 years after the memorial was completed.
As Miller slandered Acosta, "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you're referring to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty".
Miller is right, but as he put it, it's not really about history.
It is a contemporary echo of Lazarus's stirring words, the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants but the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigue, your poverty, your distressed masses who long to breathe freely, the miserable waste of your rich coasts".
There was never a time when the "poor waste" was better visible on our screens.
Miller didn't engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's United States.
This conflict over the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict over the significance of America.
Lazarus and her friends, who were committed to putting their words on the ground after her death, knew very well that they were committing a high-level political act.
The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the poem: the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the Exiled.
The poem's connection to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativity.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers have long wanted to change that.
The great trumpetist Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for Trump's coming, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative that brought the American flame into the night world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
She's supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not light the way to the United States".
It's rather unusual that Limbaugh came across something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of perception.
Lazarus' great imaginative act was to see her as she was seen by the tired, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often dreadful journeys on the decks of ships.
It's really about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And that's not the perspective Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch should not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black congratulates Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were in the British team.
The UK's athletics director, Neil Black, says the 16-man Scottish squad in the World Cup squad will "contribute massively to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that the sport of athletics in the United Kingdom needs to learn from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we'll continue to do so until we find out", Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And the guy on the corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant".
Several of the Scottish athletes are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team as team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Your captain's speech was incredible", says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether Scottish or wherever they live or train, left the room feeling very proud and very motivated.
The passion and real feeling Eilidh brought naturally was great".
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in her fifth world championships in the 400m hurdles, says it's "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's highest total number of athletes at the World Cup so far was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle distance runner Muir is leading this way, setting five British and two European records last year.
She will be competing in the 1,500m and 5,000m events.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another Scottish man to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers their first world championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "very proud" that many of her countrymen will not only be part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other team members, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me", she added.
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she did well.
I just pointed out that we're very happy in this situation, because we have a home world championship.
So it's really important to rely on this home support and to take advantage of being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there".
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand the excitement of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He was a critic, I'm sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away, and, stupid and mute, we're being led to the slaughter like sheep".
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week for that.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was filled with a backlash with, "Well, what?"
"It's just Facebook", many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval rating among the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and to debut his hairless head after chemotherapy on his page.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum, which is officially called, and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people whipping online.
The mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his mail and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she was asking about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other news", she wrote in the comment section of The Post.
"I also disapprove of this idea, if a number of people take a stand on the same issue, then they are more likely to be disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of concerned citizens".
What the governor's staff called a "focused spam attack" would likely be called "primitive language".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than in the past, if you'd done the same thing, sending staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally right now.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for slandering Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this matter came in Virginia last week.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she removed a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers joined his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius", and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that were downplaying Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Nordire, who led the side to the final last year at Archerfield Links before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance Club built, and we're seeing it achieve its glory with this event", said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from its best side, it's in great shape.
Jerry did a great job setting up this place.
He's a passionate advocate of this game and proud of his accomplishments here.
This is a great window for this course".
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special", said the Southport-based player.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
It's magical to come back to this part of the world.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories of last year come back, and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish".
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home", said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played solid golf.
I'm glad it went this far".
With the trio on the field, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, parking costs £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.

Less deaths from lung cancer from passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer people have died of lung cancer from secondhand smoke.
This is the conclusion of a study by scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"We estimate that passive smoking is responsible for 167 lung cancer deaths a year", said study director Heiko Becher.
He used his own study on this subject in 1994 as a comparison.
At the time, there were 400 deaths from lung cancer per year in Germany due to secondhand smoke.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
The main problem is that the
The construction work on Villinger Street is in full swing and "is somewhat out of time", says Fred Heinze, head of the construction site.
The situation in the area of housing connections is more complicated than expected, as much is hidden underground which is not mentioned in the plans.
The traffic which is constantly hindering the construction works is a major problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of motorists in front of red lights and barricades is already enormous", reports Heinze.
The road is blocked and only buses are allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite exhausting.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt provided us with cool mineral water", says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called a "note" - right in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred lump is removed and swallowed with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, such as washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m"., she says.
It is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was incorporated in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia when only 1,026 elders were to vote in public hand-pollination before the occupying forces.
An existing movement that was fighting for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is boring, and the trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to Nabire, followed by a 5-hour rental car ride each morning.
There is no public transportation.
The city of about 19,000 people is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and wavy roofs that have been rusted to various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes", says Degei, pointing to her vibrant hand-woven turban, her dark shirt, and her bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies".
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28 percent of the population living below the poverty line and some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold country.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated US$78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papuan people, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 New York Times investigation reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papua's demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden geese and are treated mercilessly.
Activists say more than 500,000 Papuan people have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in the Papuan tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We're gonna lose everything", says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities from the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electrocution are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week", says Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been strengthened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the densely populated islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a vegetable mixed with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to stay here.
"Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables at a lower price than the local Papuan market", explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to work.
"It cost the native Papuan - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - their market".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, pledged to address inequalities and violations of the law in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's 29 counties - including Paniai - en route to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, expecting him to fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored", You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out singing Christmas carols in front of a camp fire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking, chasing and hitting the group with their rifle bullets, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field outside the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird's song - of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military posts.
As the mood picked up, the soldiers received an order from an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, shoot them to death", says an official TIME document that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was shot in my left wrist", he told TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but he says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired", he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, has only one name, to TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him".
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted their station "safe" because it was being attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us", said Papua Police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death".
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings was not "filtered" to Jakarta until the next day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the victims' families and vowing to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case resolved immediately so that it will not happen again in the future", he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he was establishing an extrajudicial mechanism to remedy historic human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries have been reported long ago.
Some were in the '90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to be done", he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "everything is regulated by law".
Wiranto, who was charged by the UN for "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the Paniai victims responded to such claims with gross disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress", says Yohanes.
"I'm tired. I'm tired".
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm scared", he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot".
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military came looking for me", he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in the Deiyai neighborhood of Pania.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take a man unconscious to hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested outside the company's local office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we were afraid of revenge", says Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the rapidly-arriving of the injured, according to TIME.
"I hid in my house for two days".
The Deiyai Parliament called for the officers involved to be held accountable and the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is compounding the discontent of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua's rights by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years under the pretext of "protecting national sovereignty".
Some never show up.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty increases discontent.
The little rice that's sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat, especially nutmeg and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women, who can each cultivate four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the crop for the family, while the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten notes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the native Papuan population and the new migrants have grown, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs in the region are usually for the better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or skills to run its own companies competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here", says John Gobai, the chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite the rare permission to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, said Jokowi's campaign promises to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development had not been fulfilled.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a blacklist", he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "different and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has a democratic system and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence for human rights cases".
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and pressured him to "We want freedom", according to a source who was also present at the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuan people say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings", says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor educational and health care.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuan people, see their vote for Jokowi as a "guilt" that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice", he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shootings carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they don't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed", Yacobus says, his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Fire seizes Dubai's 'torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-high 79-story building.
It's the second fire to sweep through the tower in just two years, which is also known as the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the blaze.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the screams of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor", one resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire around 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide accommodation for the victims.
The incident may raise questions about the safety of materials used in the outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building following its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage was caused by the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe that the system of insulation and disguise plates at the Grenfell Tower in London in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup reform: Best of five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed at the General Assembly with his big Davis Cup coup.
At the Ho Chi Minh City meeting, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles on two winning odds was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long but very much appreciated, remain the traditional ones.
63.54 per cent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was almost missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire Davis Cup and Fed Cup reform package.
We need change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions", Haggerty said.
The Commission will continue to work to improve applications.
The Commission has already proposed that the final be held in a neutral place.
From 2018 onwards, only comparatively small details are available: the finalists of the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup will have the right to host the first round the following year.
To reduce the costs for the organisers, training venue requirements will be eased, etc. and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring prohibited items on a plane, a survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1 percent said they were late to discover that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying objects with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men also confirmed that they deliberately brought prohibited drugs into the plane.
The company said it surveyed travelers across the country to find out how many had accidentally smuggled goods through airport security and how many had done so deliberately.
It is no surprise that the people who were most likely to carry smuggled goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were the ones who flew the most frequently.
The company notes, however, that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure of what liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might consider books smuggled.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care, tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel their orders.
Electro-millennialist Elon Musk likes to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3"
It has thus far refused to state that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant sales figures and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet, first revealed another, less glamorous figure: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk had been promoting the new car in recent months with more than 500,000 pre-orders, and it's just starting to ship.
Now Musk admits that out of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these were only non-binding reservations.
In the event of cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 euro (US$1000 and UK £1000) "reservation payment" in full.
There are currently 455,000 such nonbinding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
But the Tesla boss doesn't believe that cancelling about 12 percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument: the challenge to the ambitious growth targets is not on the demand side, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, all models combined, it's expected to be 500,000, and in 2020, one million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.
If you order a Model 3 today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production roads, never tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum capacity.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are any major delays, then the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can't stop dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPA chief Pruitt is retiring because of the delay in Obama-era emissions reduction rules
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous position in a Federal appeals court.
It is a deadline that expires on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his agency more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a credible opponent of stricter environmental laws.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority in trying to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards simply strengthen the EPA's willingness to work with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then waited for it to be indicted by activist groups and others and to set a deadline for implementation in an agreement", said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in judicial regulation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that we have seriously".
However, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt will eventually use its 'delaying power and all other legally available powers' to ensure that the rules are 'based on sound policy and the best available information'.
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - according to our lawsuits - is a major gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that is pouring into their communities", Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe", said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological crusade of the Trump administration, offering ourselves to environmental polluters and their special interests".
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius' Church: On the occasion of the jubilee of the mountain church, a serenade is being held in the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius site is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made friends and supporters of the tumult their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village village god".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergist document book: Count Hermann of Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
According to the text of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a royal court on the Tumlinger mountain, to which the church or the right of patronage belonged and not the other way around.
So people lived there too.
As the description of the Freudenstadt Upper Office of 1858 shows, next to the Lower Town and Upper Town, which are still visible today in the local image of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the dominant settlement core of the village.
Old maps dating from about 1600 confirm these historical facts.
Patriotic law was born out of the early medieval law of the church.
A man who built a church, equipped it and had a priest remained the owner of that church and could also inherit that church.
This included the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The older of the two broke up at Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell rang for the first time in 1692, but later had to be dropped in 1942 during World War II.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the windows were broken and the bell parts stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops were camped near the church.
They tore the chapel and church chairs out and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from hearing loss.
In 1823, the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm tore the church tower apart and half of it collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower-dwarf that still stands today has survived as a witness to 750 years of church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Creative Retirees" are the successors of Dieter Dockhorn, who maintain the Hilarius plant.
As the organisers, the friends and supporters of the Tumlingens invite the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery on Sunday, July 16, to the St. Hilarius Chapel.
It is designed by the Kepler Gymnasium Combo Freudenstadt and features contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Mayor Brave Romann is the final word.
The program starts at 4:30.
Check-in is from 3:30.
To celebrate the serenade, a drink is held outside the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening in the shade of old trees and with a wide view of the forest over meadows", the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The serena only takes place in dry weather.
The organisers hope to have many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius site, which is important to the tumlings and hearing impaired.
The friends and supporters of the tumlings feel a special commitment to home care, as Walter Martini, the organizer of the Serenade, confirms.
The Association wants to have wind turbine approval checked
Boisheim defends itself, which does not see a legal requirement for the construction, has therefore appealed to the Land Council.
The Boisheim Defends Association has asked Land Council President Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Net.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 no wind power plants could have been approved in Boisheimer Nette, since at that time there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border with Schwalmtal in Viersen.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but the concentration zone excludes wind energy use for the rest of the urban area.
These zones are designed to prevent "savings" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind energy concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan, but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a fault in the form.
"The lack of planning legislation makes the authorisation decision still illegal and therefore withdrawal", said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of Boisheim defends itself.
The current situation: the city council has decided once again before the summer break on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: 'This makes the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines at this point of time legally excluded from planning.'
The circle confirms receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received from the Viersen district since last week", a spokesman explained.
The circle takes her as an opportunity to reconsider the matter.
But they are not likely to stop the proceedings.
In view of the ongoing proceedings before the Administrative Court, the Circuit refused to comment on the arguments of the Boisheim defends association on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four wind turbines at a site on the Boisheimer Nette.
The company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had already entered into leases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land last year.
The four wind turbines are designed to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households, or about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
NEW Re is planning to invest some 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor collide: Woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Circle).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich drove her car with her 53-year-old mother as an escort towards Bogel.
City and merchants plan home shopping weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade union and the city government want to use the weekend of September 8 and 9 to lure the residents into the city centre to shop.
As the trade union's president, Christian König, announced, the "home shop" weekend is to raise awareness among customers about the offers the city has outside the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies are expected to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the city centre shops are invited to "midnight shopping".
The aim of the action is not only to the residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation, there will be radio commercials, an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, says Christian König.
The city administration and trade unions cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The trade union and the city are thus entering a new phase of the attractive inner city project.
These include new offers such as the first 'active day' of the Fountain Festival, including an open Sunday, discussions with all operators and hosts to encourage them to take part.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the exemption from parking fees on that day are part of the concept.
The Commission will also consider the possibility of re-exploiting customer potential.
This includes cooks and tourists.
But many locals would have lost sight of the downtown area when they were shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help revive the downtown area - from landlords to businesses throughout the city and clubs.
The use of a network is essential to overcome the lethargy that has been partly widespread, King said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Centre in Mühlhausen, said that for the first time five Thuringia cities will participate in the third national "Home Shop" day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Holy City and Bleicherode.
The aim of the day is to "promote the appreciation of local trade and to highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", says Streich.
The action, led by the IHK and with many partners, also makes clear that each citizen can influence his own direct environment through his or her buying behaviour.
Two dead and several injured in a school explosion in the US
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them seriously.
According to the fire department, one injured person was in critical condition on Wednesday.
One person died when a part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A first missing person was later found dead.
The dead were school employees.
As an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and asked him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president slandered him for publicly denouncing the wall, and reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press that".
Trump began his presidential campaign with the promise of building a wall on the southern border of the United States and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. to take in refugees who migrated to Australia was "ridiculous", "miles" and "stupid" and that insisting on the trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "depp" after he proposed a ban on relocating refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call of the day".
Moores Ford massacre: activists re-enact racist lynchings as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury was driving through a crowd of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rammed to the Ford Bridge in Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles came out to block its way.
The mob leader - a middle-aged man in a needle-stripped suit - took a long train to his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n----r Roger!" cried the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams broke the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene that was filmed on July 22 is just a reenactment.
But then when Roger throws a snare around his neck, almost everyone in the audience sighs out.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge to emulate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one's ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really incredible that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are", said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the re-enactment.
"It's a dirty stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls".
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman from the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights advocate.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and is an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice", he said.
"We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice".
A coroner's office puts a bedspread over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching trial.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motivation for the lynchings has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote in the summer primary for the first time.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight allegedly over a woman.
Brooks said there was a rumor in town that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying wasn't her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But then as they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, Harrison was the one who prepared and ordered the murders", concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local law enforcement, which was not only involved in the murders, but also eliminated evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses".
Brooks is even more articulate.
"It was a voting rights massacre", he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community, "If you register and vote, this is what will happen to you".
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual reenactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is clear, gripping, and rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to look, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching, because then we're all going to be confronted with its ugliness in us", she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to hear me or what I've been through".
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - rushed into a room and listened as Greene began a well-recorded review of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is here as Greene's co-director.
He's been playing the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that", Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to those times".
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm yelling at Hester and pressing him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get off my property!"
Rascona is responding to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) starts laughing.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!", asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No", said Greene, still gazing.
"I just don't think white people said 'n--he' back then".
"But", one of the other black actors joked.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.' "
And that's when the energy shifts in the room, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone's busy getting this right, not just for the game, but for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
No one is laughing.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There's screaming, shooting, and then there's silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands over the actor's body and delivers Billie Holidays mourning "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred yards behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple from Ithaca, New York, came to see the show, many just come down the street.
They've all experienced Georgia's pressing humidity for nearly eight hours as Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the Malcoms and Dorsey cemeteries.
Up until that point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now that you're standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels ghostly.
When the last notes of the song are played, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body.
Children hook their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead", murmurs a little boy, as if to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd and it's over.
The actors throw the lynch rope away and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow performers and then breaks into their arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay", one of the women whispered.
"We know that's not in your heart.
You did this for a reason".
Later, the audience will gather with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta is excited to chat about the replay with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find the words to describe the feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... come from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you", she said.
"What this really does to me is make me believe that the lynching is still going on", she added, "today it's just called police shooting".
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks keeps court at his table, eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he's already started planning the show next year.
"The play is in a way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning", he said.
"It's like, if we don't learn anything from it, it can happen again.
He who does not study his own history, he who does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it".
"God's Dawn" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf uses a colorful, frivolous staging of a gigantic six-story set.
The set (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shallow street corner including the remains of the Berlin Wall and the Dönerbude, a "plastic and elastic" logo from the GDR or the New York Stock Exchange.
There's an open Mercedes watch in front of it, where the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil jars remind us of Castor's motto - money, power and greed - drawn by his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in "Rheingold".
They seduce Siegfried, drag a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood fashion and give the Krawallo clip.
Stephen Milling sings the beautifully ugly garden surrounded by the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he slays Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Mark Oak) will have to believe it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with a loud applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are being stormyly celebrated, humbly bowing their hands to the Merkel roots.
There is a big applause for the party orchestra, which is appearing on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat, in light leisure clothing.
Frank Castorf and his directing team were eagerly awaited.
If he had to have a live concert in 2013, five years later there was a big celebration, when the individual "Buh" shouts died.
Festival director Katharina Wagner must have been thrilled.
"You can see that the audience has grown up with the ring in some way", she had said just before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only made some kind of peace with Castorf, but it also grew an understanding of his viewpoint.
I'm taking a positive résumé.
Max Menge is volunteering
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where?
Usually in Steinfurt, in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven, in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working full-time at school.
What's your experience with this?
It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 now, so you're a late-stage volunteer.
How come?
I graduated high school.
And then, let's say, a civil engineering degree, successfully completed.
I realized for myself that it was the wrong thing to do and I wanted to do something different, work with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
Take a social year, there's a glimpse of what it's like on the ground, maybe even at the focal point.
And that's what happened?
I've got some great impressions.
I'm going to start my studies in social work in the winter semester.
I'll study dual, probably do a social work training at the Youth Office of Herne and study at the Hamm Technical University.
Is it not unusual to have several different types of volunteer service?
Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from old age home to youth work - in all facets of social work.
I was very varied.
I was also part of the OGS, which means afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what got me excited.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really went.
Unlike in civil engineering?
Okay, well, this isn't about calculating static.
You keep having other people in front of you, and they're all having a different story.
Whether it is a refugee or a young person who has been taken out of the family, we must always take individual action.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fear of touch?
I'm not the type to do that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are negative moments, but that's life.
Pearson is cutting another 3,000 jobs and cutting dividends to revive business.
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its dividends by 72 percent as another restructuring programme was launched to overcome the pressure the company was facing.
The job cuts, which were announced by CEO John Fallon for the majority of the year, will be announced at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, in addition to the previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced a third cost-cutting programme in May, a cost-cutting plan of another £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which last month sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann, said the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged after growing 1% to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, a NATO statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports also claimed the lives of three civilians in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest act of violence that Afghanistan has seen this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised bomb carried by persons".
The statement said all the wounded were in stable condition and were being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilian deaths were recorded in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people in the country's deadliest militant attack since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs increasing the number of US troops supporting the country's military and police.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPO reverses its decision to delay the Smog rule following complaints against the
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has rescinded a decision to delay a regulation by the Obama administration that states are required to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to push forward the so-called 'Ozone Regulation 2015' and said it demonstrated the Agency's commitment to cooperate with States.
"We believe in dialogue and in responding to our government partners", said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June that the EPA intended to delay the ozone regulations - which measure pollutant emissions in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, including the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has tried to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says is designed to boost economic growth.
However, the efforts have led to a backlash from Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the impact of higher emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says that breathing in air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
The Council wants community space
The decision was finally clear: the Municipality of Fluorn-Winzeln decided, by two votes to none, to set up a community centre in the future senior living centre.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the remaining part of the land has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
While it will take some time for the land that has been owned by the church community to become the property of the community, there is no longer any planning obstacle to the project being approved by a private investor.
We are discussing a Community area.
One of the two investors still on the boat offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space at a special price.
The administration and the majority of the council intend to provide such a community space not only as a meeting place for residents of senior living, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "trick cafe" was used.
The decision, which was taken in advance last autumn to provide funds for the current budget, is being sweetened by funding options.
The building is in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a Community area would be eligible, Tjaden reports, at 60 percent to 30 percent.
The proposal for a decision, which aims to signal to the investor that he does not want to be thrown in the middle of the road, provides that both saddle roofs - which are based on environmental improvements - and deck roofs - which reduce grape height and make construction more economical - are possible.
It is not only Wilfried Sohmer who thinks that this addition is unnecessary.
If it helps, he'll pass the committee unanimously.
It's not that easy in the community room.
Daniela Ruf points to the many buildings of her own that are not as good for you, for which you now lean out the window in the community room.
Yvonne Staiger is a strong supporter of the Community area, but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees a hidden subsidy to wealthy investors or even foreign investors.
The Commission has not yet decided on the basis of the present proposal.
Staiger's proposal to split the resolution accordingly has three supporters.
So, two votes against the original plan, which Stefan Haller summarizes: "If we make the decision this way, we're taking a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Car collision: cyclist hit by road
On Wednesday, an 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car in Garath and seriously injured.
According to police, Langenfelder, 82, was on his bicycle at 12.20 p.m. on the Black Road bike path coming from Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the highway at the top of the road at Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
But when the long-distance tractor took to the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic.
He crashed into a car driven by a 66-year-old Hilden woman.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital in a life-saving van.
Bayern Munich must give up David Alaba and Thiago in the Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup will be held without him.
With staff concerns, FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season.
Seven pro's missing the Super Cup champion's title-defender.
The staff worries at German football record-breaking Bayern Munich are increasingly high ahead of the Supercup on Saturday (20:30 GMT/ZDF and Eurosport) at the cup-winning Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti must also give up David Alaba in the BVB duel.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to ensure that the Member States are able to take account of the situation in the Member States.
For the five defeats in the last six Tests, Ancelotti has blamed his team's physical condition and lack of balance in the game.
"We know we are not in the best physical condition", Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good last time".
But the 58-year-old believes in a performance boost in the first official game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team's ready.
We want to play smart", said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel between the two German heavyweights is drawing fans to their senses.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) said on Friday.
Walk in the resin of stars
The first national "star trail" is to be built in resin.
This is the plan of the St. Andreasberg Observatory.
There's been a planetary path in Göttingen since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and sporting performance.
Members want to set up signs along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase by 2018, the association plans "well-reachable installations in five to six locations" in Upper Harz.
Inquiry was conducted in St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeis and Sieber.
The information on the boards is to be supplemented by the Internet.
Therefore, good reception of the mobile network plays a role in the selection of the location.
The Commission has also proposed that the Community should be able to take measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not compromised.
Later, the Star Trek will be extended by train.
"On the path of the stars, observers learn a lot of interesting things, such as the physics of individual stars", the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines brighter than another, even though it is farther away.
It also indicates which constellation a selected star is in and when it is best to see it.
The association has been operating the highest stargazing station in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The location in the middle of the National Park of Harz is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Conservation.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy can often be seen with the naked eye.
The University City has been the home of something similar to the planned galaxy - the Planetary Way - since 2003, at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen.
Starting from Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its stars leads up to the Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (a community of similarities) with the planet Sedna.
The stars with the individual planets - including the dwarf planet Pluto at the endpoint - are exactly one to two billion in distance and scale.
The earth shrinks to a ball 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planet's path is about four kilometers.
While sunlight takes about eight hours to reach Pluto, pedestrians take a good hour to reach the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were scheduled to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super lightweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-division world champion Adrian Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you luck".
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7pm on Saturday night.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I'm a former featherweight", Garcia recalled.
"I've climbed to 140 pounds for Broner, but I'm not that tall.
I'm small for 140.
I want to lose weight.
And he needs to move on lightweight and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this".
Lomachenko agreed with me.
"Boxing needs this fight".
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy Lomachenko must battle with with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in fighting winner Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could be in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have been asking for it", Garcia said, later voicing his candor to fight for the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they 're ready ... "
Garcia said he values Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter", and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped giving Garcia the generous compliment and said he thought the three-way champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-out".
Garcia said the focus was on showing strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be fought.
No other fight generates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to be working on it", Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight".
Four injured after tyre patch
Four people were seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at about 16:30 just outside the market gate, presumably after a tire patch.
The car slid right into the trench, where it overturned and then lay on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During the first rescue service's first aid to the injured, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, after which traffic on the left lane could be diverted to the scene.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-chain is better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2-2 start to the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation will bring Aue points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, and the result was also satisfied if the two opponents had not been in the 2-2 draw against Braunschweig.
"That was two goals too many, and we have to be even more careful in Aue", says the Fortuna Düsseldorf defender.
The three-way chain is also to be further optimized in the Erzgebirge.
And a goal after a free kick, the fortunes won't be able to catch up.
"For the future, no one will stand up to Michael [Rensing]".
Hoffmann is convinced that his team, even after the experience in preparation, will be better at using the three-chain than the four-chain.
"I don't know how we're going to play in Aue yet", said his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players in the three-man chain right now in the half positions at Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build up well", Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is that we harmonize even better and that we do not make so many errors in the structure".
Of course, Hoffmann is going to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk about a failed start after a draw, I don't know.
The performance might be fine", Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand with four points on Sunday and focus on the Cup, we can certainly talk about a decent start to the season".
His coach didn't want to know about it.
"I don't judge the start of the season until after six to eight days", said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue, just because the Saxon game in Heidenheim had to be cancelled early because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season with a home game", Funkel said, and Hoffmann believes that the Aue players might even be a little fresher, as they don't have a hard and complete game like Fortuna against a climbing favorite in their bones.
"But they don't know where they are at the moment", says Fortuna's interior minister.
The guests from the Rhineland will go as a light favorite on Sunday to the final (almost) finished Aue stadium.
"It's stupid to take them out just because we're in the top six", says Funkel, whose score is quite positive in just one loss to Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start", explains Fortunas' head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant".
And that's exactly how Spark doesn't want his players to experience Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests published
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are over 18. But not everyone believes the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started conducting the tests last year.
They are to make the age assessment more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationverket) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age".
The tests shall be carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics from the past few months, the numbers are pretty consistent", he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases where the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person being tested was 18 years of age or older".
When the Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that he would be 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which uses X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints and is then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
One skeptic is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think that kind of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can", he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is if the person is under 18, in which case it is about 10 percent".
Full plan
The work on the three bridges on Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance to Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it is going great", says Reinhold Leicht, head of construction at the Freiburg government office's road and transport department.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
Construction is scheduled to end in October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be followed.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, crosses the drum arch.
It is a concrete arch bridge, covered with red colored sandstone, with a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come of age.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They're made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance to the town of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 m wide and seven tonne-weight bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a fence that is also used as a working road.
A 2.20 metre wide bridge cap will be installed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
Then the footpath should run along it.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent from the Schramber company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The construction of the building in Lauterbach required a special sense of touch.
Because there's a fiber optic cable that many companies are connected to.
The residents were informed of the project by means of leaflets prior to the work.
In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the construction yard and the collector's yard in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is strictly regulated by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely blocked.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is 700 000 euros.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter protest at German potato salad
It is not so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under one hat.
The parties represented at Volkaneifel's Circular Day (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that peacefully flags the day because the AfD is inviting Rondell to the "big election campaign event" in Gerolsteiner Stadthalle.
And it brings to the fore famous names like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland will form the leading duo for the Bundestag elections on September 24th, and the deputy federal chairwoman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on the scene hours before the event begins don't want to listen to the AfD students, they want to demonstrate.
The motto is "The Eifel stays colorful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the slogan "All at one table" on the Fountain Square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the round - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that shows itself.
And what Christa Karoli, chairwoman of the One World Forum and one of the key organizers, is really happy about: "It's amazing how many people have gathered here".
There's music and plenty of food, including a "German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat", says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, and they are present at the station, which is only a few metres from the venue.
How did the AfD get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcano Niel reports that he tried to have such an event and got the bonus.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially applied in Daun, but was rejected because there were not enough parking spaces because of the Laurentian skirmishes already built.
So the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a beautiful event here".
Looking at the event in the Rondell square, he says, "This is the good right of the people, mainly, it stays peaceful".
It does this too: around 8 p.m. a band will be presenting in the Rondell square, where several speakers will be present, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 people in the audience waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag, Alice Weidel, and the deputy chairwoman Beatrix von Storch to deliver their speeches.
The police presence remains unchanged, but until now the officers have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little over an hour, guests in the front yard take a longer breath, but there's also a clean-up call shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can withdraw - no special events.
Trumpet is blowing
A reunion with Wolf trumpeter Frederic Belli will be held in the Haslacher Convent concert series tomorrow, Sunday, at 8pm in the convent church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkan folklore" meets a classic German education with roots in wind music.
Both soloists have won and won numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in leading European orchestras.
Petkov is the solo trumpet player of the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the solo trumpet player of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both are united by the desire not only to transcend the boundaries of their instruments but also to blend the boundaries of their different genres.
So Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new dress to the two, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" joins Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazz award winner Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free play blend into a fascinating work of art.
This core programme was launched with great success in Freiburg this spring.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more: the Hasla monastery church is consciously involved in the concert with its special acoustics.
Kristen Stewart is talking about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives.
But I want to try everything", says Kristen Stewart openly about her bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?'"
The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was with her Twilight colleague Robert Pattinson, who ended up breaking up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?"
After their divorce, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
So it's never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously".
She suffered particularly from it, but in school, when she dressed like a bub, she said: "Not all girls are typical girls.
It really hurt me.
When I was 11, the kids told me I'd look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, scared, and embarrassed.
Now I look back and think, 'Girl, be proud of yourself!'"
She is particularly reluctant to explain her love life to the public: "People expect you to behave in a certain way, and that annoys me.
And some may call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself in front of the whole public".
The governor of West Virginia announces he's changing the party
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would be changing the party.
Like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me", said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a Democratic governor".
The rally broke out in cheers.
"Tomorrow I'm going to change my registration to the Republicans", Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game".
Mr. Trump had previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice didn't approve of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who Forbes says is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying, "The change of Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather stop us than work to make our country great again".
"With only 15 governments and the control of the fewest legislatures in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is just the last rejection of a party that is top-down leaderless and unable to find a positive, consistent message", RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News in a statement.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
World head of athletics Sebastian Coe praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious Russian apology for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be re-admitted to the sport.
Russia's head of athletics, Dmitry Shylakhtin, said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he felt sorry for "all the athletes who were stripped of gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation", IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized for itself that it has been going through some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reshaped".
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to re-involve Russia", Coe said.
"We must do everything we can in the coming months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system", he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players in the World Championships in Athletics, which will begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
IAAF Task Force chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for re-establishment.
Drugs testing is still inadequate and banned trainers are still free to work, he told reporters in London after a speech at the IAAF Council.
Mourning for fallen soldiers in Mali
At a funeral in Fritz, northern Hesse, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures.
The defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen (CDU), did not comment on the still-unclearned crash.
She called the two fallen pilots "masters of their craft".
"We bow down to this highest sacrifice they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany", she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse were killed in Mali, West Africa, on Wednesday.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a German death guard to St. Peter's Cathedral in Fritz.
At noon, only the family members in the church said goodbye.
After that, the funeral began in the circle of family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and the politics.
Among them were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the German Defence Force's Inspector General Volker Wieker.
The mourners laid roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzers and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the fallen soldiers as "highly decorated" and deployed.
The Chief of Staff helped build the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots in his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belonged, also stated: "If this crew could not have prevented the collapse, no one would have been able to".
The UN mission in Mali was not in doubt, and Minister von der Leyen did not say that the operation was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "to a country from which we are separated only by two states", she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were taken from the cathedral.
The German army did not say when or where they would be buried.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife.
The husband of Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), of Denmark, does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
The Royal House announced this on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in Roskilde Cathedral.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard had already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the statement said.
Prince Henrik's burial place is still unclear.
But he has no intention of being buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik never made a secret of his unhappiness with his title.
After his wife Margrethe ascended the throne in 1972, he would have liked to have been king.
In 2016, he retired and also took the title "Prince's Spouse".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman for the Danish royal court.
Where the 83-year-old will retire is still unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French nobleman, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the French embassy on the Thames.
While his later wife always expressed sympathy for the people, Prince Henrik had a difficult time with the Danes during his nearly 50-year reign.
In his autobiography, Henrik wrote about his early years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluid, I preferred wine to beer, silk stockings to knitted socks, Citroën to Volvo, tennis to football.
Even for the Gauloises, who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation in this country as the mark of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for forgiveness.
I was different.
I seemed to be content with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick re-election
CDU and FDP in the Netherlands with a possible majority
The Dutch prime minister, Stephan Weil (SPD), has voted for a snap re-election of the parliament after losing the red-green government majority.
Because on Friday he spoke out for the dissolution of Parliament.
The surprise departure of a Green MP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had previously plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date for the parliamentary elections, the Red-Green Coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition CDU and FDP.
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her move by not nominating herself for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU", she said in Hanover on Friday.
The CDU's leader, Björn Thümler, wants to recommend that his party take it up.
The CDU and the FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament, while the SPD and the Greens would have 68 seats.
Until now, the relationship was the other way around.
The new parliament is elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thumler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation.
But Stephan Weil considers it essential that the Landtag decides to dissolve itself as quickly as possible.
The CDU faction is expected to decide on its next steps on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility for the parliament to deprive the prime minister of confidence and elect a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined legally", Thümler said.
"All questions will be discussed in silence, if they are examined in a legally reasonable manner".
Thumler called Twest's move "a little curious".
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good".
She called herself a black-green fan.
The Greens demanded that the deputies who had turned down their mandate return to the parliament.
"We assume of course that she will return her parliamentary mandate, which she received from the Green Land List, with immediate effect", said Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner, the country's chairmen.
The Green Party's chairman, Anja Piel, said: "We regret the decision of Elke Twesten extremely".
The Commission has decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background of no differences in content, we cannot comprehend this step".
The SPD candidate for Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the move of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason.
"The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters, but also betrayal of the Red Green", the head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag re-elected quickly.
The departure of Twesten costs the majority in Lower Saxony.
The politician "in her wounded vanity and frustration she puts her personal interests before the good of the country", criticised SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty plot and is trying to use it to make political capital".
The CDU's leader in Lower Saxony, Björn Thümler, wants to recommend to his deputy that Elke Twesten join the CDU.
The SPD's leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the 2013 parliamentary elections with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest party before the SPD, but the SPD and Greens had a slim majority of one vote in parliament.
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
The Minister for Agriculture, Christian Schmidt (CSU), is speaking and answering in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stain pressure.
The German Länder submit the most up-to-date information on the eggs concerned on the consumer protection portal www.Lifestylewarnung.de.
Eggs affected should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, from what we know at the moment, a health hazard is virtually excluded.
Does Aldi now take the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the box - because the central role of the scout is not really being taken into account by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food surveillance is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house was immediately turned on and I have been in close communication with the authorities of the countries since the concern of Germany was made known.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are fit for transport and safe for health.
Eggs that exceed the maximum residue level of 0,005 mg/kg shall be considered not fit for transport.
However, uninfected eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time it's not the companies.
Are manufacturing and consumers in the same boat?
The Commission has not yet taken any further action to recover the costs of the production of the product concerned.
Rather, they must expect economic damage from alleged illegal practices by service providers.
As always, there are too few controllers in a serious situation.
Is it just the personnel or is it the exclusive competence?
It was the official controls that revealed the incident.
But the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded.
It is for this reason that it is essential to make such incidents known and to hand them over to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may be committed.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the authorities responsible to provide a thorough explanation.
Is regular alerting about food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to only secure and transportable food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The funds allocated have put producers, traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the care of food-supply animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with great emphasis at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and fully.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint Germain in France.
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the governing body that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League.
The Commission has also taken into account the fact that the transfer of Neymar to PSG was financed without significant losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and take him to another galaxy of stars, given the team's funding from Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to acquire players but must use legitimate sources of revenue to counter them, allowing them to break even in their football business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risked bankruptcy if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the clubs' debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - would become a harder matter.
The Commission considers that the Commission is not in a position to take any further action to prevent the spread of the FFP.
And even though Platini fell out of favour with the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to work to deter excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future", Andrea Traverso, UEFA's FFP manager, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can allocate the amount for the billing over the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, which allows the sum of EUR 44,4 million to be reported in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Manchester City-owned Abu Dhabi, face the heaviest sanctions.
PSG were fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the time), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the squad for the 2014/15 Champions League season be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial control by inflating their revenue through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this to be legitimate income.
The Commission also notes that the Commission's decision to grant the aid to the PSA was not taken into account in the assessment of the aid.
It has been reported that part of PSG's payments to Neymar could come through payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors in 2022 and that such a move could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in taking care of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not had any preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a market economy investor in the form of a market economy investor.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and shirt sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers go, and it tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state", La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that funds a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and it's completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country has an association, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country".
Swiss is looking for a new shoe supplier
In recent years, Chocolate Frey has been making chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to an end: the airline is re-writing the order.
The report was published in the newspaper Northwest Switzerland on Friday.
The airline will be able to provide the airline with a new service in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed and quality controlled every two to three years.
"We are very pleased with the current supplier of Chocolate Frey", the spokeswoman said.
About 17 million small red-and-white 14 gram shovel plates are distributed annually to passengers by flight attendants before landing.
The Swiss did not want to comment on the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders in northwestern Switzerland at between 1.5 and 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion francs.
But more importantly, the advertising effect is that it is a prestigious job for a shoe manufacturer.
The Swiss are not willing to give away how many candidates are in the new tender.
Only Swiss manufacturers are involved.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to push for a contract renewal beyond the spring of 2018.
The largest Swiss chocolate producer was not able to reach an opinion for the SDA.
Since 2006, the Swiss have been distributing chocolate tablets on board their flights.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migros' daughter, Barry Callebaut had, in cooperation with Hug, supplied the chocolate tablets.
The possibility of placing the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago when it started working with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, first-class customers are spoiled with treats from Sprüngli's confectionery, Lindt's business class is served with sweets from the business class, and Chocolat Frey's economy class is served with sweets.
Swiss also distributes Chocolat Frey's short-distance shoghies, both in business and in economy class.
Athletics - discus Olympian Robert Harting reaches the final of the World Cup
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, an Olympic winner in 2016, had failed in the national World Cup qualifiers and could only watch the discus competition from the stands.
Also with the first attempt, Polish title-defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters, qualified for the final.
Nostalgia is going to the niches in Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective.
This re-telling of the story is both nostalgic for the glorious days of the characters in the '80s, for the '90s grunge era (when the front-runners David Wain and Michael Showalter were doing the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it's both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag -- middle-aged actors playing tough kids growing up -- they nevertheless managed to recover the last part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody is more of a can-casting principle, including a riff on the 1990s Stalker films like The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
At one point, a character is stomping through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and "a bunch of other stuff from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still remembers Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity yet.
And there's another crazy-villain plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) now backed by George H.W. Bush (a good impression from Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd showing off Matt Dillon's single-tipped chin, whose former big man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old-timer.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise, like a kind of recurring "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I take for its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose final scene will show the gang attending the premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
Comrade Detective on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by The Americans, the film Atomic Blonde, and even GLOW with its East-West Ring Battle iconography.
The comedy, directed by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as director, is a found-footage TV series: a Romanian drama set in the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main characters - a hard-nosed Gregor and an idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some pretty gags to watch (the police spend their time watching chess on TV, like Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent 'find the voice' game.
But Comrade Detective is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama -- a killer wearing a Reagan mask gets involved -- that it often plays out as a single act.
Six long episodes are dragging it down, and the comedy isn't fast enough or frequent enough.
Comrade Detective, which was edited to a shorter length, could deliver its Agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Joseph keep visiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men eating a bunch of hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make anything food for a layer.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we are even doing it with our own more recent history and theirs.
Strike against drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in a strike against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar district, in Rottweil, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Prosecutor's Office Constance reported on Friday.
The Commission has already issued arrest warrants for 15 defendants aged between 25 and 77.
In addition, officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in Italy during similar raids.
The two Italian suspects were subject to German arrest warrants.
The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the operation.
In total, more than 300 police officers were on duty.
The members of the Mafia are charged with organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, and robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor's office has been investigating the organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.
The public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo exchanged views and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
The large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was therefore also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The investigation was primarily directed at Italian nationals with close links to the Italian mafia.
The same incident in Hüfingen on 27 May, in which several shots were fired at a restaurant in the early morning, is likely to go to the gang's account.
The Commission has already published a number of reports on the
"Data of citizens who should not be present": According to one report, the Foreigners' Register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures.
The Federal Government's refugee management officer, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has reportedly drawn attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Defects in the data recorded there could lead to "partially serious misjudgments" in asylum proceedings and deportations, warned an analysis by the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
The register reportedly contains 10 million foreign nationals, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
The data quality has been poor in some parts, since the data has not been maintained adequately.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found "from people who have long since died or from citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register".
"Errary data entries can significantly slow down return processes", the report continues.
The statistics on people with a right to leave also include EU citizens who do not have to leave.
However, such miscalculations led to "a distorted debate on the treatment of expats", the analysis says.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun to send back to Italy refugee families with children under 16 when they have arrived from there.
This is according to an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The document therefore states that the BAMF is carrying out such procedures 'in relation to families with children, except infants and young children, in Italy since 1 June 2017'.
Since the end of 2014, this has been virtually impossible, the newspaper said, citing the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, the EU state that first arrives is responsible for refugees.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
The Office now explains: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back to the country under the Dublin Agreement.
The leftist party's internal policy spokeswoman in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized the decision: "Families with children face a threat of human rights-infringing admission conditions and a threat to the well-being of children because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system".
Second highest result achieved
In total, 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichbach were already provided to other people by the blood donation service.
At least by the 12 citizens who were honored on Friday.
All led by Jürgen Greule, who, with his 100 donations, has now shared 50 liters of blood.
Traditionally, the congregation at the local council meeting appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is brilliant how our bodies are designed for this and we must respect the donors who provide their blood for strangers, even if they are not selfish", emphasized Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single blood donation helps several people", explained the German Red Cross (DRC) director of the Red Cross, Holger Maisenbacher, because the preserves are broken down into their components.
That way, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions to be carried out in Oberreichbach in the spring.
"This year we achieved the second-best result with 114 donors", said the DRC's head of the readiness circle.
Obviously, the move to the theater a few years ago led to higher attendance.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle, and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each.
Half of those were Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe's cousin drank 500 milliliters of their juice ten times.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "low" as it maintains interest rates on family income amid increasing pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) policy makers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7%, and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that interest rate hikes would be necessary in the coming years to curb the inflation fueled by Brexit and it said credit costs in financial markets might have to rise more than expected.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammoth Conjunctivitis package issued a year after Brexit.
It will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financing to banks from February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more under this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the Bank said: 'In the central MPC forecast, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on household real income continues to weigh on consumption.'
As regards interest rates, she reiterated that 'some tightening of monetary policy' would be necessary to cool down inflation and to a 'slightly greater' extent than markets expect.
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
The Bank also noted that the Bank's capital increase was expected to be limited to the amount of EUR [...] million.
The downward adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9%, compared with 1.7% forecasted in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast of 1.8 percent in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after this news.
The pound fell by 0.5% to US$1.31 and fell by 0.4% to EUR1.11.
The decision is not changed after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of interest rate increases and GDP has risen in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little encouragement to households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases, as the tightening will get worse first before it improves.
She added that monetary policy could not "prevent" income declines in the coming years, but she added that wages would recover "clearly" by the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes a year after the rate cut to 0.25% last August, following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years before this fully reaches prices and the economy.
The Bank's latest ruling on interest rates had raised the call for a rate hike as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers demanding a rise to 0.5 percent in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the Bank said it expected this to increase in the coming months.
The Bank said the surplus of 2% was "totally" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market is expected to become more competitive again as lenders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who expire and take out new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular".
The NHS is to prescribe controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people
Patients will be granted access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment starting in September following a High Court fight against drug funding in the NHS.
NHS England has announced that a pre-sexual exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) that can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent is now being supplied by the NHS through a first three-year study of an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before it is launched across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a series of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or as early as two hours before intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, appropriate participants who agree to the study are identified, including men, women, transgender individuals and those who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as it is targeted, recorded and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overhaul the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges".
Deborah Gold, chief executive of NAT, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk for HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.
We welcome this announcement".
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now must be to get the study done quickly across the country and not to leave anyone at risk of HIV behind.
Now that we have the PrEP test medicine, we are on the best path to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV".
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This experiment brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is being done nationwide as soon as possible to protect people who are HIV infected and that it will help us get one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
The big life: middle-class and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrank from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace, and it's proof of the new design that Joanne didn't pack and sell her bags.
"Before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge", says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day".
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely renovated.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement", she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi's architecture and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a middle floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steelworks are quite complicated", he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend.
It was not just a simple platform to build, but to build the steel so that it was the right height for the function above or below".
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height on top of each other - with much additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic Retrouvius copper light window looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the tone for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.
Mirrored units at the entrance will provide space for all of Joanne's cutlery and glasses.
The beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when not in use by perceiving a more glamorous room.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it's a garage door.
"A little engineering went in there", explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, perforated MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily".
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom, and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you're going to sell the land - or how your property is valued", says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the land".
Here they have managed to increase the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"Materials are the things that touch you and that help to create an emotional bond in a home", says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical plugs in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart".
It shows that a home can change from something standard to something amazing by good design and increased square feet.
In fact, like Joanne, you might choose not to leave.
Brothers fighting over a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are in a four-decade-long dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to have his property and business assets split.
Paul had been planning to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp controversy over the split is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother, Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the chief operating officer and dominant personality" in the De Luty family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court filing says that means Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul has $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects", he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - which Colin claims Paul excluded him from.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority", he wrote.
The costs are rising in this case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood mortgage, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a little boy (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court", she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the company and Luke was paid $26 million.
Paul says that both Luke and Mark "became bitter about the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin has held back a lot, despite being a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media has contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin texted back to say, "I really can't say much", because the case is in court.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to drag our family name through the courts", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute", he said, adding that he "always hopes for a solution".
On Friday, that hope seemed to have passed.
"Our case will be settled in the near future by the courts", Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here 's a piece from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior officials on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that gets into the hands of the president.
Kelly told his staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he got good information".
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from positions that were convincing", former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media use includes a steady boost".
- I'm going to get it.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something that we don't know about -- that Trump's tweets would have contained even more fuel without their intervention.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump hasn't sent.
If his associates have managed to keep him out of trouble several times, their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that might promote their views from the world.
Politico, which is very much concerned with this story, reported in May that the advisers preferred to provide the President with questionable information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Today's and former Trump officials say Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he's hard-pressed to find out where they came from.
That's exactly what happened in late February when someone accidentally gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for bullying, or that he offered no concrete evidence, or that he made false accusations in the past and recanted them.
Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh".
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter "attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives".
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than a prop, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the public will be asked for and hoped for.
This summer, police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the wanted criminals are not known, people are expected to ask for information.
Europol reported on Friday on the action following the EU Most Wanted advent calendar for the winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, Europol said.
They've compiled 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches have so far been arrested, at least 11 of them based on information published on the website.
Travelers negotiate a pit and return to the 'Millionaires' line
Some of the wealthiest house owners in the West Midlands are back on the brink of war with some determined travelers who negotiated a community-owned pit to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
The travelers have parked their 20 RVs in a field outside a wealthy street in Solihull called the "Millionaire's Row".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a council-excavated trench to prevent their attacks.
The tactful group found a gap in the defensive systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have pressured the council of Solihull, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More came in last night, probably more today".
She added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long lectures to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can't even stop it".
One resident, who did not want to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers, only to be robbed by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and there was even a horse in the parking lot".
A Solihull council spokeswoman said: "We are aware of an unauthorised camp on the land across Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull Police to take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it's very important that as many residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to give an idea of the situation in which the court must consider when we present our case.'
Birkenhof is transformed into the Waldhotel Luise
The former Birkenhof Hotel is now the Forest Hotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
The closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the Ambiente GmbH on 13 April 2014 resulted in the loss of around 30 000 stays per year and also of income from the tax.
In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in the number of refugees entering the district, the hotel building was offered to the Land Council Office as a collective accommodation, which caused controversy.
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by drawing up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time in the local council.
But above all, Freudenstadt Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel site and spoke about serious interest in the house at the time.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels Group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star plus category house again under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Mountain and one in Bad Herrenhalf.
They're called Hotel Luise, Park Luise, Park Hotel Luise and now Forest Hotel Luise.
The former Birkenhof Hotel has long had garbage containers in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, you can see the extensive renovation work being done.
The floors were torn down, the ceilings partially torn down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The whole hotel building is a single construction site.
There's a lot to do before March.
"It's actually a nice hotel", Thomas Scherer told our newspaper.
I want everything renewed in the black forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area is being remodeled, new windows are being installed.
Everything should be "beautifully civic" later, as Thomas Scherer put it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it".
The facilities include a swimming pool, a spa and a meeting room.
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission's proposals for a new programme of action should be taken in the light of the current situation.
The forest hotel Luise, with its 60 rooms, wants to be wide, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The city's ideas are the same as the hotel group's.
"We're on the same page".
When asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer is not sure how to define himself.
He's counting on less than a million euros.
The external systems are also being moved forward, as is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace is being built, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "The city of joy is a good market".
Russia affair: US special investigator uses grand jury
In the Russia affair with US President Donald Trump, special counsel Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The committee has been working on the matter in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The paper considered the move a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
CNN reported that there were already first subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence has long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller's investigating whether there was a collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is to be several men who served as advisers to the Republican candidate.
Mueller is also reportedly increasingly taking Trump's private and business environment under his wing.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special counsel went to the center personally to investigate the allegation that the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of grand juries is to examine the evidence available in possible criminal cases and decide whether to prosecute.
Grand Juries are therefore also called Prosecution Chambers.
They are usually turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The Board may also be called upon by the Prosecutor's Office to summon persons for questioning under oath.
According to CNN, invitations have already been issued to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
The report said that people who were present at the meeting had been invited to make a statement.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his campaign manager Paul Manafort were also present at the interview.
Legal experts said on US television Thursday night that the move shows Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
But it doesn't necessarily mean that the grand jury will be called in to decide whether to press charges.
Nevertheless, the commission's appointment is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total invention", Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a chance to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about".
His special counsel, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he knew nothing about the grand jury.
But it also usually works in secret, he stressed.
The White House supported any measure that would speed up the work of the Special Investigator in a "fair" manner.
Former FBI Director James Comey has said three times that there will be no investigation against the president.
There is no reason to believe that anything has changed, the statement said.
But Mueller was not hired until after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this, accusations against Trump had been made that he wanted to impede justice.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.
The president is under a lot of pressure about the investigation.
According to US media reports, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his staff.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump would fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent special counsel in Congress, like in the Watergate affair with the late retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position where he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the President's urging.
Several senators from both parties want to avoid this step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday introduced bills that the special counsel could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: A giant iceberg is drifting in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg nearly seven times the size of Berlin has been released from the ice shelf.
This was reported by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremenhaven on Wednesday.
The over a billion-tonne, 5,800-square-kilometer giant is now drifting north and will likely take two or three years to melt.
At 175 kilometers long and up to 50 kilometers wide, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the past three decades.
He's not a danger to humans.
The extent to which climate change played a role in the iceberg's erosion is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual ice shelf collapses in the region for about 30 years, the US Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC) writes in a fact sheet.
Many researchers believe that this could be related to global warming.
The now-broken colossus was previously part of the Larsen-C ice shelf.
Shell ice swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus continues to grow in the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen C-shelf ice sheet is located in the south of South America, almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this shelf, the balance of growth and decay was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete ice shelf was breaking down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some speculation that the Larsen C shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it does now.
In addition, the ice sheet is under stress and may break down if a piece breaks down at a key point.
Melting shelf ice and icebergs does not raise sea levels, as they swim on the water and ice repels as much water as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice sheet will cause the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and to flow much faster than before.
This could potentially raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctic Research Project (Midas).
Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth largest shelf ice shelf in Antarctica, with almost 50,000 square kilometers, according to AWI data.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 metres.
It breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural phenomenon and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position", said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University in the UK.
"This is the largest withdrawal since records began", he confirmed.
Scientists are debating whether the Larsen C shelf will now grow again or decline in the long run and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this giant iceberg to climate change, many Antarctic ice shells have decayed in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica extends into South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice cover has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees Celsius in the past 50 years, making it one of the fastest-growing areas of the world.
The CDU wants a house rate on staff
As job vacancies become increasingly difficult to fill, the CDU is calling for the exit of the employers' union to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the Circuit Day has opened 41 new jobs in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 more trainees have completed their first day of work.
The teaching positions in the circle are obviously very sought after.
Around 620 applications were submitted for the places to be awarded this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to handle the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 vacant posts in the Mettmann district.
The search for doctors and engineers and the general administration is among others.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative to tackle the shortage of skilled workers in the administration, together with the FDP and the UWG, on the Circular Day.
The administration is to 'develop a concept for recruitment and development of personnel', as requested by the parties.
The aim is not only to meet shortterm needs for skilled workers but also to tackle the shortfall of applicants in the future.
The overall approach should be internal and external, show concrete measures for migrant workers and include a training campaign, the CDU, FDP and UWG demand.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle is dealing with personnel issues that you didn't know about before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
In addition, a large number of employees are dismissed for reasons of illness or old age.
It is time to act so that no more jobs remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, the CDU's head of faction, and his party go further than the joint proposal.
He recently gave a fist-thick surprise on the Circuit Day when he publicly questioned staff costs and surprised the other parties.
People want all options to leave the local employers' association to be examined.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration should seek a housing tariff with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the towns in the district", Völker said.
The CDU is trying to pay its employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff.
Wages are currently prescribed exactly, and increases or more money are only possible if you move to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years.
But the role of the circle has grown in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms were needed to provide employees with the provisions of the new law on protection of prostitutes.
Not least, because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Councilman Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy is tightening the tone for NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that rescue migrants in the Mediterranean Sea that they cannot continue to do so unless they follow new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work", Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to the German aid organization Youth Rescue for its crew's effective cooperation with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"To us, saving human lives is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment", the organisation said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the allegations that are being made at this time after we have gathered all the information and assessed the situation".
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of Youth Rescue, the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew is taking on board migrant tubesboats delivered to them directly from human traffickers and that the smugglers can take off so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such gathering allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overstepping the authority of the Italian coastguard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring about "substantial changes or impediments" to their rescue efforts.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libya's coast guard and cooperate with local mayors had paid off.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel", the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Rise and Trial
Nine Weilermer bikers, the Berliner Außenposten and two guests met in Wachenheim, North Pfalz, to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Wachenheim wine and castle festival was a welcome addition.
The first tour led to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim, at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
The viewpoints followed, some of them on towers, from which one could see far beyond the pine forest and the plains in front.
Between then and now, there were longer ascents, rewarding for long trials.
On the second day after Bath Dürkheim, we went to the Saline and the Volksfest sausage market.
The number of people who were in the country who were in the country at the time of the accident was about to increase.
In the last two days, there's been a lot of elevation trends.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, bikers inhaled healing salt in the open air.
New Town was also steered.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4,500 metres of altitude, the group had come to know the Pflazer Forest from its best side - both sporting and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sports
Will the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of sweating their asses out in wind and weather fighting over the stadium races?
The fact is, e-sports have long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business -- big stars, millions of fans, and huge tournaments with high odds included.
This was also recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs to become increasingly involved in this field.
The start of 2015 was made by VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and lastly VfB Stuttgart, which in mid-July founded an e-sports department and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope that this will inspire new young people to join the VfB", says Board member Jochen Röttgermann.
He's sure "there's still a lot of clubs on this train".
Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup will be held in London, where the players from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified for the competition.
Robin Dutt sees great potential in e-sports, too.
Former Bayer coach Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now consulting an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, so that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future", says the 52-year-old.
And the clubs were trying to conquer all kinds of markets, especially Asian ones.
With prominent e-sports players under contract, you could be online much more often in these markets than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What is it, exactly?
In e-sports, computer games such as League of Legends, Dota 2, Counterstrike, and FIFA are contested at a competitive level.
As in normal sports, leagues have long been established in which professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it really a sport?
For many, the idea is certainly a matter of getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also been dealing with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction.
Professional gamers should not only exercise on the console, but also exercise their bodies and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fit player is a good player".
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming an increasingly important issue".
Controls are difficult to implement in online games and the structure of classical sports is missing.
The scientist emphasizes positively the high integration effect of e-sports.
The players are traveling internationally, which is like a big global family, because there are no cross-cultural barriers.
A study by the business consultancy Deloitte and the German Interactive Entertainment Software Association (BIU) predicts a rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were invested in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is expected to be 130 million.
This is not enough compared to the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Football League.
However, e-sports "are not far from other established sports like handball, basketball or ice hockey", write Deloitte advisors.
Many countries are already in the international stage.
Major markets are Asia and the USA, where former basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in eSports betting company Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports were introduced as a subject of instruction, Froböse says.
In the Netherlands and France, the football associations of the first league are now obliged to set up an e-sports department, according to Dutt.
"In European comparison, Germany lags behind", explains VfB's Board of Directors Röttgermann.
Just to be nostalgic and to explain the old days is no longer enough.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but also to orient the company to the modern market.
"We live in a digitalised world", says Dutt.
"You can't just hold on to the fact that football is the way it always was".
Poison eggs - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
The poisoned eggs scandal has now affected almost all federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and have withdrawn all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that are proven to contain no fipronil are to be placed on the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts that urged Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide by texting and calling.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months behind bars for her conviction and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent homicide of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing Thursday, "My family is uncomfortable.
My son was my best friend".
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter was standing there with tears in her eyes, her hands folded and her eyes down when she was convicted.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy", the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She has not taken responsibility", she said.
"She has shown no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance she regrets completely".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find that their "age or maturity or even mental illness have a significant influence on their actions".
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said that "there is not a day that I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything, and I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain we will carry with us forever".
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "haunted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having the one person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I'll always have with me for the rest of my life", she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to urge another person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways", she said in several messages she sent him in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy".
Judge Moniz said Carter was seeking attention through Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through some press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30, wrote in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison".
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lam of FC Bayern
Joshua Kimmich's captaincy at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern is confident of a great season for the Confed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn't hurt.
Something was different in his seat in the cabin, and Joshua Kimmich saw it right away, even though the extra clothing was very, very small.
But since on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, neither Philipp Lahm nor Manuel Neuer could be seen, he kept the bandages on his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it", the Confed Cup winner later told us after his first stint as Bayern captain.
Well, the odds could have been better than the 0-2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could have made Kimmich sound like that.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen as the leader of the C-Eleven, which consisted of young players, debutants and professionals just from vacation, but he.
Sugar is best distributed to those you trust, to those you want to keep in the mood.
So whoever was chosen to inherit the legacy of Lahm could use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: to take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old was flying over the field as a mini-lamb.
Right back, that's his position now, the white bandage on his arm did the rest.
And in all, Kimmich seemed to be the best at steering in this starting lineup.
He gave instructions, tried to guide the unleashed force.
He had the whole thing in his eye, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal was trying to overplay his lack of fitness (barely clinched); Renato Sanches was trying to get the hell out of the Asian Tour (clinched even conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle were trying not to look negative in their first appearance in the Bayern T-shirt.
It worked out fine, anyway.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereign.
The famously occupied Napoli Storm often proved difficult, and Süle also tried to build games a few times successfully.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not what we expected".
But he also performed well on his debut.
Game shift, pace change: "I was also picked up for this style".
How unusual this Bavarian world is for new entrants, was seen after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but probably six or seven.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few sharp statements on the back of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I already noticed what's going on here.
You just have to win every game at Bayern".
He doesn't have to teach the new ones that anymore.
Alaba is motivating women in the Fédération de Finances
David Alaba believes in the success of our women in the OFB
Austria's most famous footballer took to Twitter just before the game and wished the women of the OFB all the best.
The Bayern Legionnaire is a club colleague of the OFB captain Schnaderbeck and feverish with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational shot.
The famous Bavarian duel might be useful to our ladies.
Businesses satisfied with the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises the pace of knowledge
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often irreconcilable when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still the Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year of the new Minister of Economy, Volker Wissing (FDP).
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Community's financial resources are fully used by the Member States.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing addresses the needs of the economy, which Lemke has blocked".
The biggest turning point for Natus is in infrastructure policy: the closure of the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
The Ministry is hoping for a plan-making process this year, with construction permits to be in place by 2021.
The West-Monding Trier is also a key part of the country's roadmap, which is an essential part of the Federal Roadmap.
The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says Ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a way forward for regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier is seeking, as Wissing has encouraged, a Rhineland-Palatinate wine label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which has been declining for ten years.
Furthermore, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, IHK praises.
The Chamber of Crafts of Trier sees the new Master bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A prize of EUR 1000 is provided for the successful master's examination and EUR 2500 for graduates who become self-employed within ten years of completing their master's degree.
But the list of homework for the country is still long.
The planned road construction is a quick fix, but the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers Wissing intends to hire in the national mobility sector, only 29 have been employed so far.
The IHK is calling for more orders to be placed at external offices.
CDU deputy chief Christian Baldauf points to the Court of Auditors' calculations that the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in maintaining state roads in 2017 and 2018 than it has proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a new approach to the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The Commission has also been concerned about the broadband expansion in the country.
In 2016, regional companies had only rated grid supply in an IHK survey with a rating of 3.4.
They're complaining about the Internet connection being down and the disruption.
Former Finance Minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she had already left the field after four months because of disagreements.
Audi is to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - carmakers face a backlash
A day before Audi announced it, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as recall.
European carmakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emission rules.
But the nitric oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to automakers of installing systems to neutralize the exhaust emissions of diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of harassing the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which used so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested but was driving back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe and a US-focused inquiry was expanded.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could be a serious burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profits.
This message has flooded on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
To ensure that visitors to Isar are included, a float will travel through Munich on Saturday with a special message.
If you go to the Isar on Saturday, you'll see a big flood between Flaucher and Reichbach Bridge.
And this is not a regular flush with Isar tourists.
But the building commission wants to clarify.
On the float you can see a large, transparent infographic.
It shows a garbage dump.
The launch of a public campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is"... it aims to raise awareness of the Isar as a protected wildlife stream.
The flood of the Isar last summer and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve thoughtful and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Murder's nostrils and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoonists, and his characters' noses are his trademark.
At 85, the Argentinian is still painting and working on a film.
His message: "Laugh, because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
During his early years as an artist, he excelled as a card drawer, among other things, which frustrated him.
"The happiest day of my professional life was the day I lost my job", he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough in the late 1960s with the publication of his cartoons in Paris Match and then in Star and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Time and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures are intertwined in drawings featuring the Sliding Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London, and Red Square in Moscow.
Early in the morning, he says, he still sits at the drawing table, working almost ten hours a day.
Calendar, puzzles, books for adults and children, T-shirts, pets, and watches continue to make his hilarious figures popular worldwide.
He has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's favorite animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-foot opponent.
His characters will be appearing in the 3D film, which is set to hit theaters in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me", says Mordillo.
He's not the one who wrote the script.
So he's more focused on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavandel from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Institute for Agricultural Research in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbe that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them".
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil is not only attractive to vacationers, but also to perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil".
The solutions envisaged include better water distribution and slowing soil evaporation, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of soil and water and developing varieties more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringia Rhône is celebrating its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
The town is now known for its cattle, pigs, merchants, vagrants and slave camps.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa state caused by organized crime, corrupt officials and the ongoing drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer: take their children to the office who were targeted by a grenade attack in 2009 or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartel, a catalog of criminals who are making Mexico's chaos dangerous.
There is no rest from violence, and while the bodies are piling up across the country, more and more journalists are joining: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection for attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is its editor and inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist", Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in their thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamanian hair.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, the Committee to Protect Journalists said it has only opened two criminal proceedings.
As with most of the thousands of murders that are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, journalists' killers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on dealing with the violence in Sinaloa, despite their discomfort and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information on the killers, without justice, the security meeting is of little use, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop", he says.
"Unless we know why, we'll distrust everyone".
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital city of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which translates to "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly around Culiacan.
But on the Valdez issue, there's practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in the country as rival factions fight to fill the void.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug lords that are bigger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "quiet" when only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes into the United States.
Despite and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is guilty of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members purchased every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 worth of shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without encountering the drug problem", said Bojorquez.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for its courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication that could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in prosecuting Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted to being afraid.
"I want to live", he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life", he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"You have to take on the job that you like as a journalist - either that or you're playing the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in front of so many dead people... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the funny bird who could curse like a harbor worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He'd always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across the street from the office, and he would always sit at the same table.
Now they ask, was his love of routine his ruin?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you're busy with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed", said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier".
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as do Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Suddenly, cell phones were not allowed in the room where Riodoce staff were meeting for security training, and days earlier it was revealed that spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was being used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers were looking for shelter from the 104°C heat in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half a joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police that the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountainous landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition on government spending, focusing on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that was carrying out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the DA's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was exercised when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite spot for drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels for almost a century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been charged with high-profile corruption cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at this venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the best source of information about the kidnapping.
"We would have known what happened before", said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken".
Valdez's office was converted into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murder of journalists because the staff became something they never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration over another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, it's his.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington, D.C., trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they told the truth.
She has since asked the government to re-divide her because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who are undercover with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" has attributed more than half of the attacks to police journalists and officials last year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up", Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my reports".
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her severed head.
Some branches have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the 2004 murder of their director.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page titled "What Do You Want From Us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for danger.
And sometimes they get hunted, as the photographer Ruben Espinosa apparently did, who was murdered in 2015 in an apartment in Mexico City with four women three months after escaping Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue to work, it's a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter", he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk outside the office drinking beer when all of a sudden their phones started buzzing.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the beach town of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.
From the boarding house, they posted the news on the Riodoce website via cell phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens were sounding nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers on duty to see if they were ready.
If they were scared at all, they wouldn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing", said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting".
Dinosaurs used cloaking to avoid their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though a scary one.
Now, researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts have described it as "the dinosaur's Mona Lisa".
It was so well preserved that they could even tell that his skin was reddish brown and they said she had something of a "disturbed past".
A report in Current Biology called it "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle Cretaceous.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as "really remarkable".
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was discovered by Shawn Funk while digging in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock in the square, and decided to look closer.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild animal within the 1,100-pound [2,500 kg] earth cluster.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink a little, you could almost believe it was asleep", said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs".
Researchers have found that this herbivore, although covered in armor and resembling a moving tank, was likely threatened by flesh-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white cloak to hide from predators, and it used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its environment and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Now researchers have studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of shells and armor on his body.
They discovered the counter shading, a common method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the contrasting effect is common, the results are surprising, since the size of borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from flesh-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use the countershading -- think of reindeer, zebras, or belts -- are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaur was in a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been", Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was red-brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for evidence of its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where it sank to the bottom of the sea on its back.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread farther inland than they do today.
"This Nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved shallow skin, but it also remains in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal", Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need much imagination to reconstruct it. If you just blink a little, you could almost believe he's asleep".
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, traversed the earth.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
Among them is the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot-long, six-ton monster.
Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was sunk into the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk while digging in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved armored dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long on average and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long spikes that reached from his shoulders.
Researchers believe the armored herbivore was floated through western Canada until a flooded river swept it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater armour preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover rough panzer plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Stone-painted remains of the skin still cover the hollow panzer plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the shells on his sleeve.'
In the storm: mass mass casualties on A8: Many injured
Thursday night on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car wreck.
There are many injured, miles of traffic jams and gaffer.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass car bombing late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, at about 5 p.m. about 30 vehicles, probably including trucks, collided between the stations of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a storm.
Initially, there was no information on the exact number of injured.
These are minor to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large rescue vehicle was on the scene.
The A8 has been completely closed to Munich.
A backlog of about ten kilometres was formed in the direction of Munich.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive obstacles on the road - through numerous gauges.
The fire department took note of the vehicle's steering signs, which now face delicate penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m., another accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car and a van.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene.
German railway: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It's a moment almost everyone has experienced before: sitting on a train and sleeping without knowing anything.
Or you're deeply into your work and you're just having a brilliant thought.
And then, puff.
The creator comes in and wakes up a man who's not nice or tears the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Check your tickets.
But the days of interruptions are soon over.
The German railway is currently testing the uncreative ticket control.
You just confirm on the phone that you're taking your seat and you devalue the ticket.
There are currently two test runs.
"When the offer comes in, let's expand.
It will then be expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany early next year", said a rail spokesman.
"Comfort check-in" is the name given by the railway to the ticketing process without a Schaffner.
However, to use them, you must meet certain requirements: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked a ticket online, which most passengers already do.
You must also have purchased it through the train app, DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get on the train, you call your ticket under "My tickets".
The test customers will then be given a button for electronic decommissioning.
The train's passengers receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.
When the train attendant arrives at the ticket checkpoint at Y, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with a discounted online ticket.
So you can sleep on, you can work on, you can keep quiet.
The check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is to benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel through our train staff without checking your tickets, you can check in with DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal", says Michael Peterson, Marketing Director at DB Transport.
Second, "and our employees have more time than they do today to address individual customer needs".
If you travel by train often, you know that, besides being late and missing trains, checking tickets is one of the biggest problems.
Because often you have your own, but in any case one of the travelers doesn't have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the ID card or another document that you have to show is missing.
The result is endless discussions between the train's passenger and the train's passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the cabin or the large room and delays in checking your ticket and the creator ends up taking the time to take care of other matters.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that's only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been unlocked.
How did an activist learn the answer to the question, "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis native was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a mail from someone from high school.
"Police just killed an 18-year-old child, and he's still lying on the street", it said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The St. Louis area rapper was tweeting live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"This is wild", Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to them or their community.
She put down her phone to tweet about people on the Canfield drive later that evening.
There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and a man claiming to be Brown's father, who was wearing a sign that said, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She was watching a live feed where a police officer was standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another cop disarmed his rifle and shouted, "I'm gonna kill you... animals all".
"That's not common", Ferrell recalled.
"This is not the kind of murder we're used to and can call typical".
At that moment, I felt a tremor of frost.
I was angry and I cried".
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?" in theaters starting on the 11th.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, from the perspective of people living in the community who have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and a matching crown, the two had a conversation they had countless times before that morning about the black experience and the black condition.
"Remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me", Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well-developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she's no different than the next black woman's child.
I feel like I would be doing her a bad service to keep her away from it".
The first station they arrived at in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station that became a campground as activists waited for Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-accusation.
Ferrell and her daughter met a local business owner who was cooking lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism has changed completely since August 9", she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come to pass".
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were just trying to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism has been nurtured by countless instances of people, often whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices, and we wanted to do it differently".
Folayan had already collaborated with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, and along with six other locals, the Whose Streets team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people were portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed".
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not about a Messianic leader, but a community coming together", Folayan said - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets" documents reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as he falls in love and marries his wife.
"I felt like naked", Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I've come to understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people".
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who shaped the social media film "BlacklivesMatter" after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall", Ferrell said, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the brunt of everything".
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really being sustained by black women and many black women".
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy", she said.
"It's no coincidence that she was on the front lines, because there's so much at stake in a life at these crossroads as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen".
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police still exist.
Ferrell is on probation for two and a half years for blocking a freeway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home, "a chaos".
Yet she's been clinging to a song and she's been committed to that memory ever since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains".
From "dream" to "craziness": TV readers discussing bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, even though it hasn't been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since it was first introduced in 2009.
Cold doesn't leave you with the subject.
The issue is also discussed on our Facebook page "People's Friend Bitburg".
While some say to the bit gallery, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really cool" (Nicole Schausten), the other side says, "Don't need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or simply, "Great madness!" (Lars Scholz).
While proponents are building on the idea that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, which will benefit other businesses, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery will be located on the same plot as the Farmer's Market Hall, where 13 direct marketers will be offering their products.
When the construction works begin, it will be finished.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We've been shopping at the farmer's market almost weekly for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farmers women always very much.
We also discovered the butcher's shop for ourselves.
We would like to see this offer continued during and especially after the gallery is built.
There are other cities where they do.
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting".
Gerdensing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the rent.
It is not likely to be low for the new project".
Eva Kilic: "Why are there shopping malls in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothes, shoes, pharmacies or supermarkets, I think that's superfluous.
There's enough of that in our town.
You can see how many shops are empty here, some for months or years.
But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the basis of the information provided by the Commission.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies, because the rents there are often not affordable for a retailer.
It's a shame there are almost no special shops and what's left of them will probably disappear".
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
First of all, where is the farmer's market hall to go during construction?
The old Edeka would be the solution, even if it's going to be long term, because the bit gallery is actually coming.
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to drive all the businesses out of bitburg before?"
George Marquet: "This is just not going to work.
And a shopping mall that's empty doesn't need anyone.
I think it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market than this gallery.
But a farmer's market hall is no longer possible because of the insane number of - I think - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again".
A fitting resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York City, you can see many faces - white, black, and brown, almost unremarkably similar - hanging from cables on the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek-tapping and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after making public classified diplomatic communications via the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and groundbreaking dissident whose conviction was overturned by Barack Obama when he was only three days into office.
Dewey-Hagborg, by using the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of what someone with this genomic data might look like, has created a sharp, if intellectual, commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her teens, was convicted in 2013 of 20 counts, including six counts of espionage, computer fraud and theft.
The prison had suppressed her image so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie, in which Manning was sitting uncomfortable in a wheelchair wearing a platinum blonde wig - that she was associated with.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just returning from the huge success of her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That's when she got an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They were interviewing Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article", Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press briefing of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at the time, and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal correspondence friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic strip by Shoili Kanungo called "Suppressed Images", which predicted a future where President Chelsea would change her decision and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning's release a few days after the book was published after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison was a welcome kind of happy reunion.
There's something deep and strong about the opening of the exhibition, too, as Donald Trump wages a war against government informants and transgender troops to find new, two-way ways to further ignite the rigid divisions he was supposed to resolve.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said, "Things happen for a reason".
In an artistic statement written on the gallery wall, Manning, with her oversized signature below (the "i" in her family name is a heart) called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation that has been based on gender, race, sexuality, and culture".
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence -- a thousand-foot of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's highly developed scientific lexicon) how amazingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
"What people are hoping to take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective it is", said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on view.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories".
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a private room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
It shows Manning emerging from the United States disciplinary barracks with a free-speech phone in her hand, like King Kong.
"If they keep your speech cold, they win", they say.
"So never shut up".
"It came straight from a letter she wrote me", said the Philadelphia-based artist.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it".
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person yet - as was predicted in the comic book - but if she does, she'll be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulators, gathering like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, down to the size (5" 2, Manning's stature) where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd", Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind their release".
Professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was fatally stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to Cook County court records.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stab wounds.
A community warning system issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments, and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stabbing as murder, while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now on leave and banned from entering Northwestern University's campus.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation", Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A University and Somerville College spokesman said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the UK police and ready to assist the US investigating authorities in any way we can".
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said he urged the suspects to report to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying", Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
Security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship", Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team released a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident".
"We will conclude the WADA Roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) were implemented.
'At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect", Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap for Compliance with the Code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause Russia to worry.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future", he added.
However, one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
In relation to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist".
Mutko's words were in agreement with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian retail outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally", Smirnov added.
In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from conducting doping controls in Russia by WADA in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to be re-commissioned.
Aldi is not selling eggs for now.
The company groups reported this.
The Commission has also proposed a new directive on the protection of the environment, which is to be implemented in the light of the new rules on the protection of the environment.
As of now, only eggs that have been tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-fouling agents should be supplied to Aldi.
Aldi is trying to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The start-ups that will help your business not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to test your employee's happiness in your e-commerce startup, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or - worse - deceitful.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There was just never consistency and objectivity", said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She's been calling out for help.
A new breed of HR start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographics, provide employee anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, allows whistleblowers to bypass C-Suite executives and contact the board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of specific teams, it provides a company heat map that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval ratings - so you can dig up why.
Companies are coming to realize that they need to stay on top of workplace culture so they don't become the next Uber to be involved in scandal since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire for a review is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technology website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a surge in interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber miscredit case.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailored "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the CEO is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has caught up with the regulators", said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
When a company is found to be treating its employees badly or behaving unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee fluctuations and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email to the company headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that Convercent is using it, problems that were previously hidden by executives in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of the employment experience", said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group at Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation".
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical violations in the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until "social media came to its right" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before the use of technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy", he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies recurring fees for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that's getting the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little of a surprise given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work they do is worth it, they feel more committed to making that company successful", said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make a profit when their portfolio companies are doing well. Companies are doing well when their employees are committed and committed.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it's no wonder you'll find support.
Data on employee engagement is important according to experts in workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for their feedback, they can expect change to be on the way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, it can bring about disappointment and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations", said Russell Raath, president of consulting at Kotter International, a business management firm that has seen companies rely too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
You'll take care of it?
And who doesn't care, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Rescue.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the problems, thanks to the speed of decision making and the quality of communication.
Ruby Tuesday is giving the company new insights into its employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better employee engagement in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people", said Vitrano.
"And when you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you're going to lose businesses.
The NCAA is eliminating the two-day practice and making it a long day for the Bruins.
It's almost 11:00 p.m. when a bunch of UCLA football players are chatting on a side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their shirt parts and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes are a lunch break.
Players who have signed up for the summer training will return to their final exams after the three-hour practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real kick-start for the boys over the next three days", Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day workouts to ease the players' burden, and it's actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
So the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 7:15 p.m. to meet the players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the start of camp almost a week after last season and conducted practice during the first six seasons of Mora's Westwood summer school.
They're scheduled to practice 18 times throughout August, 20 before the formal game preparations for their opening game against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule change, even if it adds another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging", Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they stuck it out, they're great people.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great".
UCLA will end its internship once the camp is complete, which, given the clear views of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel already being pitched with footballs that cleared a safety net behind a goal post, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admitted there could be a problem once these rooms are open for the season.
"We're going to use our security", Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far off to think that people rent a room there and then set up to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security there, and we have security in parking lot 8.
We're gonna do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan".
Facebook wants to step up fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential fake news articles to third-party fact-checkers and then show their results under the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect potential false reports and send them to fact-checkers who may display the results of the fact-check from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe it influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May, and Germany supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly remove hateful posts as they did before the September elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to knowing which stories are challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share", Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature for the "linked article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England
In its recent past, the small Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mofo-haired Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years", he says in painful tone.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand".
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardes and documents the families who lived in Scotney, each story illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he wrote Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the page of a letter written by a double agent working for the Jacobins in the 1700's", he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because that's when you started a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were in it.
I love the archives!"
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and has lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I overestimated my welcome a little bit") all this seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives, and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyenas' heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle, talking to landscapers, gardeners, and sometimes even the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not receive full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the staff was just beginning to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years of aristocrats saying, 'Oh, throw it to the attic.'
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You might think land conflicts would be boring", says Rhodes, "but there was a brick that the two families fought for.
Guys, let it go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that took place in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,'" says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area, and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe they're connected?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the castle's history - such as "The Priest", which tells the story of the Jesuit father who the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', which depicts 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family from Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys with a talent for promoting wives".
After completing his assignment at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave again", he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the fucking life again".
Campaign launched: over 300-year-old chapel of the Virgin Mary in Rhöndorf covered
With the cover of the 301 year old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand (Thursday's roundup).
Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz are still trying to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday.
At the end of August, the campaign will culminate in a celebration on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too good for us.
Or?" the action makers have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't really think that (of course!) " they write on their website, which was unlocked yesterday.
"But we're using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are convinced that as Bath Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city".
The action is more than just a logo and a slogan, it goes on to say.
"It is necessary to make a single-entry pledge, one that gives the city a distinctive unique characteristic".
It is, after all, in competition with other municipalities.
A medium five-figure amount is enough to cost the city of Bad Honnef its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year, at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) consults in Ankara on pensions and promotion in the officer corps.
So was this week.
At first glance, it's a normal process.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was held not in the General Staff building as before, but in the Prime Minister's office.
The five Vice-Prime Ministers, as well as the Ministers for Defence, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs, also took part in the consultations.
That's why the civilians in the YAS were outnumbered.
The government is taking control of the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar will remain in office, but the commanders of the army, air force and navy have been removed.
Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
The 486 people who are believed to have been directly involved in the coup attempt are being tried in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the coup attempt as a "gift from God" because it gives him the opportunity to "completely clean up" the forces.
But does Erdogan really have the army under his control?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Discomfort at the Military Headquarters".
The general staff is concerned about the increasing "Islamization" of the army, which is reflected in the lifting of the ban on female soldiers wearing headscarves, the newspaper wrote.
The army and security forces are still cleaning up.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered the firing of another 7,395 civil servants, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the real masters of the land.
Three times they staged a coup, citing their role as guards of worldly state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed the military's power back step by step, not least by citing the reforms of the European Union.
Former officials say Erdogan is deliberately pushing for the Islamization of the military.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who sought asylum abroad for fear of persecution after the coup attempt warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that happens, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
The Turkish army is not ready to be used, however, in the aftermath of the clean-up.
NATO diplomats say that the leadership structures and operational capabilities are "weakened".
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It plans to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, tougher rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be debated in both houses of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens from other countries".
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy", Trump said, quoted by American media.
Ministry wants to renovate track for racing shuttle
The future of the racing shuttle has been debated over and over again in recent months - and now it is expected to be done quickly.
The construction of the marod line on which the tourist railway runs is to be completed before the end of the year.
The Ministry of Transport has said that construction work on the route will begin this year to secure the future of the raceway in the long term.
"With the decision to order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to becoming a major tourism hub", Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl said on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the track was estimated at about EUR 2.5 million.
Of that sum, the country takes 75 percent.
The agreement, which will continue to be ordered by the country, is currently being finalized, Sühl said.
The Ministry and South Thuringen Railway as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
"This is the negotiation of the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards", Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission should take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet established the compatibility of the aid.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular train connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, especially among tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation has been carried out to test whether the route is used by enough people to order regularly in the future.
The route is also partly very busy.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried.
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any crazier, a new report comes out about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, I did.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nipples and the type of fingernails.
"People laugh at them, but companies are delivering a lot of them, and we're going to see them a lot more often", Mr Sharkey said when he released his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the color of the robot's eyes to the shape of his nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it's even more disturbing because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities like "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well suited to your personality as possible", says True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She's got her moods in the daytime, just like real people!
She may be tired, fixated on conversation, or "in a mood!"
There are many worrying aspects to this rise of sex robots -- not least because they replace real human relationships -- but the submissive female traits, the allusions to rape, when you take a step at Frigid (meaning: refractory) Farrah, are the most worrying.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" says the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR is seeing their growing popularity, they are still temporarily on the edge of consumer culture.
But what's leaking from the periphery can be very instructive about the spirit of the times we live in.
And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There's a certain overlap in the fact that these highly-developed sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, when there's a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most discouraging aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' is not the graphic images, the swallowed bodies and the pierced eyes, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it doesn't feel like a big leap.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as possible (although with pornographic proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities", robots don't represent real women.
You can't separate from your companion or just walk away.
They have no intermediary or background, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they're pleasant slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 way: maidens.
Trump's big hit?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense.
It's become a core wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. election have also divided families in the small data.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the United States offering advice on how to deal with the horror of relatives electing Trump.
We're all supposed to be working hard to blow up our filter bubbles.
Less noticeable is Trump's power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has been involved with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kin she'd fought for decades over politics, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same page.
I would like to say that the Commissioner has not yet made a decision on the matter.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disruptive effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about normalization and Trump, we're referring to the creepy possibility that one day his mates won't push us back.
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario where Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be a concept of rationality when compared to his standards.
I find myself today haunted by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the crazy - the dog on the roof of the car, the 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, in comparison to Trump, seem to be very mild crimes.
If Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate just needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York City parking lot carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder -- all the clowns are roaring and the animals are twisting to look over their shoulders in fear -- extremely dark, and the crawling music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings get old, the skylines get too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day, when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not actually a Swiss cottage - the theme-pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a big traffic circle in north London.
But the Central Park carousel is still a weird magical experience, because here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go and have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked.
On the other hand, this week I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars at a department store before I could get through my credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same thing, plus the option to match the valuation with a 15% tip - to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to put personality in a situation where none is needed.
The poor woman in the store was standing there smiling apologetically while I was tired of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pains
Pistorius left prison for a second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which prison authorities said he suffered after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutor's office against a first-degree manslaughter conviction.
He killed Stenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, shooting her multiple times through a toilet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a night-time intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Criminal Investigation Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of being sentenced to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
The last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were dismissed for the holidays and for further education.
Three of the dismissed students will go to high school, four to the real school.
School principal Angelika Sitte greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental town hall in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school leaving, the 29 pupils of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken coop but was then released.
To that end, the cheerful crowd performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Chicken Barn".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it sprout from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him fell apart, and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Afterwards, the third and fourth grades of Yvonne Frank's classroom showed a chicken dance.
The hens danced with the young gooks who carried the cylinders to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The young are different from the other young, but they are part of it.
But he'll never be like a chicken.
He was destined to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted into her new school.
The words of thanks were addressed to the colleagues, to the former headmaster Michael Müller, who has been constantly speaking out against the lack of education, and to the parents' representatives.
The chicken season is over, class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained.
She's very reluctant to fire her students after two years of teaching because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all the students sang a song about summer and holiday.
The children were very happy.
Eight first-graders have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported, quoted by television.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegal campers were arrested in Sithonia by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, while an investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened controls on the free camp and are imposing significant fines on anyone found staying in a place not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly is the software update going?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the campaign?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the Volkswagen Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are designed to improve the exhaust performance of Euro 5 and Euro 6 cars.
Euro-4 diesel or less are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives an estimate:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates we negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have forged software", says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Motor Agency (FMA) has ordered their re-equipment.
How and when are customers informed of updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has informed us to address all those affected.
If an inspection is due, it will be carried out within the framework of the inspection.
How long will the total re-equipment take?
"It's hard to say", says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and political pressure.
"Because we have seen that carmakers have not taken voluntary action on the environment so far".
How long is the update going to take?
The reassembly itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It may be more time consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who don't drive cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the Volkswagen Group do?
The ACE advises you to wait.
It is likely that foreign manufacturers would be following suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there a risk of a massive price drop for Euro-4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But it's in the regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
ACE advises you to wait until the sale is complete.
LL Cool J receives the Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the prizewinners doesn't want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the most coveted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year's honours include singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and television producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be presented in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife Melania.
Lear, who is known for his progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not be attending the gala.
He told The New York Times: "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and that burdens me".
Estefan, 59, said she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city planner, is retiring next year.
The job has already been offered - but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city planner for 31 years.
And he still enjoys the job, as he explains in the press conference.
He reports on the varied but challenging tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet met the requirements.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest opportunity.
The Commission therefore considers that, in the light of the regular notice periods, there is still sufficient time for a draft.
Since Haslach is the lower building authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have the relevant financial statements.
Because this function is something the city wants to keep.
If they can no longer fill them in, the citizens will have to go to Offenburg for consultation.
But citizenship is important to the city and to itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good working environment and good mood between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, there have been a number of important projects that Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We are making the city worth living", he says of the construction company and its employees.
But even in the future, a variety of projects are on the agenda: the redevelopment of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, has been initiated.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and the stadium renovation is still an issue.
The latter alone will be worth about 1.5 million euros, Wacker estimates, "if we do it right".
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
It's fun to work here".
There is a lot of room for design for a city builder.
With Haslach's own yard and gardening, many things can be tackled flexibly.
"You can move a lot", Wacker said, and the design of the greenhouses is often praised by citizens and visitors.
As the old town is protected as a monument, it is important to "keep an eye on what fits" when new buildings are approved, the departing city builder stresses.
The city builder is a great responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything goes over my desk".
In the field of support and coordination, he can count on longtime employees: Markus Neumaier (high-rise construction) has been with him for ten years, Manfred Schöner (deep construction) for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay long, saying, "We're looking for someone who really identifies with the job and wants to stay".
This is because continuity is important not only for a good working environment but also for the further development of the city.
The city of Haslach has informed the applicant that he or she should be able to obtain a diploma in engineering or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good knowledge of the law of planning and construction.
The Office of Urban Planning is responsible for the construction of buildings, planning, land acquisition, administration of urban properties, urban workshops with urban gardens and gardening, and the Lower Building Authority, including the Monuments Protection Authority.
Bicycle thrown on wires: Southbound track blocked
According to the police, the unknown perpetrators threw the blue bicycle from the railway line over the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators are looking for two male perpetrators since night time.
Witnesses had observed a pink bicycle and a rider near the scene.
"This is far beyond a whispering exercise", said Christoph Posch, spokesman for the OBB.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the train and the installation, the delays and the costs of railway replacement services, the offenders could also face penalties from railway customers.
The Commission's proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment in the Member States is therefore not in line with the objectives of the regulation.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, and rail traffic on the Southern Railway line was able to run without obstacles.
Almost ten passenger trains had been discharged on Friday morning, two of them involving long-distance traffic.
Goods trains failed, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, affecting some 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that a type of tolerance-boosting immune cell is found in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacteria need tryptophan -- one of the building blocks of proteins -- to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more of these immune cells they had".
He suggested that combining L. reuteri and a diet high in tryptophan would promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment if the same system worked in humans.
Postdoctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separately housed, did not.
She suspected that the difference was because of the gut microbiomes of mice -- the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were six types of bacteria found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but were missing in the mice without them.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a gut microbiome and they didn't develop this kind of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and they got the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active ingredient was cleared from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of the tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's food, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuterium in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the gut.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may potentially lead to an expansion of this population.'
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" to Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed Nemanja Matic as a "genius", Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Chelsea's £40m signing began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last preseason game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holders' role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira made their way up the ladder.
However, Matic had been ruled out of the Blues' pre-Asian tour and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he needed to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football", Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready sooner than later".
Alongside Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium, as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of his four top new commitments.
"Getting three out of four, I thank the club for that", he added.
"I'll be happier if they get me four out of four, but they've put in a lot of effort".
Boeing painted dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots were flying from Seattle, Washington, but the shooting started in Marquette, Michigan, and then it took the form of a dreamliner over the United States, which is several thousand miles.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens, it was the shape of a dreamliner.
It was a test of endurance for new engines.
Boeing had advertised this before.
That's how the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
We have a problem.
The wind is blowing: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
It was not a firestorm from the party headquarters, it was not a windfall from the federal government - that was the main wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, things have changed fundamentally.
Since then, the staff of the Willy Brandt House have been watching with increasing horror the events in the SPD-ruled provincial capitals.
What Schulz has been getting from there since the beginning of the year, it wouldn't even be described in the approach with headwind.
It was a deep blow.
One by one.
The Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens after the surprise end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony.
"This shows once again that red-green simply cannot govern reliably", CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprise departure of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the parliamentary elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The Green Party's managing director, Michael Kellner, has called on the backstabbing Lower Saxony Green Party member, Elke Twesten, to resign.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of voter will.
Elke Twesten must immediately resign", the German Federal Executive Director and campaign manager of the Greens told the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true", sighs an SPD candidate as the new job message reaches party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is standing without a majority government after the Green MEPs, Elke Twesten, joined the CDU.
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of crises, big and small, in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
One blue eye, that's all. The comrades of that time calmed down.
After the parliamentary elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, things will be different.
And then it did - and it got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to a standstill, the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute the party smoothly.
The comrades recalled themselves in the weeks that followed.
Then, as they had just gained new courage, the G20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with it came the next deep blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD national leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication after that, which you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now we have Stephan Weil.
The Commission has also been criticized for its role in the monitoring of the VW emissions and the role it has played in the Supervisory Board.
Bad survey results came in.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been trying to put more and more emphasis on the federal government in recent weeks.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden from comrades around Martin Schulz.
They were granted it because they promised Weil a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
We must not forget that the Commission has not yet taken a decision on the proposal for a directive.
And not Schulz at all.
The comrades therefore try to keep their own ranks closed.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Community's financial resources are fully used.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy that Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above everyone else's", says Matthias Miersch, head of the Left Party in the SPD Bundestag faction, the Redaktionsnetwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mrs Twesten was not elected to Parliament because of her direct candidacy, but through the national list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continued.
The logical consequence would be that she resigned.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag, has complained of an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The will of the electorate was clear four years ago: the people made Stephan Weil prime minister", Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the Bundestag election, told the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result", Oppermann continued.
He demanded that the background be clarified.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments by the CDU in Lower Saxony.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a regulation on the implementation of the programme.
Those who want to renovate their years-old home will soon be able to get support from the country.
This was reported by Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Urban Development on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a second look back at what had happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the 1991 to 2004 restructuring zone I, the State of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the total funding.
In the 2005-2016 period, the grant was still 60 per cent in the rehabilitation zone II.
For Schindler, the renovations so far are a 'successful project' - it is important to promote interior development, not just new construction sites.
On 4 April the Government of Karlsruhe informed it that a rehabilitation zone III would be established.
The total amount of the aid is EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 came from the country, the rest from the municipality of Gdansk.
How does a rehabilitation area come about?
Schindler went on to say that the "really old" houses will be examined.
The Commission has also decided to take a decision on the basis of the information provided by the Commission.
If necessary, the boundaries of the territory could then be moved again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday night.
Keller presented the contents of the Federal-Länder programme Social City, where the renovations would then be carried out.
The programme is based on the revitalization of urban areas, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-specific basis, i.e. per plot.
The area of rehabilitation would then be defined by statute.
The period of authorisation for the grants shall run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, the survey would not be completed until September of this year, when the survey will be completed by the operators involved in the restructuring.
The legislative decision is expected to be taken in November or December, if possible, so that the renovations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality must carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is a matter of assessing urban development problems and deciding when and to what extent they will be repaired.
A renovation note will then be entered in the land register for the land.
Pietzschmann himself will come again after receiving a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that the participation of stakeholders was a key success factor for the project.
For this reason, questionnaires will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the 'Buildings and Land Register', which covers, inter alia, the building condition and the plans for renovation.
The grey questionnaire, the 'House and Housing Survey', provides information on the size, distribution and occupation of a living space.
The blue 'business arrow' shall only be filled in if there are business premises in the building.
However, it should be noted that a completed questionnaire is not an aid application at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funds works according to the "wind dog principle" - who comes first grinds first.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to grant a grant to the beneficiary.
Finally, photographs of the "Ortskern II" project were shown to make the renovation "tasteful" for those present.
British inventor sets up a microchip to get into a house and car with a single hand
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand motion.
Steven Northam, 33, implanted the tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consulting anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted in cats and dogs and only lasts 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to modify the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an additional £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built technology into both his home and his BMW Z4 that starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House advertising costs taxpayers thousands of dollars .
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to military data handed over to TIME magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is on board, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-built helicopter was presented alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi forklifts.
The White House military office demanded the helicopter's presence in a fragmented order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it's such an unusual event with high visibility", the commander of the HMX-1 wrote to his supervisor, the deputy naval aviation commander, on the eve of the event.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 for the event at 3 p.m., and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, due to the restrictions on hours of service, a second crew would be needed for the return flight.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
The records provided to TIME did not indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the order.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case", the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up", replied the deputy commander.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave a boost to the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he promoted efforts to curb government regulation.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for political advantage is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But asking them to use it for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was providing taxi services in the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
"The White House is thrilled with the Made In America show - showing products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials", said Lindsay Walters, the White House deputy press secretary.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights around Washington and the South Lawn to drop the US president at the White House with precise centimeter rates.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 drill landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was among the flight crew training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said taxpayers took the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in the deployment of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established the compatibility of the measures with the internal market.
Unit records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs of operating the helicopter are well below this rate.
"It is highly misleading to estimate the cost to taxpayers based on the estimates of the refund rates", said Walters.
"These estimates include staffing, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual budget".
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things that are made in America", Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on it.
And I think like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to emphasize this".
It was unclear if Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the president, "I have three of them".
TC Neuss before a tricky task
The top rider of the second tennis league will take the third place in the table, Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will be in Kiel tomorrow at 11 a.m. for the third round of the Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games of still impeccable record, the top rider in the second-tier tennis league has retained a sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team, always playing in a very similar formation.
I think the team is very good, especially in the back positions".
The main factor in ensuring class and stability in the Suchsdorfer SV is imports from the north.
"The Danes and Finns may even refer to bets in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in the double", says Zay, looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all of Denmark).
"It's going to be hard for us, as always.
You need a good portion of luck".
Our new team for the trip to the high north is practically ready.
His debut for Blue and White could be Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman is still active in the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, but does not play in the Bundesliga, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) will make his first appearance this season.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
He was also to be present in Kiel, along with Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories against the Alster club last Sunday, Máté Valkusz could be back in the team.
Is it not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay is filling the staff.
How the OMV Can Harm America
Donald Trump didn't seem really happy when he signed the law on Wednesday night to tighten sanctions against Russia.
"In his haste to pass the law", Congress packed in some "unconstitutional regulations", he said.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was spewing against the US advance.
The draft plan, after all, aims to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, investors of the local OMV have since become concerned, which together with other European companies co-finance the construction of Russia's Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea Line.
The threat is enormous.
However, it is too early to assess the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
He's got 12 guns to choose from.
The press looked at which ones the company could fight back and which ones could really hurt it.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is in the spotlight on Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which unveils Pablo Escobar's killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first one receiving its first trailer and showing the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the richest drug trafficking organization in the world: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful bosses, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
The city is deploying 46 kitchen aids
The city is organizing the Kita lunch again.
With fixed contact points for the kids and a team assignment.
In urban daycare centers, the clock is turned backwards.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply of the urban children's daycare facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the Youth Department, this is good news: "We were all very pleased".
The cooking continues outside the house: a caterer takes over the task and delivers fresh cooking and chilled.
The town operates 46 daycare centres in the Krefelder area, and 44 of them provide warm meals at noon.
Last year, 2,800 children each sat at tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat lunch in the manger", explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies to the 35-hour day care if children stay until 2 p.m".
46 part-time staff will be on kitchen duty from 1 September: they will heat the food delivered, supplement it with salads, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, spend the food, clean, wash and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are assigned to a kitesurf", says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group and seven-group facilities - determines the hours.
"The female kitchen helpers are now part of the kites team", says Pommeranz.
"They are much more integrated and it is easier for the guitarist to implement educational concepts".
Because that's what it's all about: healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"Let the children help prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
For the kids, too.
"They have a known power in the kites, a person they trust, not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the kites - which has been the task of the kitchen staff until now - will be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has the charm of improving the quality of kitchen service and has proved to be the most economical in comparison to the cost of ownership and borrowing for the city, the press office said.
And that's despite the fact that 46 part-time employees are being recruited.
"But those hours are not as important for about 750 people in education", says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the UN mission, said hundreds of women will be running for the provincial council elections, three women will be running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated", he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an electoral process that coincides with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year's elections will be the first time that power will be passed peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan reports that 1.2 million women are registered among the 3.6 million registered voters.

After that, Kaiseringen has coffee, cake, cold drinks, wire sausage and cheesecake.
If you need a ride from Kaiseringen to Frohnstetten, meet at Kaiseringen's school.
Men trying to rob a 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, reportedly tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police reports, the men contacted the 13-year-old girl, who was staying with friends on Kolping Street, at about 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to use the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old, however, refused and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's phone and necklace, but failed.
Without a prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB's concern about investments in the McVitie plant in Glasgow
A trade union wants to ask the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits alongside other products.
McVity owner Pladis said he's invested more than £5 million in the last few years.
He added that employees and union representatives would "be the first to know" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's head of branch, GMB Scotland McVitie's requested to 'express concern that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being advanced'.
Drew Duffy, GMB's senior organizer, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the General Site Manager on the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and Greater Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social exclusion.
In view of the prospects of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the context of Brexit, rising living costs and a chronic decline in production, the east end of Glasgow therefore urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie.'
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The Tollcross branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the ongoing commitment of employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some issues were openly discussed.
We discussed with the staff that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we should constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "Over the past few years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully acknowledge the heritage of Tollcross as a production site, and if our operations on site change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know".
Did PSG Barcelona warn you about Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won't slow down in their pursuit of Neymar after making a £189 million offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record-breaking three years ago?
The sensational approach has heated up the transfer window this summer as the Ligue 1 club is poised to break the world record by more than double the previous record, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
After the end of the season, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona are angry at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always done its best to take care of him since arriving from Santos in 2013.
But was the world of football warned three years ago by the PSG president of this prospect?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will oppose them, we will contact their players", Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign, it will have consequences".
Barcelona seem to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club earlier this summer expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prize offers to Neymar.
Rollers rolled over and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown assailant deliberately overturned a scooter in Königsfelder Straße outside property number 30, causing over 200 euros in damage to the vehicle's disguise.
Police are calling Schramberg, calling 07422/27-01-0, asking for leads.
Police are looking for witnesses to an accident on B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car came upon him on his track, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade and touched the control panel.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was driving his VW at about 7:55 p.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau towards Leese.
In the area of the Stolzenau bypass, a car came to meet him on his driveway, so he had to turn right.
The Touran driver touched the control panel.
The car suffered property damage.
The driver of the car in front, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the injured party, it may be good that the Mercedes driver did not notice the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the vehicle to contact the Commissariat in Stolzenau on 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
That's what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen is still a source of discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church", said after a statement to the German Press Agency that he expects an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the cathedral chaplain Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the late Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very helpful to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret for their own omissions or their then wrong assessment of the proceedings.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticized the "twice-size" of violence in the Vatican.
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future, but the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, says author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The practice of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evil is part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to view it as normal", writes Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation: "You like going to church and that's a found food".
She also pointed out that in her youth, "beats were a very normal educational tool" "to deal with cowardly children like me".
They would find it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of abuse, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger also often appeared.
Writer and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memoir "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages), is completely wrong.
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger into custody", says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him", he says of the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was assigned by the Bishop of Regensburg to investigate the situation?
A total of 547 Regensburg damsels were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s, with "high plausibility" for their victims.
The final report states of Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "It is therefore clear that in many cases Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and mental violence.
Especially when the students were emotionally high, the punishment could be more severe.
However, unlike many other defendants, many victims appreciate R.'s general humanity and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him".
In the interview, Hesemann explains why he believes the final report on the abuse scandal at Regensburg's Domspatzen relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against protected persons in the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture by the cathedral chaplain Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity".
Second, he also appears as a cholerist and perfectionist, who became often handshake when a dom's spat did not bring top performance musically.
As his biographer, how do you rate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you're going to go through the effort and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you're going to have to ask yourself, why is Georg Ratzinger even in it?
He's only got eight pages dedicated to him and he's cleared of any suspicion of being an accomplice or a partner in the horrific sexual abuse cases.
The violence in preschool also took place outside its scope.
In any case, he can be accused of not being informed too late or of not taking his initial suggestions seriously enough.
The Domspatz Gymnasium, where he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "a better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students give an excellent witness, describing Georg Ratzinger as "warm-hearted", "beloved", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely kindly teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies, and candy and "always surrounded by children's grapes".
Only a minority complain about his perfectionism and high emotionality, which has led to outbursts of anger.
Not only did he bang chairs and throw the key rings on the floor, but he also gave earplugs and pulled too many cowardly boys by the hair or ears.
But to his credit, it must be said that in the 1960s and 1970s, such methods of education were widespread among parents and teachers.
Do you know any other methods of discipline?
Of course, I think all of us born before 1968.
I too have experienced this in a secular school, a public high school.
In comparison with what this report actually deals with, namely the horrific sexual abuse and violence rates in preschool, these are, of course, trivial.
You might wonder if it's more about his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media outlets are coming at him.
The Bavarian pope is still the work of many who have never understood him.
The truth is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way.
The report has been widely reported in the media on the abuse of the Domspatzen in Regensburg.
Does Georg Ratzinger also be charged with any involvement or knowledge in sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly not.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have confided in the chaplain.
Not even the parents were initiated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it", said one of the staff, "I was very embarrassed".
The real problem with the sexual abuse investigation was and still is that most victims keep quiet out of shame.
If they did not even trust their parents and siblings, certainly not a choirmaster who was, in a way, a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role in the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: One student interviewed put it this way: "As far as sexual abuse ... I don't see ... any case where he (Georg Ratzinger) could have just gotten the facts in time and stopped the perpetrator.
I think it's... it's also really absurd to assume that it's just him... that kids have been more intrusive or clearer or even more open than their parents, boarding school directors, trusted teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable".
The report concludes that "the fact that the students and/or their environment were confident in him in advance could not be confirmed in the investigation".
So as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be free of all knowledge.
It is also not possible to accuse him of not preventing or bringing him to the public.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these heinous crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
The media has been reading a lot about "violence excesses" among the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The report "Wegschauwing" accuses former cathedral chaplain Georg Ratzinger.
Does he have to live with that accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem, that in the reporting, everything was mixed up and mixed up into a huge mix of sexual abuse and violent incidents and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is exactly what the report is about.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council, which are in line with the Commission's proposals.
In addition, the report deals with incidents since 1945, i.e. four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choirmaster of the Domzspats.
The terrible beatings, the cases where boys were harassed and abused by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all took place at the Kindergarten in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But the chaplain Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, for he only saw the boys when they were already at the Domspatz Gymnasium.
As most Witnesses emphasize, the subject of "pre-school" was taboo.
One was merely happy to escape and enjoyed much better treatment and even "paradise" conditions for many.
What was different about Domspatz High?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but not sadistic violence.
And so is Georg Ratzinger, who concludes that "many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and, in many cases, even have positive memories of him despite violence".
The only thing left to blame is that we have looked away.
But despite all efforts, the report was only able to define two periods of time during which he was informed of conditions in preschool.
The first time was in 1970/71, when he was just starting to establish himself and he was not interested in the activities of a school where he was not involved and responsible, and then again in 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatz Gymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this regard, he points out that "the practice of the punishment of beating continues in the preschool".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was of course at a time when legal clarity was in place, when beatings were also long banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to assess where the victims might have exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he's always looked away.
It's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the beating penalty was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trap of anachronism", the danger of evaluating the past by today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this is not true of course of sexual abuse, which has always been abhorrent, nor of what was committed in preschool in the face of hostility and violence against innocent children, which goes far beyond what was common at the time.
This is all very terrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His methods of discipline and punishment, such as blowing his ears and pulling his hair and ears, were common in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg days did Georg Ratzinger give in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the question of punishment by beating also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, or Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, because the Domesday Book was only a side story.
I'm not going to hide the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But it must also be said that without this perfectionism, without the need for unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to have formed from the hitherto more nationally known Regensburg Domspatzen an institution of world class, a true cultural ambassador for Europe and its musical tradition, which toured twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and candy alone, you can make a rebellious boy not a great singer and stand before any success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-control.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger in the talks about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have really gotten to know Georg Ratzinger very well and I have repeatedly experienced him as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply religious, and heartfelt person, one cannot imagine that he could hurt even a fly.
I regularly get word that many former house spiders still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who have not forgiven him for being so harsh on them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the housewives today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a loving and respectful person to whom they look up to and worship today.
And please, be clear, all that is being accused of him are the methods of education that were common at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time.
But it's extremely unfair to make a man a media scapegoat just because he's prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
There's the evil intent behind it, just too obvious.
Because the report that just came out is relieving him.
Now decency would order a 93-year-old man who has earned great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburg Domspatzen to finally leave in peace.
