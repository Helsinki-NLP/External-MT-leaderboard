Its reputation as a place of wealth dates back to around 400 A.D. or as late as 1100 A.D.

Such children are called "feral" or abandoned children by society (often by their parents); in many cases, these children are abandoned by their parents when they become morally bankrupt or physically unable to do so.
Feral children have some basic skills such as sighting or facial recognition before being chased or fled.

There will also be an organization based on the mind that is slowly becoming more and more like a scaffolding that is slowly folding back.

Failure to do so can result in serious injury, premature death, and even death.
Often plants will produce vegetables that nourish the body, such as the leaves we eat, but these are too rare for us modern humans to eat.
