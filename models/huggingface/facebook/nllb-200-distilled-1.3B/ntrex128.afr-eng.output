Members of the Welsh Assembly worried they'd look like fools
There is consternation among some assembly members over the proposal to change their title from AMe to MWPe (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members across the political spectrum fear that it could provoke ridicule.
One Labour Party member says his group is concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means dumb and pwp means feces.
A Plaid Cymru party assemblyman says the group as a whole is "not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "receptive" to the name change, but noted that it is a "short leap in language from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or fool".
In this context the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: The final decision on any descriptions of what is called Assembly members will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that received broad support to name the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As for the AMe's title, the Commission chose Welsh Parliament Members of WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a public consultation.
The AM seems to be working on proposing alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the chair, Elin Jones, who is due to table a bill on the changes in weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the assembly's working method, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will have the final say in the question of what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly refused to accept its EU and NATO membership applications.
Macedonia's president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are going silent because churches in Harlem are going nuts.
"Historically, the old people I spoke to say, there was a bar and a church on every corner", says Mr. Adams.
"None of them are there today".
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize in different ways these days", he says.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood family rooms where people go regularly".
As for churches, he worries that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be right back where they started".
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the kind of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of people buying units in these buildings will be white", he says, "and will therefore bring even closer the day when these churches will be completely closed, because most of the people moving into these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930's.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the building's title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who would not hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
The Hon. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been unfolding at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council, the governing body of the congregation, which consists of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese was "trying to pass on the costs" to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complain about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old at lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he dived for lobster on the first day of the California lobster season, officials say.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then rowed with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the thrill of a first lobster catch, but then he realized 'that he was screaming, 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!'
His whole clavicle was torn open", Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
"I called out for everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Life-saving captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had sustained traumatic injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand into UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams are fighting back with department store-style beauty salons staffed by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion of the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and homewares slump, the larger beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if successful will be taken to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty is taking place as supermarkets look for ways to replenish shelves once used for TVs, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will include brand names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing lines of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique make-up line so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that is being insisted upon by an increasing number of younger shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London and a second which will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a shift to smaller amounts of food bought daily from local convenience stores mean that supermarkets must do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that the stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and nonfood products from the discount stores Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also launched a number of Habitat outlets since buying both chains two years ago, which they say has boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship was terminated after an argument over how the profits from the pharmacies should be divided within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills- Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.
Our range of brand names is designed to meet every need and the enticing environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a commanding beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones walked away "in a rage" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled her out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their home-clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The This Morning presenter, 37, announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing at the last minute from their lucrative lifestyle brand business - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when TV's golden girl announced at a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that her new opportunities - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she could no longer spend enough time on their home-clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have doubled Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune, according to insiders.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones got on a jet and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
One source says: "Truly was Holly's top priority by far.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely stunned all involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the withdrawal of This Morning, one of Britain's biggest money-making stars, could cost the firm millions because of the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to lighting and homewear, and the possibility that its launch could be delayed even further.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business dealings".
Tough words 'and then we fall in love'
He scoffed at the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
said Trump in his kamma "newsreader" voice.
"I gave up nothing".
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "consistent response" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament activities, more than three months after the June leaders' summit in Singapore.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. is continuing with sanctions designed to keep the pressure on.
Trump took a much more optimistic approach in his rally speech.
"We are making excellent progress with North Korea", he said".
"We were on the verge of starting a war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship".
He says that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - it has ended rocket tests, helped free hostages, and brought home the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to describing relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have almost 200 people just standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tide and earthquake in Indonesia devastate island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been uprooted, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they are not asking for international help, which makes it a little difficult", Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the constant earthquake that Indonesia endures, the country remains woefully ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning was in effect.
Traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging at best.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's battered infrastructure a focus of his election campaign and spent lavishly on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is plagued by funding shortfalls as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from mounting sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought with cutlery, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons in the streets.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks a good equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri reported for Sturridge when he was about 30 yards out of Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0 down.
He tapped the ball to the left before kicking far to the goalpost.
The attempt sailed high over the frame as it floated to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball bumped over a leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get in that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I just tried to create as much time for myself as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I tapped once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked".
Chelsea were 1-0 up at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goalkeeper played back to Mateo Kovacic in that area with a back kick before he rolled close to midfield and slammed into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic was quick to receive and pass in midfield.
With a beautiful forward kick, he then led Hazard into the frame.
Hazard passed the defence and finished in the back of the net with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will take on Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 3pm.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
Indonesian tsunami kills 832 people
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Numerous people were reportedly trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday, causing boulders up to 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after wife stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7.55am at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who heard or saw anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages but I appeal to anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam footage, to contact us as they may have information that may be essential for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman showed up at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continuing as police said they are in the process of notifying the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now being told it will take hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard to tell one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
She kept saying, "It's so horrible".
At 2pm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officers were left inside the cordon to monitor the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to call @MerPolCC at DM, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 dated 30 September as a reference.
Cromwell's Statute of Parliament becomes the latest memorial to the "rewrite of history" controversy
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so much of England's cultural and religious art objects by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statutes that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The storming of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure many believe to be still memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate depiction is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
Killer Pig Ripens Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname, Yuan, was found dead with a blood-stained, torn skull near a cage at a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his nephew found him dead and found the door to a neighboring pigsty open.
He said there was a big male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation reportedly confirmed that the 550-pound pig had bitten the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and torn", said the cousin, named after his surname, Wu, the Guiyang Evening News quoted.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that the man killed did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities negotiated alleged compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After being eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Oregon told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "sniffer".
They're just playing.
They're little, they're very curious... they don't mean you any harm.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect", he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring floodwaters across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the days ahead.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, beginning at 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough across the Pacific Ocean begins to form and move eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to push heavy tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in response to the approaching trough, tropical humidity will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, waste flows, and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will produce rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour from place to place, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially over large parts of Arizona.
Flash floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the diffuse nature of tropical rain.
It would be most unwise to venture out into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain may cause deep ravines to hit wild rivers, and thunderstorms will bring strong local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Rainfall totals of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth rip currents.
This will be the region's first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rainfall becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October may see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central United States is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the lingering summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to start warm in October, with widespread 80's from the Southern Lowlands to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks Thursday the poignant testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-nap turn: a deal brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had drunkenly attacked her and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
More than 20.4 million people likely watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it hard to measure people looking in offices.
To put it in perspective, that's an audience the size of a deciding football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose viewers strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS Friday morning with protesters yelling at him as he tried to take a lift to a Judiciary Committee.
He stood for several minutes with his eyes downcast while CNN vividly filmed him being maligned.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
It was said to him, "You have power whereas many women are powerless".
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and walked out the elevator door, saying that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered live hours later when the Judiciary Committee would vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate by a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the candidate for the next week, as the Democratic minority requested.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK EM May accuses critics of 'political games' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political play" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May appears at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside the one with her on the front page, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should levy each other's tariffs was "totally ridiculous".
Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken into custody on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the scuffle.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanks territorial law enforcement for its zeal and pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time", Wayde said.
Volcano spits ash on Mexico City
Ash spewed from the Popocatepeti volcano reached the southern outskirts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater picked up and 183 releases of gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple thunderstorms and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gas covering car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude-7.1 earthquake ripped through central Mexico in September 2017.
Known as Don Goyo, the volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote commemoration
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined counter-protests to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by riot police, were bombarded with eggs and powdered paint, which caused dark dust clouds to form in streets usually crowded with tourists.
A brawl also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their batons to keep the brawl under control.
For several hours pro-independence groups chanted in unison No forgetting, no forgiveness in confrontation with the unionists' cry of Long live Spain.
Fourteen people have received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the marches, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent but turnout was low, with those against secession largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite a crucial but nail-biting victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-imposed exile or in custody in the front row for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he will stand in next year's European Parliament elections.
Candidating for the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government, he said.
London: Men arrested after driving home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at around 19:30 BST on Thursday in Ballynagardsingel.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.

Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures victory
Livigston's promotion stunned Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to manage the Ibrox club until just his second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal proved the difference as Gary Holt's team moved into second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side have remained unbeaten in the Premier League this season and face the frontrunners Heart next week, who are eight points ahead.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends their undefeated run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still undefeated since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost chances against bot visitors
Holt's side should have gone ahead long before they scored a goal, with their round-breastedness causing Rangers all sorts of problems.
SR broke through but curled up in front of the goal, so AL could only play wide after he got closer and met CH's headstand across the goal.
The hosts were content to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with dead-game moments.
And so came the decisive goal.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson together giving Menga the chance to kick and score from the middle of the frame.
By this point, Rangers had dominated possession but could not penetrate the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a turn by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow scored wide to avoid still-open play from Livingston.
Crosses repeatedly reached and returned Livingston's frame, while two penalties were thrown out after Halkett's challenge from substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
 Livingston's phenomenal  analysis of the world
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and results for Livingston.
Up to the last man was excellent; they still exceeded expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and manhood have remained virtually unchanged since their return to the top flight, but Holt deserves a lot of credit for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was gigantic with his magnificent defensive lineup while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and they could only penetrate the home team once, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, who are in the middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies Saturday (September 29) as leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was supposed to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a falling out over issues that included human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering outside the mosque but many supporters showed up to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters  many of them Kurds  also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The struggling demonstrations reflect the divisiveness of a visitor who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and branded an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present but the man died at the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident happened.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his relatives.
Roadblocks and bus diversions are in place, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a maximum-security men's prison, the prison office said.
Rioting broke out around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist Tornado guards were called in to deal with the riot, which included eight prisoners and was confined to one wing.
The guards were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may be kept behind bars longer.
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the prison's chief warden was receiving hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October riot police were called in to address a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flash Floods (Dry Areas May Benefit) Hurricane Rosa is a major storm in the Gulf of Mexico
It's unusual for a tropical depression to hit Arizona but that's exactly what could happen early next week if Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwestern desert, bringing flash flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching with rain late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border".
National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the American Southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside the flash flood risk, Rosa's rain will likely be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, only about 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category", weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to landfall across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and is therefore losing its strength.
So it is expected to make landfall Monday afternoon or evening in a tropical storm-force area of Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move northward over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression in the early morning hours of Tuesday and then move through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger expected from Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest", said the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that this rain could cause life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found around 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials called on anyone who might have any cell phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered from the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered from the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about her claim.
The president said Saturday that Americans saw that day "the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most capable legal minds of our time, a jurist with a clean record of public service", he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but actually I'm standing", he said.
That is why I fight for these candidates everywhere".
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds dead from Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with numbers still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when giant waves broke on beaches as a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu for a beach party on Friday when fires up to six meters (18 feet) high broke on the beach at sunset, washing many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it swept cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency show numerous buildings and shops destroyed, bridges that twisted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks shook the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's tremor was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have aggravated the magnitude of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable", saying thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the epicenter.
Communication "is completely blocked with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it could get much worse", they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media can be heard of a man on the top floor of a building shouting desperate warnings of the coming tsunami to people down the street.
Within minutes a wall of water hits the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused major power outages that cut communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened for relief efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to more than 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu city, where workers are sheltering in canopy shelters set up in their office yard, they passed scenes of destruction on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me that they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's very bad.
Even as relief groups begin the grueling task of getting the relief effort underway, some people complained that foreign relief workers with extensive experience are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies and personnel from overseas can only be brought in once the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can open it up to international assistance, but it doesn't have a status yet".
As the second night on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami dawns, friends and family of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national skating team, has been training two of the missing skater for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Still others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachute weaving field, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recounts how, in the hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse circulated on social media among the parachute community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who were participating in the beach party.
However, his messages were answered with only one gray check mark, instead of two blue check marks.
"I think it means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from an ATM at Newport on the Levee.
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name  to Ye
Announcing the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new all-star Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grande on the show, which was canceled for "emotional reasons", the show's producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye  just reflecting our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are".
He is one of a number of well-known rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, among other names, but announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love this year.
A former West employee, Jay-Z, also did well with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians in the run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday to "never, ever use the military to control the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking hold throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities are attracting youths to gangs.
US needs to double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in that field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the US government made AI announcements, even though the US lacks an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced their plan last year: they aim to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next major AI breakthrough being achieved in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest rated American Othello player and later was a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged past U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge, and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking away the academic leaders; it's the corporate bosses", Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired influential people from other universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee says changes in immigration policy could also help to support U.S. AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to PhDs in AI", he said.
China's State Council issued their Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a joint AI center that aims to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has come under fire for months.
Macedonians vote in election whether country name should change
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an action that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked its membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to territory and has denied them admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price to pay to pursue admission for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide it.
The name change will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
But turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small porch and pulled chairs closer in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Eurasian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" vote would be "a confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum  less than the required amount.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A reversal in the referendum would be the first serious setback to the policies of a pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through the entire Brighton defence for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cleared the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received a touchdown in midfield at the start of the series.
He chased through three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton goal-line.
He then pushed a lever to the left, where he found Sterling.
The England forward used his first cage touch to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to kick Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We are happy that he scored a goal at that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League struggle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep into the Brighton area on that play.
He sent a beautiful ball past the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touches before leading Sterling to the far corner of the goal.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net just before he crossed the back line.
City take on Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 pm at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least earned a promoter spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still want to clinch their first division title.
"Although we're playing for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level from any point I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be a part of it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting player for Sunday but are reportedly in favor of having Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, had a pitching practice Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rallies in West Virginia
The president made an indirect reference to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetimes.
It's one of the big, big  I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing and that's why I'm fighting everywhere for these candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
And they are now determined to take back power by any means possible, you see the meanness, the cunning.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and power, we're not going to give it to them".
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
"And one sees it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and sneaky and false".
He referred to the name of Senate Judiciary Committee staffer Dianne Feinstein, who received a loud cheer from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for one  that was really poor body language  the weakest body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant of those who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was not exactly a surprise.
After all, I am the last person in a string of Labour MPs who has been told we are not welcome  all because we said what we thought.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment for her fearless stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, this was exactly what AR meetings were on Friday nights.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of "friendlier, more favorable" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on its acceptability to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed to  whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public  and it doesn't really matter what I say  there's a tirade of slurs on social media asking not to be re-elected, dismissing politics from the core and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments made to me tend to be political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shrink away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of abuse have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week argued that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every "motion of distrust" or change in selection rules, the party grows nervous.
I have had a lot of advice over the past two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not be so outspoken, and then be "okay".
But that is not why I entered politics.
Since joining the Labour Party as a scholar 32 years ago, spurred on by the Thatcher government's neglect of my public high school, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my policy positions and areas where I differed from the current leadership.
To those who voted in favour of the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country heading for a Brexit that will hurt all our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, whether their members are now Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political gain will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr above
Two late threes may have skewed the final score slightly, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the points table, the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We have so far been tested in our matches and we are still unbeaten, so I must be happy", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "To Ayr, they took their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, scored by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, who was made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to have the numbers counted and Jason Baggot scored an unassailable three.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before he, just before halftime, missed a solo three to make it halftime 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's three, scored by Baggot, cut the gap to five points.
There was a long delay for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott who was brought down on a portable, and from the restart Ayr extended the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, blunted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unassisted three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of very busy play.
The home side made a comeback and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for taking Climo without the ball, and from the penalty spot, MacPherson pushed the ball to death behind the approaching Ayr loose.
Climo missed, as he did almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe scored David Armstrong's goal and sent Gregor Henry away from the flank for the home team's fifth three.

The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it seems that Kiernan is getting ready for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's landlocked country hopes court will reopen road to Pacific
Sailors patrol a mesh-covered naval barracks in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are plastered with the slogan: "The sea is rightfully ours.
It is a duty to get it back".
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is as fresh  as the need to sail the Pacific again.
That hope is probably the highest it has been in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on October 1, after 5 years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and naturally expects the outcome with a positive attitude", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the IGH ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia's claim that  after decades of sporadic negotiations  Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president  who faces a controversial re-election battle next year  also has a lot to decide on Monday's ruling.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court's decision in Bolivia's favor is unlikely  and that little will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the IRH ruling comes just six months after the last hearing shows that the case "was not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", said Zárate.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric tapped into any remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold such talks.
The last time the two countries exchanged ambassadors was in 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was extremely swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of differences for mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales  still one of Latin America's most popular presidents  uses the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless their U.S. can be trusted
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honor the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rival countries.
His remarks follow US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently on the verge of resuming nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a deadlock, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream picture" that continued sanctions and US capture of a declaration that ended the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking meaningful steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal it views as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest range of large headgear on its way to stores near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or to avoid the sun altogether, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a range of oversized headgear to their SS19 collection on the runway that captured the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have been flooding Instagram this summer, and these designers have paraded their mind-blowing creations on the catwalk.
The highlight of Valentino's work was an oversized beige hat with a feathery wide brim that swallowed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons decorated with jewels, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple  but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had embroidered lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like scuba gear, including a snorkel and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you're going to continue the big fashion show, this is your lucky day.
Fashionistas predict that the huge hats may be on their way to stores near you.
The oversized hats follow briefly the heels of "La Bomba", the two-foot-wide-brimmed straw hat seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult-like etiquette behind the highly impractical hat, which was spread across social media, sent another great creation across the aisle  a straw-strand bag almost as big as the swimsuit model who wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia strips and a white leather handle on top, stood out in Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Renowned stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer  as the designer has made such an impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a string of achievements of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sport, the arts, music and other community enterprises.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their position as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see world languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart".
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of scholars who studied foreign languages received an A above grade.
The data, collected from SCIS' 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students scored an upper A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 of those studying French, and 63 of those studying Spanish also scored an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now have the same status as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Occupations and Skills found that 17 percent of the reasons given by employees for their difficulty filling jobs were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, learning a second language will give them a real advantage in the future with such a life-long skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to engage in conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is now so important to invest in language education for today's children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still hugely important for the future of the country, and therefore should be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
We must do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut Sunday for the San Diego Lakers.
The wait is almost over for fans to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But exactly how many minutes he will play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited amount of time.
After a practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games to get ready at this point in my career", he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently withheld for his choice to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when voting begins in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can one watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live below.
Trump is likely to attend this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become strained over sexual misconduct allegations with an expected confirmation vote held back for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of these over-rallies is to help the Republicans who face a difficult election in November.
So President Trump's campaign said these five rallies next week are aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for the Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the media in Pittsburgh", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing according to the polling patterns.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come to the polls to give him a boost", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage in the fight to keep hope alive as they enter Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's four-player teams may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing of momentum is a thoroughly refined sporting concept but one that players believe in wholeheartedly, and certainly in competitions like this one.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"They were six points ahead and now it's four, so we're carrying that as a little bit of momentum, I guess", Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points ahead and 12 to play.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is much to cheer them on, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was lethal from the whip to the clean field and led by example.
That score of cheers grew louder as his round progressed and he sank a critical set to win Game Four evenly with him and Thomas trailing by two after two rounds.
His teammates who won the game for them at 15 were greeted with a similar shout, the kind that tells you that he believes the American team still has a chance.
"You really just have to get it all out and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
That's all those players have left now.
18 holes to make their mark.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup story.
Europe's single but charming couple got four out of four and can do no wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple to record no traffic lights on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided traffic lights on Saturday morning as well as during the last nine Friday mornings.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this lavish crowd, confirms that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time or at different pits.
However, it is still too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short cuts with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he played alongside Alex Noren.
One hold over the lead and two doubles on the top nine landed the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they could hardly get out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The foursomes and foursomes are so exciting to watch up close because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has always been better as a team, taking a significant lead on the final day, but this four-game session also showed that the U.S. team has the courage to fight a fight that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming from a 10-6 lead in Saturday's four-ball and four-game series.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that had performed unevenly in the morning's four balls, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. put up more resistance in the fours and won two games, but they did not let the gap narrow.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points after their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they played together to defeat a father Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, has sometimes shown flashes of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning foursomes, returned to play with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third in the world rankings.
On a pleasant, breezy day southwest of Paris, Europe did not always get their way, however.
Jordan Spieth, who won three major championships, and Justin Thomas set the American record on Saturday with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 3&4 in the four-ball after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team recovered from a four-point gap when entering the singles, although Furyk's team only had to tie to retain the trophy because they already hold it.
However, after two days of second best, they do not look like they will manage a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will 'definitely not' unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are deepening their distrust of the United States and that the country will certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons without such characteristics.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "meaningful goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the United States", he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not unilaterally disarm first".
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament that would reward North Korea if it took gradual steps, his words seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament unconditionally as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim pledged to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists on 'destruction of nuclear weapons first' and is putting more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve its goal in a compelling way, even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can force us to our knees is a dream of people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our distrust".
Ri did not say anything about plans for a second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader drew attention to earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings over the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, adding: "If the party in this nuclear destruction issue were South Korea and not the United States, the destruction of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end".
Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year, however, when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missiles would inevitably be aimed at the US mainland after "Mr. Bad President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, lavished praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still needed to be done and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea destroyed its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue diligently and without interruption until we achieve the complete, final, verified destruction of nuclear weapons".
The Security Council has been unanimously tightening sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to dry up funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but just hours later North Korea accused him of making "gang demands".
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "corresponding measures".
He said Kim told him that the "compliant measures" he wants to see are security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is getting all its undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to counter the growing macho culture of studying through caffeinated "all-nights sessions".
One academic found that students at the world's top university are often ignorant of the basics of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was - which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time that year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how they improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course involves some interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dormitory where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes, and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that this will not change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in 'studying all night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students have meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough good-quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to avoid stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even weight gain, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, leaving you feeling hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: goal from Menga defeats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another heartbreaking day when Dolly Menga's goal scorer beat Steven Gerrard's uneven team 1-0.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first win as visitors since February's 4-1 defeat at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side conceded Gerrard just his second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind Hearts, who were leading the Ladbrokes Premiership by a wide margin.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and it didn't look like a Rangers team would play even without a lot of inspiration.
While Rangers now fall to sixth position, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be further trouble for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence was treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown from the side of the road.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the Betfred Cup final.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been in awe of the way his well-trained team strangled their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They should have scored after just two minutes when Menga's first serve sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder took his big chance.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found captain Craig Halkett but his defender Alan Lithgow could only miss the back post.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have scored a penalty at the quarter-point when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get just two shots on target during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was badly bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a soft goal by Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener in the 34th minute may have been against the direction of play, no one can deny that they deserved it, if only for their hard work.
Once again, Rangers failed to handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple round.
Gerrard came on at halftime when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the trade had an almost immediate impact as the wing sent for Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his line to the block.
But Livingston kept forcing the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett catching long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have extended their lead in the final stages, but McGregor rose up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could enter wide from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and OUR COUNTING FURTHER... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a mainstay of science, and it has also become a mainstay in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", which starred those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Gee, it's cracking right about now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to 'see' predator cells
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to 'see' and kill predator cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to identify predator cells as part of treatment
Method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to many cancers and inject it back.
A test substance is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify predatory cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "drives the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West began with a pro-Trump tease after his appearance on SNL, while wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was cheered in the studio during a Saturday Night Live performance after a lengthy performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great-hat, he lashed out at the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago", he said.
SNL opened the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, footage of West's fight was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West by posting it.
West also complained to the audience that he was made difficult by what he wore on his head backstage.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on".
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a low place", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Would you like to see the low point?" and said that he would put on his "superman cloak, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love".
His comments drew cheers from the audience at least twice and members of the SNL cast looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The whole studio went dead silent".
West was introduced as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rhyming chatterbox Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE MASS".
But chat host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "who he is and that's absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") anyone who I believe embraces and promotes an ideology that endangers my community.
He's free.
We too", she added.
Before the show, the rhyming chatterbox announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the being formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rhyming chatterbox, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince changed his name to n symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity in the film
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such on-screen roles mean that young boys often feel they must be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture, saying he believed "something went wrong" and asked how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "fairly strong" about working on this issue.
'I personally feel pretty strongly about it right now - where did we go wrong with manhood?' he said.
'What have our husbands learned as they grow up about the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity because of its highly masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is learned?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because something obviously went wrong with our young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be participating in any of the Game of Thrones prequels and sequels when the series ends next summer, saying he is "done with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones was meeting his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this show, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the site of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials say.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which represents a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmission of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to make the case.
Maxine Waters denies a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, condemns 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters spoke out on Saturday against allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were driven by "ultra-right" pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill during the Senate panel hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of this fraudulent and false claim - was not responsible for the leak of this information in any way.
This baseless claim is utterly untrue and an absolute lie".
Waters' statement prompted criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger", wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He should not be defiant.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must be calm and quiet".
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being seemingly too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to get Waters out of the midterms, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office "has notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the caregivers are exposed", she continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for anything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again review - paralyzed Rowan Atkinson spy pottery
It is now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new film with a British twist and this seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy spotter franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and struggled further in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obviously power we are be the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, the clumsy Johnny English with his spots and rubber face has renewed his license to screw up for the second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation to non-English-speaking movie audiences.
He's, of course, the derided secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretence of sophisticated elegance, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a good shot of that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He was also originally based on the traveller and international man of mysteries, leaving chaos behind him, whom Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard commercials.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest version of JE.
I liked Johnny English walking up to a helicopter wearing a medieval suit of armor, briefly hammering the screw blades against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display but the humor feels rather bland and oddly redundant, especially when the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now use comedy with confidence as an ingredient themselves.
The humor feels like it's aimed at kids rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's misadventures aren't as original and focused as Atkinson's silent movie jokes in the persona of Bean.
The enduring thematic assumption now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, much to the chagrin of the agent in charge - a pitiful little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a Prime Minister who is a bloated and besieged character who is already experiencing a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Teresa May character but there's very little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been compromised, she must call someone from retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some fancy institution, but who, by the way, is teaching classes on how to be a secret agent, there are some cool jokes here when English is teaching a School of Rock-type espionage class.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency mission and is reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a bit of a stuntman in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
So the Batman and Robin are completely out of Her Majesty's Secret Service completely back on duty and they come down on Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister finds himself under the dangerous spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the enigmatic Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey with ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, causing chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English unleashes sheer anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
Nothing is spared for that last scene, but as cute and lavish as it may be, the whole affair is quite a bit like children's TV.
Pretty mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Couldn't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really brought out his talent?
Labour denies it is devising a plan for the British to work a four-day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that would make Britons work four days a week - but get paid for five.
The party claims that company-based savings caused by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution should be passed on to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This will allow workers to enjoy a three-day week - but they will still take home the same pay.
Sources say it will "fit" the party's economic agenda and plans to put the country in the hands of the workers.
The change to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day workweek during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the ambition is not currently endorsed by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not party policy and is not being considered by the party".
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to weigh in on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power away from "faceless directors" and "profiteers" in service companies.
The Shadow Minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back as a Labour government can make 'deductions' based on alleged infringement.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private sector companies to employees, who can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings can convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Sen. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could elaborate on anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Did you do this?
He was determined, decisive, unambiguous".
Graham's voice, however, seems to be unchanging.
"I have formed my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has been in earnest denial", Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I see nothing new changing".
What is World Citizens' Day, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizens' Day, an annual music event that features a particularly impressive group of performing stars and has an equally impressive purpose: ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens' Day will draw tens of thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event's true purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Day, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years left to reach his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, World Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, supporting a multitude of different causes.
It says these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid out or raised.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, following more than 5,000 actions taken to reach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on his website asking "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
World Citizen replied: "It's going to be a long and hard road - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US may use navy for "blockades" to stop Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
"If necessary", Washington can rely on its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as energy brokers just like in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe", he allegedly said.
And, according to one official, there are ways and means to address this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and if necessary, to blockade, to make sure their energy doesn't end up on the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing the audience at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that considers itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are virtually the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel", he said, referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The rulings come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including American President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says makes Berlin Moscow's "prisoner".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view provoked a backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
At a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the highest level of sport", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren expressed her opinion of President Donald Trump during the town meeting, saying he was "taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was very vocal in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
A poll released Thursday showed a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The poll showed more support for the idea of former Governor Deval Patrick standing, with 38 percent supporting the idea of him potentially standing and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed for possible 2020 nominations include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin named Track Palin's PTSD at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested Monday night and charged with one count of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he's been going through since he came back, I sympathize with other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the trauma our soldiers are returning with", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little different, they come back tough, they come back wondering if there's respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a domestic violence complaint and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District filed a friend-of-the-court legal brief in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been made public.
She says her partner "and his violent gangbangers", abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, as nations facing deep problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such advocacy violates that policy", said the friend-of-the-court legal order.
Lawyers further argued in the subpoena that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy and says it makes them more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems  even all the serious problems  that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in search of survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly grim.
"It feels very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching through flooded possessions, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's army hospital where patients are being treated outside due to persistent severe aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he recounts the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the rubble of the walls, I think", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe".
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ad'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily praising the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily's paid insert in the Des Moines Register  Iowa's best-selling newspaper  last Wednesday after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections,  a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war that has led to them levelling off tariff barriers on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now exacerbating the bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government is seizing America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing, one will find very limited dissenting voices and not see any true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has shunned the offer to publish his article", though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women voters ahead of midterm Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
As many top Republicans stand by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of multiple sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned they will see backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
Emotions are running high, and most Republicans on record have already indicated they want to go ahead with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Ariz.) call for an FBI investigation at the last minute will be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday  they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they debated in the Senate lobby as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high", Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it was already high; it is true.
But it may be higher, especially among swing-wing women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who do not often vote because they do not like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her sexual assault allegation against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said a backlash could follow if Republicans go ahead with the confirmation.
"It's become a mess for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem somewhat divided over who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with slightly more siding with the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh likely or definitely joked during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake's urging, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her when he was 17 years old while drunk.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee scoffed that the idea with Inrupt is "world domination".
"We need to do it now", he said of the project.
"This is a historic moment".
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and in one browser.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal data empowerment".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We do not ask their permission".
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victorian Clergyman celebrated
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns".
He later rushed to the line of fire and led the line forward with "great courage" before single-handedly charging a field gun and knocking out three of the division.
Lt. Kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do standing up, but something that is humiliating".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid wreaths after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by a lot of people".
MMA fans stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night watching the packed Bellator 206, only to miss the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, including six on the main show that would air live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to tell each other the fight, viewers in the UK were stunned when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying up late for the fight.
One supporter described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "some kind of sick joke".
"It's government policy that the content at 6pm was not appropriate and so they had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig", yes.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the rebroadcast, I think we can probably work something out", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were a lot of texts going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We're going to limit it to five fights instead of six -- as we normally do -- and we've tried to offer more to our fans and just go about our time.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality but it gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said that it was not until he entered high school that he realized that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was venting his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning at the Olympics.
The longtime regular host of the program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of illness.
When he appeared as a rejectionist on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, those feelings of inferiority and different feeling are the real things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He says that he has vented his feelings because he is so happy to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said falling in love with US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "took him by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age"  he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later  he said it was hard to find someone of his age who had similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley says his "entire perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was about 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares his name with his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012  because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of my home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first song selection  Proud by Heather Small  who also resonated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gives him chicken.

Mickelson out of the race and out of Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to get in shape to prevent it from becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, playing for a record 12th time in the biennial event, was ejected by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball and four-number games.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will split his day between being a race leader and working on his game at the practice bench in the hope of fixing what is wrong.
Even at the peak of his career, he was never the most straightforward driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long roughness always punishes the wandering punches.
And as if the track itself wasn't challenging enough, Mickelson will face the reigning British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth match on Sunday, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, get off to a good start in the 12 singles matches, Mickelson's match could be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me, and said he would be fine tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I had more in mind, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be on the track just like anyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really matched the highlights of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk has said his presence has contributed intangible aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's witty, he likes to shave the crap out of you, and he's a great guy to have in the team room", he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him, which was fun to watch.
He offers so much more than just play".
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows a big lead could soon be gone.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the final day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team, led by Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead but won only by a nail-biting 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we scratched the nail", Bjorn said, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
You're going full speed ahead tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we also know who's on the other side, the best players in the world".
Rejoicing over how his players performed on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never get ahead of myself with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it's the individual contest that comes up, and it's a horse of a different color.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message you have to give to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind and he has to make the best of himself too".
Unlike Bjorn, his peer Jim Furyk will want his players to do better individually than they did as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself had been on both sides of that great final-day turnaround, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up as the loser as Europe achieved the "miracle of Medina".
"I remember every word of it", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had encouraged his players on the way to that final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to start well, like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.
When that momentum starts going in one direction, it puts a lot of strain on those middle matches.
We organized our team accordingly and we sorted out the men who we felt, you know, would bring us something magical tomorrow".
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and came up against Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I chose this group of guys in this order because I think it covers it to the end", Bjorn said of his singles choices.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The German army's newest frigate was due to enter service in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reports.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
This vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battle array of air defense and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods  it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home.
But continuing delays mean that the advanced warships  that will apparently enable Germany to project power overseas  will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The disastrous F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" render the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software flaws are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship is drastically overweight, reducing performance and reducing the Fleet's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project  including the training of the crew  also touched on an issue.
It apparently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - more than the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems afflicting the new frigates are especially important in light of recent warnings that the power of Germany's fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy's "deployable ships are running out".
The official said that the issue has worsened over time, as old ships have been decommissioned but no replacement vessels have been provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research is being conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and super-midget bats as well as the brown langur and Daubenton bats at Invereve Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld indicators.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will check the frequency of the bat calls and determine which species are doing so.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as grazing and how to best manage forest land for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects their sleeping places and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can flypaper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-orientation technique to point out bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys and sleeping inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats", he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still so much about bats that is unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to better understand what they need to thrive".
He stresses the need to search for bats before doing maintenance on properties because it is possible that unintentional destruction of a single nursery could result in the deaths of up to 400 females and young and wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or interfere with them or destroy their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations fare.
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed rape allegations against him as "fake news" and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel that published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the posts as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no. I was just going to say,
What they said today, fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they called, according to Reuters, "unacceptable reporting of privacy suspicions".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for any amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident, saying he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who was abandoned by the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had the hospital take pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault and moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK will 'regret forever' if its carmakers lose
The UK "will regret it forever" if it loses its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would have to temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need an agreement", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant  which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis  produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what automakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on an "on-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production will be halted.
Mr Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those border checks".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that, as I say, will allow us not only to enjoy the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The indications from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers as well, are that we absolutely need to continue with what has been a hugely successful set of supply chains.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that added costs in the long run could reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is Unite's plant summoner, says that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed by another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a tape recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid reports that he was on his way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would "rather not" resign for Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate bench trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for it has not yet been set, it could be this week, I can see it being postponed by another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed".
Some journalists will disagree: Sanders has not held a White House briefing since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of briefings was not due to a dislike of TV journalists who were "effect-oriented", though she said, "I won't argue with the fact that they are effect-oriented".
She hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, adding without citing evidence: "We looked at the numbers".
Briefings will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot in the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a random and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of gathered journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wishes for them to stay on after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MP sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed them to cover the costs of processing status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, leading to expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond, bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would very much like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before recess.
"He came to the sidelines and kind of just collapsed there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sidelines before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "no details yet on the type/ extent of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He took five shots on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters.
The stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year  to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK  with the extra cash to be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp duty increase will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money helping to fuel government plans to tackle homelessness.
The surcharge  beyond the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on second homes and homes purchased for rent  can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to bring in up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the door.
Many affluent areas of the country  especially in the capital  have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high by grabbing land but not using it and encouraged Mrs. May to forgo quotas on affordable housing to recover from Britain's "housing disaster".
Mr Corbyn has announced a striking series of planned housing improvements, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would devote my prime ministership to restoring the British dream  that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right that it is as easy for non-UK individuals as for foreign-based companies to buy homes as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness too great a reality.
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The Scot, 42, is enjoying the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East side, who are currently third in League One, three points below the relegation zone.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I made the second team, but that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I often watched Scotland at Hampden with my father as a child and this is something that pulls me back.
However, the opportunity can only come if I am successful in club management".
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin ONeill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no anxiety about following such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me will be measured by 'can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it definitely belongs in the Premier League", he said.
"It is not an easy task to get it there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could get the club out there again".
Ross's managerial career lasted only three years, following a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third tier and convert St Mirren from on the verge of relegation to Championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he says, recalling taking over Alloa's reins.
"I really believed management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds strange, because I did well enough, made a decent living out of it, and had decent highs.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things that one has to go through weekly.
I keep going through it in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it, it feels the most comfortable I've ever been in my own skin in my entire adult life".

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, survey finds.
The summer heat wave has boosted the revenues of Britain's struggling pubs but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July  but restaurant receipts were down 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous month, June, when drinking establishments were up 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Drink-led bars and pubs fared better and rose more than restaurants fell.
Food-driven drinking establishments also suffered from the sun, but not as badly as restaurant operators
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Across managed bars and drinking establishments, sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, with food laundering down three percent.
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM, said: These results continue the trend we have seen since late April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales will be especially difficult on top of continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-guided operators and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring the necessary relief.
Total sales growth across bars and restaurants, including new locations opening, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand awareness.
The Coffer Peach Tracker business sales monitor for the UK drinking establishment, pub and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 industry groups, with combined revenues of over £9 billion and is the established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children  some as young as 11  have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers  a survey reveals
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Insta pages
The news raised fears of sexual content being posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main account" to show their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news raised fears that sexual content was being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main" account to show their parents, but they also had private accounts.
One mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager who was urging others to rape her.
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot track them.
Eilidh Doyle will be voting for athletes at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
Eilidh is highly respected throughout the Scottish, UK and global athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the board, said Beattie.
Doyle said: I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and hope I can really contribute and help to lead the sport in Scotland.
The American, who has the 200-meter and 400-meter at the 1996 Atlanta Games among his four Olympic gold medals, is now a regular BBC pundit, unable to walk after suffering a brief ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell if and to what extent I would recover.
It was exhausting work, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and am doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!
Breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows divides opinions online
A breast pump company shared opinions online with an ad comparing breast-feeding mothers to milking cows.
To celebrate the launch of what has been called "the world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie  released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom the pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to the tune of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see my tail" and, "In case you haven't seen, those aren't udders, those are my breasts".
The chorus part is, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
But the ad posted on the firm's Facebook page caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed response from viewers, with many saying it understates the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Because we have to impregnate and give birth to them in order to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth", wrote one.

Another commented: "Reasonably traumatic for mother and baby.
But yeah, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can hold their babies?"
Another added: "The ad is so emotional".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "crazy" to her.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I had continued to breast-feed.
Milking made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product", wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad for moms who are milking (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feeling like 'cows.'
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is dead silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a feeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while they are weaning.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a big and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who milk and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the process of milking and all its challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining way that people can relate to the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has made the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the fierce rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration that make it harder to place children in foster care.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants, fearing that their own ability to stay in the country would be jeopardized by stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested thousands of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are here illegally and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we continue to prosecute those individuals", said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates say those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs of a child struggling are more easily overlooked because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "dealt with accordingly".
They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions, he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more uprooted, is "almost over".
He said that Damascus would continue to fight this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France with over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed some Western countries for spreading irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns, he said.
They're politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has repelled a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, home to three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who would be "eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win reelection in 2020 unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, a state of blame and scandal ends his presidency early.
In what will undoubtedly be the most dramatic finale of any presidency ever!
To date, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, peak viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show tops cable viewing with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand", says Neal Baer, program director of the ABC drama Designated Survivor about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
To eliminate is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond just being an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour of it watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin jacket and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he feeds you something every night", says Brent Montgomery, chief operating officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's changing cast and daily plot twists (such as looking for a fight with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you're left behind.
When I reached out to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't tear himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to the Senate bench and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back then and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Extra cash flow to most exciting midterm House races
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district is seeing an influx of money, thanks to a congressional district shift that has now put two incumbents in a race for the same seat.
The recently renamed Pittsburgh suburban district is testing the strength of Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is up against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were retracted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally delineated in favor of the Republicans.
The race into the new 17th kicked off with a campaign finance competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Campaign's Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a widely-watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador rather than supporting China, but then backed down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the US heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted Congress to move forward to effectively end any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now set to address Congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the gathering for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new angry messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Studying the History of the World
The next thing that could happen is the special hearing on Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also likely to focus his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in the country's attack on our election.
Should Congress fall into other hands, Mr. Trump will face accountability in that body just as he prepares to go before voters again, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peers.
That's a lot of asses, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, or that of his European peers.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the battle can last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West would oppose him and support the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's relentless course is hastened or delayed.
Americans now face several such tipping points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he proposed to secretly interview the president last year and speculated about his fitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair  or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we follow those tests, there's a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table that bore the swastika.
With that as my background, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic before Rapid Vienna battle
Rangers play host to Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but a draw is probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, with all the things that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but there's a feeling factor about the place now.
The group is good and the men are really enjoying it; the coaching is good.
Hopefully we can push through now, put last season behind us and be successful".
Women lose sleep over this fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk about it with their relatives.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, since those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you to come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your financing decisions for long-term care may include  a traditional long-term insurance policy,  a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance on your own - as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut out legal disputes as you go.
Get a healthcare proxy in place so you can appoint a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals honor your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider also having a proxy for your finances.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are unfit.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Spell out those details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are at stake, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place".
Man shot multiple times in Ilfracombe with a windshield
A man was shot several times with a windshield as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have called witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications disabled, emergency officials could not get any information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The county, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times during the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently struck by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake along the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 that led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A massive earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and led to destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 quake and tsunami.
It didn't lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings,
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on domestic violence charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took away a female acquaintance's phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su Pre-Trial Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "not guilty, definitely" when asked what he pleaded, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in jail and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal complaint has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before Alaska's Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the reporting of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's behavior to PTSD as a result of his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been knocked out of action with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathering for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentences for suspects in NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side freeway in Lower Manhattan to mow down pedestrians and a cyclist in his path in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges carry the possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, which included eight counts of murder for racketeering purposes, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "proper planning and foresight", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's manner of carrying it out as "abominable, cruel and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement of intent said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were executed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilise "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians needed to feel the "heat" of Eurosceptics  as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would be "out" by the time Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Ms May faces in uniting her deeply divided officers has been met by pro-Roman Tories joining a separate Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted that she would push through in her attempt to strike a deal with Brussels despite the deadlock and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told the Loop Means Loop meeting in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a nobleman and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we would have been out by now,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand for Brexit, but we must ban Chequers.'
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: "We did not fight world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is completely untrue.
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins was also at the march and told reporters: "I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for them, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bomb the streets and make sure we get elected in the first place.
Let Chequers go and start listening.
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr. Farge said that rally politicians had to feel the "heat" if they were on the verge of violating the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them we will not let you get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, who are about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us our victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
Some activists have been waving Tory anti-Brexit banners after the group launched this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application as the conference opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
This is a total scam.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to "look hard" to run for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "look hard to run for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is up for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's already in the middle of speculation that she might challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump took office.
An audience member asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the very top".
Arrest made in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims on Friday has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University's campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and was finally killed as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, possessing a weapon, and admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton clinches world title after team officials give him his win over Sebastian Vettel
This became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes' team commands would play a big part in the races.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and nearly won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two corners and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first, leaving Hamilton to drive far back into the traffic jam, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes drilled a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward to wheel-to-wheel action which left the Ferrari driver reluctantly risk-free to leave the interior in danger of holding out after a double-step move to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the starting grid and finished seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race as he held on to his tyres to finish fast and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually got into the pits on the 44th lap, but could not speed up his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day because Valtteri did fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an exceptional job to get a one-two", said Hamilton.
That was some bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "mean and rude and liars".
"The one thing that can happen and the sweet thing that has happened over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars", he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I did not".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I did not leak it".
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak it...No, we didn't leak it", he added, in a speech to the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter outlining the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked".
But the president did not approve of her denial, and during the Saturday evening rally he commented: "I tell you what.
Maybe not, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen".
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women and suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the rudeness, the rudeness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to outwit to gain power and control", Mediaite reported the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants won by a score of 3-1.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday's Elite League loss to Belfast Giants by winning the opponent's game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early two-goal lead on pitches from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the home team before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals sealed their victory.
This was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's men who first lost games and then won 2-1 at Dundee on Friday night in Belfast.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the catcher for Cownie's tie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead into the first half when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again tied them with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined together to help Nielsen take the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants, now down four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on plane can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and more are missing after a massive earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many are trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that was swaying badly at Palu's Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport.
He remained motionless to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he saw it collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait says the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We arranged for a helicopter to fly him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach the thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is believed to be still rising as many bodies are still under construction while many are still unavailable", agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves up to 20 feet [6 m] ripped through Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimum wage is being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is now missing after beach-side plane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia now says one man is missing after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane landed in the lake near the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane landed very low.
"This is a particularly good thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to walk through shallow water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said creatures working nearby to improve a pier also helped with an inflatable lifeboat to get people ashore before the plane sank in about 100 feet [30 m] of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have already died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini was involved in one.
Analysts break down the timeline of the night the woman was burned alive.
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cellphone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cellphones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed his cell phone was with Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was joking because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to basics and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY nanny sues couple for being fired for racist text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from the mother who complained that she was "not a black person anymore".
The couple deny being racist, calling the trial "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was shocked to learn that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After discovering her flaw, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that their outgoing African-American nanny was doing a bad job and that she expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for damages over the dismissal and is seeking his compensation in the amount of $350 a day for the six months, permanent work for which she was initially hired, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not doing so well", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple countered the accusations of racism by saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do and that they feared that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people", husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone to whom you were rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Go on now".
Plasco likened the case to "extortion" and said that his wife was going to have a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going after someone like that?
It's not a very nice thing to do", the investment banker added.
While the trial was still ongoing, the court of public opinion was quick to take the couple to social media and hack them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared a talking bear would not connect readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It is very entertaining that we know of Paddington's great success".
She said her father would have been furious if his job was rejected. He had been a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death last year was "bitter sweet".
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was a rather quiet man and he was not a man who was fond of apples", she said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplished something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he saw Paddington's success kind of that way.
Even if it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called often to say that it was terrible, that they didn't expect her to make it", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she would die in the next two minutes and that I should say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, lamb.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly running out and leaving her system.
She died a while before it and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was going to unfold.
I could not whine or scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold it together".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who by then was grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers on board - unaware of the ordeal she had gone through.
"No one knew", she said.
"I was shaking my head and crying constantly.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Mourning women post cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting postcards on a Welsh bridge for a while with inspiring messages and phone numbers for people to call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile brightened any room".
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that there will be a domino effect".
Mrs. Davis designed the maps, "to let people know that there are people out there you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you must speak.
Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he was feeling sick or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached a low point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he did not make eye contact or do anything with them".
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It's a big hole in the family.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still uncertain as the FBI investigates.
"I thought if we could actually get something like he asked for - a timeless investigation that had no scope - we might be able to bring some unity", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid entrenched partisan rallying.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters have the FBI investigate?
Their disagreement is all about timing.
The midterm elections are just weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's outnumber of overwhelmingly
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the South's unification cabinet and said there were 1,127 overflights last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by human traffickers were key factors, Mr. Park said.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights pass through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
China considers the defectors illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - still technically at war with each other - have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered around the ongoing negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons.
This came after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they broadly agreed to work together for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acted like this, they would say 'hysterics,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and choking as he discussed his family and high school years.
He also explicitly denounced Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "ridiculous and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's making himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade as he is considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't this great?'"
And women have to deal with it.
It's a righteous diatribe, months and years of rage boiling over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, is it?
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a CEO somewhere, who also said that she cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to,
I am angry".
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant".
Tears are permissible as a partial way out of grief because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of my early work in a male-dominated office is when I once found myself crying with nameless rage and being grabbed by the skin of my neck by an older woman - a cold-hearted manager I was a little afraid of - who dragged me down a stairway.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they affected you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and had to leave the races, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of running for president.
"I didn't think this decision through", she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Late in the campaign, she was behind with the find collections, so she vowed not to enter the races unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that of her supporters who gave men $1,000, only $250 would be given to her.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed with emotions - grateful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and angry at the sexism - that she choked.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown", recalls Mrs. Schroeder of the press' reaction to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She was crying"?""
How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the US-China trade war had been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 trillion (£150 trillion) of items, effectively taxing half of the goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in goods each time, recently slapping tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has vowed to match the US shot-for-shot and the world's largest economy is not going anywhere anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down means giving in to demands, but publicly complying with US demands would be too much of an embarrassment for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure over the US trade war over the long term could positively support China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a hasty political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could trigger an economic toll in either country is actually far more dangerous than viewers have previously acknowledged, said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia at the center of New American Security, a think tank.
Syria ready for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in an address to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure due to progress in countering terrorism, he said.
The government continues to restore normalcy to areas devastated by terrorists.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that sponsored the invasion.
Europe seals Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, blew his T-shirt in the water at the par-3 16th hole and conceded his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of the first 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land England's Poulter who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the tournament's all-time European winner with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It had been a rough year.
So grateful for Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory
He hands the torch to compatriot John Ram who on Sunday defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game.
The incredible pride I feel, to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that guy", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
An odd statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled to find the clean sheet all weekend with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke on behalf of his team after a disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys.
It had been this morning when we put some heat on Europe.
We have scrapped.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as their captain.
You should keep your hat on the side.
We were outdone.

The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in Red-eared sliders for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, spotted bloom conditions are being reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier cities - suggesting reduced concentrations.
In full bloom, the Rooigety stretches about 130 miles along the coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee towns.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough town, but at fewer locations than last week.
Redness has also been observed in Pasco City.
Medium concentrations in or near the coast of Pinellas City have been reported in the past week, low to high concentrations near the coast of Hillsborough City, background to high concentrations in Manatee City, background to high concentrations in or near the coast of Sarasota City, background to medium concentrations in Charlotte City, background to high concentrations in or near the coast of Lee City, and low concentrations in Collier City.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in the cities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
