Right-wing populists win in Austria, 29 percent overall
The first preliminary results show a marked weakening of the two parties in the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties in the Austrian parliamentary elections scheduled for Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, has been seriously shaken, suffered particularly heavy losses.
In contrast, the president of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the regional governor of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing to return to national politics with a victory.
According to preliminary results, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the country's strongest party with 29.8% of the vote, but has lost 5.5% of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
The situation is even worse for the ÖVP, which loses nearly nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
Both of these major parties have achieved the worst results in Austria's post-war history, and the result is literally catastrophic for the People's Party, which has led to early elections.
In early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a significant advantage over the SPÖ according to opinion polls.
But the voters were visibly punished for letting the government fail.
The first reactions to the results have already led to speculation about the possible resignation of party chairman Wilhelm Molterer, the current vice-chancellor.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the party leadership.
This development is likely to facilitate the increasingly likely exit from the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖ-ÖVP grand coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) had previously won 18% of the vote and the BZÖ 11% - the Social Democrats expressed their fears that the same situation as in 1999 would not be repeated when the People's Party agreed to a joint government with the populists (the FPÖ was still united at the time, having split from the BZÖ in 2005), which even led to sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already declared his willingness to cooperate with any party, and I assume he can return to Vienna in national politics, is obviously looking for this solution.
The Greens also entered parliament, but they lost some of their popularity and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties crossed the four percent threshold and did not get into parliament.
India may be cold
If the problem of Czech scientists being sued for illegal insect collection is not solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that relations between the Czech Republic and India could be frozen.
The minister made this announcement in New York after meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee, today.
"If this is not resolved, then yes, there will be a certain cooling off", he said after the meeting, which was held at the Czech initiative.
Mukherji said after the trial that the executive branch would have difficulty in intervening in court cases.
However, it pointed out that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local authorities in Darjeeling, which is the legal authority in the case.
"His problem could be solved", said the minister.
However, for Emil Kucera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji said that the best course of action would be to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Then he could apply for bail and be free to await sentencing, he explained.
Schwarzenberg testified that his partner expressed himself in a similar way during the trial.
"He has offered to appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to acquit him", said the head of the Czech diplomatic service.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole case is to provide the convict with "competent legal support", the Indian minister mentioned.
However, he said that the Indian side was already providing such assistance.
"Our primary interest is to maintain the best possible relationship with India, which has a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, his partner stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a grave mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists", he declared.
On the question of whether the Indian side had promised to deal with the case, the minister avoided answering.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises", he noted.
Czech judges in the battle for the seabed
Go to the electronic wall map showing Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
But he doesn't care about the continent. He cares about a little spot in the blue of the ocean.
"The island is part of Australia, along with the adjacent seabed.
The area is the size of the continent itself", says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the 30-member task force of the UN Division for Oceans and the Law of the Sea.
The head of the division, Václav Mikulka, a Czech lawyer, will follow up the explanation, which he sometimes adds.
There's a lot of work and enthusiasm here.
The seabed is rich in natural resources, and it hides a world that was previously little known.
It may include petroleum, minerals, and other minerals, but it may also include previously unknown living organisms that may be key to developing, for example, cancer drugs.
Sea-bed above land
Coastal states are now competing intensively for new undersea areas.
They are granted their rights under the UN Convention, which was agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is especially true of the area known as the continental shelf, which often extends as far as a few hundred kilometers from the coast of a given country.
Such a country has exclusive rights under the Convention to all sources of continental shelf.
"In simpler terms, continental slope is the part of the seafloor and the layer below that is the natural continuation of the continental shelf.
They extend beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often 200 nautical miles, the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the Delimitation of the Outer Limits of the Continental Shelf shall be accompanied by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly surveys and measurements.
It's the result of years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the committee.
The Committee has so far examined five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have been successful so far,' adds Mikulka.
The world has recently been struck by Australia's success in being the first to significantly expand its undersea country.
But New Zealand also won, with the seabed area allocated to it by the committee being about 1.6 million square kilometers, or six times the size of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the research.
The future profits from the use of the seabed are, they hope, priceless.
Other countries are continuing to submit their requests.
They may do so within 10 years of the date of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor begins, which the convention declares to be the "common heritage of mankind".
No country is exclusive here anymore.
The right to extract in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed is not Klondike", says director Mikulka, exaggerating by saying that "some of its areas are clearly delineated by law and their regime is fixed in a treaty".
Chechens in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the former Eastern Bloc under the joint 'Interoceanmetal' organisation.
In 1991, this organisation, like investors from some other countries, was granted the status of 'pioneering investor' under the Convention.
It is authorised to be produced in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area surveyed by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is there, a kind of undersea replica of the Tatra.
"This is a total of 75,000 square kilometres of land to be mined.
The area is rich in polymetallic minerals containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", says another Hindu lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a fellow employee of the division in Macedonia, gives another concrete example.
It's like a potato, or with a little imagination, like a scroll with the magic words that bring Gollum to life.
German special forces were present at the hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - and the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces were ready, but they were not deployed.
Details of the rescue of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are coming to light.
According to the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to the German Federal Army, in addition to the German Federal Army, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, and the FSB, and the FSB.
According to the Ministry's spokesman, on Monday evening, German forces were not needed, as the hostages were allowed to run and fled when they recognized signs of violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian Government accepted the assistance offered by Germany to engage it as an on-the-spot support force.
"Fortunately, this did not happen", a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers kidnapped a group of tourists, consisting of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts, on September 19 in southern Egypt.
Following a kidnapping in the desert area of southern Egypt, hostages were being routed across the borders of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has remained unclear, as have details of the hostage rescue or possible ransom payments.
The survivors, meanwhile, arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages are under the protection of the German Embassy.
He didn't give details of his release.
Berlin has not given any information as to when they will return to Germany.
According to the daily Bild, the five tourists and special forces will arrive in Germany on Tuesday in an Airbus of the German Air Force.
The U.S. House of Representatives is rejecting the bailout package.
The U.S. House of Representatives has narrowly rejected a proposed $700 billion bailout for financial markets.
The Dow Jones has plummeted.
The U.S. House of Representatives voted 227 to 206 to reject the government's bailout for financial markets.
Despite calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets failed to win a majority.
The sponsors were desperate to convince the critics of the need for a $700 billion package in a dramatic campaign.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic Party's negotiators, has called on the House to support the plan, even though it's still unpopular.
"It's hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn't happened yet", he admitted.
The Dow Jones dropped more than 6 percent, or 600 points, during the vote.
Investors were concerned that the state rescue package might fail.
The index rose shortly before the vote was over, only to fall again after the failure was made public.
Experts expect further severe turbulence in the international financial markets.
The program must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate before it can take effect.
The directors are registering more and more bookings.
A good winter is in store for German tour operators.
According to one study, the number of travel reservations for the following months increased significantly from the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the study found that German travel sentiment did not decline.
The German Travel Association (DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday that bookings for the winter season increased by 31% compared with the same period last year.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, the number of bookings in the autumn months is already higher.
The traffic of travel agencies in October exceeded the October 2007 figure by 11%, the DRV reported.
These results are based on data from GfK, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and extrapolates them to the overall market.
The Institute took into account the trips made up to the end of August 2008.
The weak dollar exchange rate led to a particularly high demand for travel to the United States, the DRV reported.
Here, the booking rate has increased by a third.
In addition, the most popular destinations for Germans are Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the German countryside.
The most sought after are the organized routes, said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the reasons for the non-compliance of the measure with the MEO test.
Passengers can save money by, among other things, booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple added.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so a further increase in traffic compared to the previous year could be expected - although another study shows that fewer German tourists took the trip compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Nonstop ballerina hits, beer cans and celebrities wearing designer dresses.
Debate at the Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's blonde, a TV host, and she wears a custom-made dress.
I'm a dark-haired schoolgirl, and I bought my dress at the mall.
But one thing connects us: We are in Wiesne for less than three minutes, and the photographers are already rushing in and filling their memory cards - very flattering, and all this on my first visit to Wiesne.
That's how we make friends.
Looks like the cheap dirndl is doing its job.
As a Wiesnese tourist north of the white sausage equator, my comfort is still limited by the folklore.
But when we get to Theresienwies, it's not so bad.
Almost everyone wears aprons or leather pants; no one looks grumpy or embarrassed - everything is perfectly fine.
The only weird looks at the chocolate banana stand are my dirndle coat.
A woman from Munich pointed out that I had tied the veil wrong: "You are bound on the left, you are free, you are a virgin in the middle, you are bound on the right, you are a widow in the back".
I've been secretly re-winding the machine.
"That's all right", he says, and laughs.
Others make less of a fuss about the subtle flirting techniques, wearing a simple "I'm too drunk to dress" film cap and showing off their naked buttocks without being asked.
The exhibitionist young man is called Bob, and he's also visiting Oktoberfest for the first time.
Which he finds very fantastic, with a long "aaaaa".
He tells me all this after he got rid of the contents of his previously drunken jug.
Right next to one of the fireplaces that everyone sees as a dump.
So Bob is one of the notorious "no peeing" people.
Others are not so fortunate to get rid of alcohol in this way.
By 8:00 p.m., paramedics are marching through the scene, taking care of the poor couple.
The nurses always show up in teams - four at a time, carrying a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
It works like most Wiesn visitors: arrival empty, departure clogged.
You can't tell who's in the liquor casket under the pony.
"These are the ones who are fully ready", one of the paramedics shouted at me at my question, then at the set.
Police have named the victim of the accident
Police have named a 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died at the hospital.
The Brentwood resident of Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
He was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving following the crash.
He's been released on bail since.
Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey was even considering joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps only 20 paces from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial quest.
Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in the neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the travel books say.
The building surrounds the end of the platforms, with a tower at each front corner, and looks like some German country townhouse.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's getting a little bit dizzy.
However, from the inside of the department store, it is clear that this was the westernmost gateway to a large enterprise.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, the "late future" of conquest, wanted to realize its ambitions to conquer the Middle East with this railway from Damascus through Baghdad to what is now Saudi Arabia.
German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
His railroad was attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army had withdrawn from Egypt and had driven the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
Hyderabad station was no better.
In 1917, a munitions train exploded, destroying the building's beautifully designed roof.
Turkish sources say there was sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly falling into disrepair and has largely outlived history.
At the same time, today, as a railway gateway to Anatolia and the entire Eastern region, Turkey serves as an expanding diplomatic horizon, at least in a symbolic sense.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq, Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded a night train to Ankara, the Turkish capital, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish parliamentarian, Suat Kiniklioglut.
The next morning, after about 10:30 hours of darkness, which at the time gave the beat to the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, the new city being a symbol of the new secular state that turns its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, which is known to have Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This has caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone-and-steel building, specifically designed for this purpose, in a developing suburban area, between half-finished shopping malls and coffee houses, where the middle-managers in suits, both men and women, meet to make deals in the early morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have been a right-of-center politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
"The party's foreign policy objective is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War upset the order", he said.
Turkey is isolated from the hinterland.
Today, he had to turn east and west at the same time.
He didn't have a choice.
It had to open in both directions.
"But is it possible that sooner or later he will be forced to choose?"
"Turkey never wanted to be left with a back door".
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here has almost mechanically repeated: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea surrounding countries are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey itself.
It's like they're trying to convey the message that, figuratively, with Turkey, all of Europe can get to Asia and the Middle East on those eastern railroads.
When I was back at Hydarpasha Station, after another mostly awake night, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conur, the two German gentlemen who had watched this magnificent structure being built 100 years ago.
How would they have been surprised to learn that Europe's Middle East ambitions are now largely in the hands of Turkey?
And as I waited at the port for the ferry to take me back across the Bosporus, I remembered that at the time Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
At least back then, there was no question as to which continent would claim this exciting country.
Memorable Lives of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: "Since 1962, as music director of Guildford, Vernon 'Tod' Handley has led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his musical plans for the district, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to be for under-21s, but when Proteus played its final in 1979 - many of us were in our late 20s - we simply refused to part ways with the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shape-shifter) was in keeping with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any score that was put before it - whether it was a madrigal or a Messiaen piece; unaccompanied or with orchestral accompaniment.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing and always exciting, and we owe it to the man who inspired our enthusiasm for music to remain unchanged throughout the years.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He always said, "A composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the quote.
So sing it".
Karmeister's technique was always perfectly clear and precise, but never dictatorial or excessive.
No matter what the musical level, he always raised me.
John Frayn Turner wrote about it:
If ever there was a general who should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
I've written reviews of over 100 of his concerts in the last 40 years or so, but never, never disappointed, and often delighted.
Tod Handley had a combination of greatness and humility, which is very rare.
He hated those commanders who, in his words, simply "walked the world with one or two well-known battleships".
We'll miss him a lot.
The name of the company is:
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your obituary, William Woodruff (September 25th), "in 1946 he continued his studies in economic history at Oxford, and in 1950 he was awarded a scholarship to the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while continuing to study for his undergraduate, master's and PhD degrees".
This is from Woodruff's author's notes on "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, whilst completing his PhD thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J. D. Chambers, which was published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
In 1950-51 he did indeed stay in the USA on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and moved to Illinois.
There's no telling why Woodruff would beautify this period of his career.
J. Vicente Resino in the Wise Man
"I recommend the exhibition "Flamenco and Life" by J. Vicente Resino because his black-and-white documentary style photographs are impressive.
Their simplicity and power, as well as their respect for the people in the photographs, caught my attention.
This exhibition is filled with emotion.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments".
Second time sales record at Honda
In November, Honda will begin to market the second generation Jazz.
It is true that the previous model had a large passenger capacity, but the interior design of the new model is even more spacious.
This is coupled with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more comfortable and increase fuel economy.
Evolution is against revolution.
This is what the second-generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the new Jazz looks very similar to its predecessor, it has undergone several internal changes.
These include, for example, innovative design, new bodywork, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we get into the details of the new model, we should tell you that the new Jazz was released six years after the first generation was launched.
So first of all, we can say that Honda has managed to refurbish this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
While less well-known in Europe, Jazz is selling records in other markets.
One such market is Japan, where in 2002 and again in 2008, Jazz was the most sought-after car brand.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million copies of Jazz have been sold since its release.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million copies sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda wants to continue to increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
In other words, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz, by 2009 it is estimated that it will sell 100,000 cars, which would result in a 17% increase in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the Spanish subsidiary's management estimates that 2000 units will be sold in a year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly alleviate the decline in Honda's sales in Spain.
The company's representatives predict 22,000 units sold by the end of this year, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain from 1,6% to 1,8% last year.
By 2010, I'd like to increase that to 2%.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be the Insight, a five-door compact hybrid, 4,370 mm long, of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 units worldwide annually.
According to the Japanese producer, 50% of the market share of Insight would be held by the USA, while the remaining share would be shared between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, following the official presentation in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in every way.
Its length is 3900 mm (five centimetres longer), its width is 1690 mm (two centimetres wider) and its wheelbase has been increased by five centimetres, i.e. 2500 mm.
However, its height remains unchanged at 1520 mm.
Besides the size, the passenger compartment has become more spacious.
The new bodywork and the central fuel tank guarantee greater interior space - a solution that can be traced back to the previous Jazz.
The total cargo capacity of the so-called double-decker trunk has also increased, to 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
It is also relevant that those dimensions refer to the type with a 1,4 engine, as the 1,2 Honda Jazz has a 379-litre boot.
Some exterior modifications can also be detected, such as rear-view lamps or optional panoramic glass roofs, and easier accessibility of the rear seats.
In addition, the rear-seat doors were raised to 80 degrees, compared with the original Jazz's 67 degrees.
The second-generation Jazz engines are new, too.
At the start of its operation, this small model is available with two, 1.2-litre and 1.4-litre engines.
The i-VTEC technology offers better fuel economy than the previous model, lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while the engine delivers outstanding performance in all respects.
The 1.2 litre power unit produces 90 hp at 6000 rpm and a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4900 rpm.
This engine - which in the previous Jazz was 78 horsepower - consumes 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, is now reaching 100 horsepower.
The 100-horsepower 1.4-liter Jazz uses an average of 5.4 liters and emits 128 grams of CO2.
The collision avoidance "honeymoon"
To develop accident-prevention technologies, Nissan has taken inspiration from nature, precisely from the world of bees, for its new invention.
A Japanese company has designed a robot that mimics the roar of bees to avoid accidents.
It may be that a device called Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C will be the first step in developing collision-prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technology Center in collaboration with the renowned Advanced Science and Technology Research Center at the University of Tokyo, Japan, built this little robot.
According to Kazuhhiro Doi, Brand Director of Technology PR and Research Development, the BR23C is a further extension of Nissan's four-level safety casing.
The robot is enhancing the collision avoidance capabilities of the company's products.
Each bee develops its own oval-shaped personal space in flight, which is very similar to the Nissan safety jacket.
But far more important is the complex eye of the bee, which allows it to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing it to fly freely in its own personal space.
To mimic the complex function of the eye, engineers designed a device called a laser range finder.
The instrument shall identify obstacles within a 180-degree field of view of up to 2 metres in front of the BR23C, calculate their distance and send a signal to the on-board microprocessor which is immediately converted into a collision avoidance operation.
"Once the obstacle is detected, the robot immediately changes direction by mimicking the bee's movements, moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid a collision.
The system is most distinguished from the instruments currently available in that the evasive manoeuvre is carried out completely automatically.
Without this, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the evasive maneuver cannot be upward or downward or transverse, but only in two dimensions and only in the direction of the invertibility of the wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and manner as in the case of bees.
That's why Nissan has added a rotation function to the robot, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, to avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process and respond to data every few seconds.
No need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it can operate without interruption with only a few dozen KB of memory.
Now, this may sound surprising, but it's not really gigabytes, but we're not even talking about megabyte-sized memory.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be available in series production cars within ten years.
The robot runs on lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, further applications may include the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to get the car to its final destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of the Mortgage
We have to admit that the US Treasury Department, besides having a lot of cash to invest, is not lacking in common sense.
In the wake of the crisis, and to keep Americans from falling into the trap of questionable mortgage banks, they created an entertaining and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
This is the Hotel of Bad Loans... which is the Watermelon.
The depiction of accommodation and especially the receptionist's sadness suggests that we should think again, twice, or even three times, whether it is really time to take out a loan.
And especially where to get credit, because that's probably the point of this.
The information on the website is indeed useful, but not very detailed.
It's more for teenagers than the general public.
But what if we supplemented the game?
For example, the hotel would have our dream room.
Actually, that's something, because we don't even dream about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens up its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that it will provide a stake in Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, for $9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after Morgan Stanley's stock price plunged sharply on the stock market.
One week after the preliminary agreement was announced, the two banks said that MUFG would acquire 9.9% of the shares in Morgan Stanley at a price of $25.25 per share, for a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price will be more than 19% below the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional USD 6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and an exchange rate of USD 31,25.
Morgan Stanley said that the global transaction is based on an average rate of $29, which is 28% higher than the current rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock price fell 6.79% at 5 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time, and closed at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to accelerate its transformation into a bank holding company", explains John Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley last week approved a new status that allows it to diversify its operations while remaining under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even greater caution from the giants of Wall Street.
The terms announced on Monday, however, show that the agreement has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought the stake would be entirely held in common stock", explained Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG in Tokyo.
'However, in view of the current market and economic situation, we would have liked to minimise and avoid any potential risks.'
In the light of the above, the Commission concludes that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
The transaction will result in a reduction of the return on equity of approximately 20%.
The agreement allows MUFG to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares after one year, provided that the trading price of the latter exceeds the conversion rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. rises to approximately USD 47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that the funds from MUFG will enable it to exploit its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquidity resources.
However, the spokesman of the group did not wish to give precise information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the merger of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency ratio by around 15%, making it one of the best in its sector.
Morgan stated that its balance sheet had "definitely" improved since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been a tough one for the group, with its share price plunging by half while the cost of its non-payment risk insurance has skyrocketed.
This cost decreased on Monday but remained high at around 12%.
The only other major investment bank that survived the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch is Goldman Sachs, which last week announced that it had reached $15 billion, part of which came from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group of companies.
The European Union is committed to the fight against terrorism.
The reconstruction of the republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
This is the joint plan of Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Corre of Ecuador.
Following the example of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa on Sunday outlined his vision for the new constitution.
It has successfully fulfilled its mandate, with 64% of voters voting in favour of the referendum, according to official results, which account for 80% of the votes cast.
According to the poll, 28% of the population voted by gender, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were cast by voters.
The draft constitution needed 50% + 1 vote to pass.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of the polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organization showed a huge overwhelming majority of the "yes" votes, 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa, by the way, spoke of his constitutional victory on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution has won a landslide victory", he declared, thanking the Ecuadorians at his governor's residence in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers (180 miles) southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
According to the report of the Organization of American States (OAS) observer mission, the vote was conducted in a calm atmosphere, with the main theme being a 444-point text that summarized the principles of "new socialism" defended by the president.
The proposed constitution puts state power at the service of the economy, while preserving the state's right to "development planning" for a country that essentially lives off oil production by foreign companies and foreign exchange sent by immigrants.
Correa's draft constitution, which was elected in 2006, also reinforces the power of the head of state, who can serve for up to two consecutive terms and has the right to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced his intention to take advantage of this opportunity and will run for president again in February 2009.
The Constitution also includes free health care and education, and the president has already begun to implement them in a country of 13.9 million people where half the population lives below the minimum.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could end the Quito agreement with Washington on the use of the Ecuadorian facility as a base for U.S. drug control measures.
19 hostages released in Chad
Egyptian commando attacked the kidnappers who had held hostage 11 tourists and their eight escorts for ten days.
The hostages are in Cairo now.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts were held captive in the desert for ten days before being safely transported to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released in Chad this morning by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good condition, they arrived by plane at around 4:30 p.m. at the al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were denied access to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Maadi, a residential area on the outskirts of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers "have not been paid a ransom", Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said at the airport.
The hostages were captured on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they were taking part in a field safari, and then the group was moved from one hideout to another by 35 unknown hostages.
The group included 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, which organised the safari.
A senior Egyptian security official said a 30-man special task force arrived by helicopter at the scene, where they raided the hostages just before dawn.
"The firing between the troops took place, half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled", said the leader, who asked not to be named.
He also said that a total of 150 special units from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade were sent to Sudan, where they were supplemented by German and Italian commandos.
The Italian diplomatic chief, Franco Frattini, who is in Belgrade, stressed the role of the Italian secret agents and special operations teams.
"We must acknowledge that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our intelligence people and task forces", he said, without providing further details.
He also denied that any ransom had been paid for the hostages.
The previous day, the Sudanese military announced that it had intercepted a field vehicle carrying the kidnappers during a patrol, killing six of them (including the Chadian driver) and arresting two others.
The army claimed that the hostages were linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately denied by the group.
Lettres - The "quiet majority" of culture
The debate on funding for culture is at the heart of the news and the ongoing election campaign.
We can only be happy about that.
But they continue to forget a part of our cultural life.
Who will raise their voice to shed light on the ridiculous amounts of money being spent on small museums, archives, archaeological digs and national historic sites on the brink of starvation?
What politician would dare remind the federal government that he doesn't care about its monuments and heritage buildings?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government has spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley alone?
And the Constitution of our American neighbors says that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that this heritage must be protected by every citizen, every elected representative, and every government agency in concert.
The Federation des sociétés d'histoire du Québec (FISQ) is a network of 211 historical, heritage, archival and genealogical societies, with more than 40 000 volunteers working on historical research and the preservation of a large number of private archives and archaeological finds on a minimal budget.
Often these organizations are protecting our heritage tooth and nail, and protesting with the last of their stranglehold as real estate developers and policymakers turn their bulldozers toward our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will anyone ever stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Part of Fortis Bank is nationalised by the Benelux governments
The Benelux countries are helping to partially nationalise Fortison, a Belgian-Dutch bank that has been in trouble - as the first European - due to the crippling effects of the US credit market crisis: the three countries are providing a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the financial and insurance institution with interests in Hungary.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments held a high-level consultation on the matter at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission's Competition Officer.
Fortis Bank is the first major crisis in the euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that has been raging for more than a year, and the decisions taken in the bank's case can therefore be considered in some respects as precedent-setting.
Under the decision made on Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49 percent) of the bank's existing assets.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including in particular the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired from Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Fortis' stock started to plummet last week, and the second half of the week was already marked by a major crisis.
But analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to allow itself to go bankrupt.
The company's stock fell by about 12 percent on Friday alone, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
At current share prices, the total market capitalisation of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company directors this is unrealistic.
The company's management blamed the uncertainties in the overseas market surrounding the adoption of the $700 billion U.S. package for the fall in Fortis stock.
The paper's been up a little bit on Monday.
On Friday, a new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to the bank.
The bank was looking for private buyers, but no one had come forward with a good offer.
The Belgian Government has already indicated that investors should not be alarmed, they should not lose their money.
The bank's customers have not panicked, the bank's accounts have not been raided.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches and has also acquired leasing companies.
Fox in the hen
Life and health insurers in America often refuse to make insurance contracts with applicants based on the information about people's drug purchases.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
'There is a data protection programme which requires the consent of the data subject to be used in all cases.
It must be in independent hands, or the fox will be left to run the henhouse", says Richard Dicke, a drug-tracking software developer for the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the amount of the accident insurance dependent on the health condition of the applicant and do not take out insurance if the risk is considered too high.
In the past, a person was sent for medical examination and the contract was only signed after the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: he could easily get a pharmacy customer ID number to tell him what medicines he had bought in the past year and a half, and from that the program could infer what disease he was suffering from and what his medical condition was.
For example, if you regularly take high doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it indicates that you have practically unmanageable high blood fat levels, which immediately puts you at higher risk.
Several versions of the scheme are in circulation, some of which also specify a risk factor, leaving the insurer with little to do but paperwork, although there are some minor difficulties.
Some medicines have a number of disadvantages, such as some compounds being used for migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-increasing factor for commercial insurers, the former is not.
Companies have been set up to collect and process the data, and they ask for the patient's consent before they get the information from the pharmacies.
Now they are being forced to do so by the authorities, although no penalty has been imposed for their failure to do so.
Some companies have recently started processing the results of laboratory tests and combining them with the data on drug use to provide an even more accurate picture of the health of patients.
More and more companies are accessing the data, and controlling their use is becoming more and more difficult.
There's a separate health data protection law, but it only applies to health care providers and insurance companies.
Congress is considering a bill that would give the government the power to control companies that specialize in reporting.
Dick Richard sees that this is not enough and has therefore developed a programme that would bind the transmission of data to the express consent of the data subject.
It is another matter that the person concerned cannot refuse consent, otherwise the insurers will not contract with him.
So the chickens are in some ways referring to the goodwill of the fox.
The global cuisine of Marseille
Doubling trade between the EU and India
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this topic dominated the agenda of the ninth summit, alongside other, largely global issues.
Today there will also be a French-Indian summit, which will focus on nuclear cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India is a rising democratic power which should be given a greater say in international affairs, but member states have not yet been able to agree on whether to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This is not the question that was raised at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, President-in-Office of the European Union, President José Manuel Barroso of the Commission and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Szingh, with whom they agreed to double trade to more than 100 billion euros over five years.
Given that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
In this respect, the 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been consolidated in a legal sense, meaning that air traffic can also be operated in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth largest among the EU's partners.
The summit focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism, were condemned in all its forms by both sides and urged the convening of a UN conference.
They also pushed for the end of the Doha trade round, although both have a large share in the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate agenda, which is to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed, as did the global agreement at the next climate conference to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
They also want to prevent food prices from rising and have supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is on his way to the French capital today to hold a bilateral meeting to negotiate the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they are hoping to get French companies contracts worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors in India.
News reports say the deal is for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian book publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers are strongly represented at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting, the 60th Buchmesse.
This year's Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to attract 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, with more than 403,000 books on display in a 171,790-square-foot exhibition area.
The Italian Government will be represented at the opening of the Italian Pavilion by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary of State at the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, who will be presenting 264 square metres of exhibition space through the creation of a single Italia Pont.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Struktur" room of Buchmesse 5.0, which will also provide an opportunity to present data, trends and prospects on the state of Italian book publishing.
The data show that the proportion of foreign authors on the Italian publishing market is continuing to decline, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
They found the plane of billionaire Steve Fossett, who disappeared a year ago.
They found the remains of billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, which disappeared over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007.
The wreckage was found at an elevation of 3,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada mountains near Mammoth Lakes, on the border of California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, Sheriff of Madera County, said at a news conference that "we have sent a team to determine the location of the plane and we can now be certain that it is the same plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance".
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said that a few hours after the wreckage was discovered, an investigative committee was called in to identify the plane and determine that it was indeed the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett left for a three-hour flight from Yerington, Nevada.
Also yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal effects near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two Fosset IDs issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was abandoned a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has set several records that have made him a legend.
In 2002, on her sixth attempt, she made the first balloon flight around the earth: a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world without landing.
Among his many records is the flight over the Andes at an altitude of 15,445 meters, which he accomplished as a co-pilot.
GLK, shocking commercial
An unusual, yet original and distinctly shaped, Hobbits' vehicle with large surfaces and cleaned corners.
In a nutshell, this is the latest "compact off-road vehicle" from Mercedes-Benz, with which the German carmaker has tried to give fresh impetus to the market.
It is precisely because of this unconventional content that the launch campaign for the SUV GLK, which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October, will be surprising and unusual.
The advertising campaign for the new vehicle is based on a previously unknown media communication tool, including utopian 3D posters, which have never been used by a car brand in Italy.
The giant poster campaign, which consists of three stages, will dominate Milan's central shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first stage of this new type of media communication starts with a spatial presentation of the car, which will show the new SUV in near-real-life, three-dimensional form, with the help of special glasses distributed around Corso Como.
The viewer will feel as if the car is standing out from the poster.
Then, with the innovative technology of Elumina8, every detail of the new GLK is displayed one by one, and then assembled into a single image.
There's no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the stereotypical advertising world of the automotive industry with this promotion.
Will this be successful in attracting potential buyers?
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
They're probably being banned from the track.
But who are the 150-200 boys and girls that are now the shame of all Italy? They are members of a group called "Ultras Italia", which has been following the national team for years and which, in truth, has not caused too much trouble.
They never fought with the opposing fans.
The group's core is on the right.
The chief organizers are from Triventos.
And also from Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
They were joined in Sofia by smaller, scattered groups (in fact only a few units) from Campania and Puglia.
Italian flags with the names of the fans' hometowns were waved, and on Saturday they were removed to avoid identification.
They're following the example of the English fans.
In Bulgaria, they were facing a real Nazi fan team, the Levski printers.
The Italian Football Association issued 144 tickets to Italian fans, which were name tickets to help check the supporters' team.
The Ministry of Interior checked everyone: there was no one on the road to Sofia who was being prosecuted, no one who was banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with football-related record were denied tickets and travel.
The Ministry of Interior is currently awaiting minutes from the Sofia police, and will then take the necessary measures: fans arrested or identified during the riots could face a five-year ban.
It is an international ban, which applies not only to Italian stadiums but to all European stadiums.
So our football hooligans can't set foot on any football field.
I'm glad you did.
But we also have to worry that the hooligans will find followers, which means that in addition to the 150 people, others will join them.
"This fire must be put out immediately, and no one should be excused for behaving in this way", the Interior Ministry said.
So we better keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday's national championship game is coming up in Lecce.
A small cell in Puglia supports the Italian ultrata.
Tomorrow is the Supervisory Board meeting, and Tuesday is the Sports Events Security Review Committee, which can count on one of the sections of the Homeland Security Service to investigate the secret services' handling of cheerleading.
"Duce-Duce scandals and waving arms during the Italian anthem?
This idea was expressed, rather unfortunately, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago to head the monitoring service of the Ministry of the Interior (the post was held by Francesco Tagliente and before that by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the police chief of Trieste, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italia group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true, it's not illegal in Bulgaria to keep the Duke alive, but that's what made the behavior of those 150-200 fans embarrassing.
I'm no sociologist, added the first man of the surveillance service, but crimes should be judged in the country where they were committed.
So far, this group has not caused any problems, so we need to investigate exactly what happened and consider what to do next.
But let's talk a little bit about the Italian anthem: it's not a crime, but, if I may say so, it's not polite...
