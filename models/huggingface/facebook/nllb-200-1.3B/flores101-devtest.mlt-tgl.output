Science journal published on Thursday a study providing a report on the creation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to have lasted much longer, due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin's sponson, Geospiza fortes, and the migrant cactus sponson, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into any kind of shape. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn on thin wire, which can then be polished and filled. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.

When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
Satellite in space receives the call and subsequently reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched by rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet long to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The bike has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the bike has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
He brought with him the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.

Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, termites and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special task that each cat has and that prevents it from competing with others.
Prides: The lion is the most social of cats, and lives in large groups.
prides are made up of one to three related adult males, plus a maximum of thirty females and cubs.
women are generally closely related to each other, since they are a large family of brothers and sisters.
The lion groups act like groups of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behaviour, and are also very fatal to their prey.
A good athlete in all, the tiger can kick (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The tiger's call is not like the lion's loud call, but more like a sentence of bluntly spoken words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch snails, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find prey by scent, by holding the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move in hiding, too. Oselots chase their prey by blending with their surroundings then jumping over their prey.
When a small group of organisms (small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (such as moving over a mountain range or a river, or moving to a new island so that they cannot easily move back) they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations as before.
over time, as the new population starts to adapt to its new environment, it starts to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands of years or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they won't even be able to call themselves the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Specialization is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals can't survive.
The mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing, except other mosasaurus.

While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans actually had a number of festive items that were strange or unusual, including wild boar, he-goat, baby-bear, and a type of very sleepy, egg-like rodent.
Another difference was that whereas poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, rich men liked to have a meal together where they would squat on their sides while eating their food.
The cuisines of Ancient Rome could not include the food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no wheat, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cacao, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods that was considered the house of the god.
The people made sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard inside the temple and, behind it, an inner sanctuary that was only open to priests.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.

Civilization is a singular culture shared by a large and significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, society.

cities are the precursors of nations. Civilizing culture involves the transfer of knowledge from several generations, a persistent cultural footprint and fair dissemination.

n the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government where Congress was its only component under the Articles of Confederation.

Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) and, therefore, makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
island group in Japan, Japan is often called, on a geographical position, an "archipel".
Taiwan dates back to the early 15th century when European sailors passing by registered the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the Taiwan Strait, and began a transformation in the practices of native grain production and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.

For example, the most common format of still image photography in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analogue film era.
still produced today but, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
35mm format is currently, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide with a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the highest ratio of a prime integer) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Family of APS formats) are equal to, or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The widely abused and often re-recorded rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
Throughout this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.


One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church has been Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to question whether this principle is being met.

The strategy was effective, stopping vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
UK mined international waters to prevent ships from entering whole sections of the ocean, thus causing danger to even neutral ships.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.

Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave that became known as Hira on the Mount of Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived throughout time, clearly shows the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
On top of one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.

Nothing can be seen but the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.

new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged car bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.


Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.

Subsistence farming is farming carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses raised seeds that are native to the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other techniques that are relatively simple in order to maximize yield.
n the past, many farmers have been involved in subsistence farming and this is still applicable in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel forgotten by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership using a different and symbolic style, including modes, manners, and language.
one of the most commonly used methods to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to use the unfortunate few cases of children who, due to neglect, misconduct or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
The children are called "wild" or "savages". Some wild children have been abducted by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of the children was due to the parents' refusal of serious intellectual or physical impairment of the children.
The child may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, wild boars show behaviour (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of particular animals that have taken care of them, such as their fear of or indifference to humans.

Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster care should provide all the needs that were missing in the home you took from it before.
Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and satisfactions.
Learning and socialization are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement andcontinuous relationships were also identified asnew aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, the facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his document The Presidents Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are, however, able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior also exist in animals such as domestic dogs.
20th century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
segregation and recombination mix the back and forth between the two groups per generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.

The most readily accessible plant resources would be the accessible proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food (meat, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but provides a high amount ofproteins containing all the essential amino acids.
On the whole, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as the savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep some time afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet trigger that will bring you to your senses without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your watch while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, and it will make you get out of bed to turn on.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking lots of fluids (particularly water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bedtime, thereby getting the person up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in the person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
Anyone can become enlightened. The only obstacle to this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were enriched by the path of Mahayana love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle.It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the idea that love accepts everything.Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle.Tibetan Buddhism consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the idea that love accepts everything.Tibetan Buddhism consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the idea that love accepts everything.Tibetan Buddhism consists of the practice of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the idea that love accepts everything.Tibetan Buddhism consists of the practice of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the practice of meditation.Tibetan Buddhism consists of meditation and meditation.Tibetan Buddhism consists of meditation and meditation.Tibetan Buddhism consists of meditation.Tibetan Buddhism is a form of meditation.Tibetan Buddhism is a form of meditation.

Through the visualization of various gods one clears the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates a consciousness of enlightenment.
The German Reich was still common in World War II, and led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war the disagreements in system, process and culture led to the countries fighting.

It was to last for the next 40 years and be fought in real terms, by alternative armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already divided, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize itself along the Rumen bridge.
However, these plans were almost overnight rendered obsolete, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the borders of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of freight ships is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
one of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
t the German fleet, which mainly uses U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to defeat Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It turns out that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes kept them in easy access to milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Goats were generally kept in hillside pastures or other grazing areas, and were often attended by goat herders who were often children or adolescents, similar to the better-known sheep herders. These methods of guarding the pastures are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and to pull larger loads than on the more gentle roads of the time.
crossties (crossed rails) were introduced rather early to hold the rails in place.However, gradually it became realised that rails would be more efficient if they had an iron stripe at the top.
This became common practice, but the iron made the wooden wheels of the cartons quieter.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron lines were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began to walk standing 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning standing man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright in their habits.
Bipedal specialisations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
can start living more environmentally, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. Yet, if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the source of the problems, and we need to disable it.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed a lot because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been made greater by mankind's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the handwritten bill and signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson were then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "the Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the lobby of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.

Most paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have fins and can fly.

They have shelled legs and pointed tails, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like T-Rex.
Pratically all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer language.
The symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient familiarity with fleas, which are insects well suited as parasites of humans.
both Killer-bugs and Bed-bugs are niches, adapted to live in the wild or in the place of their host.
Throughout the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to raise a child.
The adoption of a child is not a matter for the parents.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child/daughter.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides much of the scientific research.
experimental is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotles' views were accepted on all subjects of science, including psychology.
When the knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
The use of a single-phase flow is not recommended for the purpose of determining the time to release the gas.
biological clocks are self-supporting oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycling even without external indications.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used fungi, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by either marking the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are microbial line cells.
only mutations in the cells of the germ line can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
nature-based tourism attracts interested people who visit wetlands to enjoy the scenery, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks and the study of ecosystem information.


In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone, in some way, is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has moved the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. almost everyone speculates on transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two places and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
n the event of a collision, the driver must be able to identify the driver and the driver's driving position.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.

Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to flap their wings back over their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot flap their wings are the mazarel and the mayflies.

The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at some points being six miles wide.
Total, the Amazon is responsible for 20 percent of all the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.

The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors who, at the time, were well over a thousand years old.

The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by many of those working in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.

Aristóteles, the philosopher, came up with the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the four elements.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have an alloy that contains small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.

The atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them are in the dot at the end of this sentence.
The lapis lazuli was thus a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerged, lapis was relegated to a lower status and less use.
People now type messages on computer screens, and never have to go to a computer.
Who knows what the keyboard will become when something newer is invented.
The fission pump works on the principle that it takes energy to bind a nucleus to many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart on a climb. The splitting of the nucleus then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they tend to split with little effort.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km wide at its closest point and 100 km wide at its farthest point.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker below the highlands.

content theories are centered on finding what makes people happy or attractive.
Theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized when they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes certain people want the things they want and what factors in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
two types of attitudes can generally result when managers start managing their former colleagues. one end of the spectrum is trying to stay one.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to carry out disciplinary action, to carry out evaluations, to assign responsibilities, and to see that people are held accountable.
at the other end of the spectrum, you become a little unrecognizable individual who feels like he has to change everything the team has done and brand it as his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behaviour often creates divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The project will be implemented in the form of a pilot project, which will be carried out in the framework of the European Network of Various Networks (ENV).
Members of the virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams may meet across varying time zones and this may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
Invisible team is the management team to which each member reports.The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? One of the goals for the realisation in practice of the concepts of learning organisation is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuous Sequencing approach as a method being used to help organisations achieve a higher level of performance.
Theoretical approach to cognition research is physically demonstrated by neurobiological data, which makes the field of research less extensive and much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumour affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a strong connotation of fantasy, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, and deals with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation in a machine.
research on AI involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as built in various applications of computer software in homes and video games.

The technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol, every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.



Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by responding actively to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other people's writings and explain their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).

The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of East Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and the continent for which we speak in terms of wildlife.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel in the north, and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling states that she is married, what is her current status regarding marriage.
It's useful to wear a bracelet too (just not one that looks like it's worth a lot of money).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may consider to be harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, snatched from the arm, etc.

The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan king rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.

Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which covered most of the city streets, particularly the city center.

The town is also the base for the Nyiragongo volcano as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use the bodaboda (motor taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short turn.
Timbuktu has been used as a metaphor for exotic and remote lands.
Timbuktu
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
She was one of the main hosts during the PBS special series Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts strongly with other cities in the country, because it has more Arab than African elements.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the Horn of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Kukkukdrilli River (Crocodile River).
The park is spread over 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each containing different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered to be the model of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in the case of all South African National Parks, daily fees are applied for conservation and park entrance.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entrance to either selections of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island) lends its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place many tourists consider as the main focus.
The building layout that forms the Hong Kong skyline has been painted with a brightly lit bar as seen by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.

Hong Kong Island's urban development is mostly packed on advertised land with the North Shore.
This is the place where the British colonists took over so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
they include some of the last remaining positions of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/ wetlands.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer in the area.



shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers are 83 metres (2,073 ft) tall, 378 metres (1,370 ft) long and have two 3.50 metres (13.5 ft) wide spans.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points are expected to be ready.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, harvesting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquistadors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Desde la fundacion de Asunción en 1537, Paraguay ha logrado mantener mucho de su carácter e identidad indígena.

The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands lira (FKP) whose value is equivalent to that of the British pound sterling (GBP).
The only bank on the islands is Stanley next to the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley  credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
credit cards will probably not be accepted on the outer islands, although it is possible that the UK and US currency will be accepted; talk to the owners in advance to see what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to change the Falkland currency outside the islands, so change the currency before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is south of the Equator, so it is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures seldom drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.

According to the park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/m away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/m away from all other wildlife!

The animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
You should know, however, that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food with a strong odor and keep the field clean.

Travel agents often make arrangements with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages including breakfast, airport transport arrangements and even packages combining flight and hotel.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendments or requests should be forwarded to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
music festival goers decide to camp on-site, and many consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close you have to get there early to get a camping site close to the music.
remember that although the music on the main stages may be over, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic in winter, look closely at the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice makes a horrible sound for those most affected.
