The social card of the resident of the Ivanovsk region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The amendments provide for the preservation of the benefits for passengers in public transport.
From September 24 the order of organizing the favourite travel of citizens with the use of the social map of the resident of the Ivanovsk region is changed.
According to the press service of the Russian government on the Ivanovsk region, the changes provide for the preservation of the benefits for passing in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual calculations on the social map in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No. 161 FZ "On the national payment system".
The social card of the resident of the Ivanovsk region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Consequently, the conditions of its use are changing.
So, the limit of supplementation is now established not in trips, as before, but in the amount of cash, with preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter not more than 400 rubles, in summer period - not more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now the owners of the social card on the tickets issued in transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the remaining cash.
The cost of the preferred travel for citizens will be 1/2 of the tariff in force with the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of the trip is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule of filling the social card with cash remains the previous - in the period from 24 days of the previous month to 23 days of the current month.
The new order of the social map will have a number of advantages.
So, there is a possibility to carry out a detailed accounting of the spending of money on the social map with accuracy to copies.
In addition, there is the possibility of refunding the counted but unconsumed money.
We will also add that the scheme of intercalculations with the carriers becomes transparent, as now half of the cost of the trip is paid by the citizen, and exactly the same amount is reimbursed by the budget of the carriers.
No commission will be charged when placing money on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Chief of the Department of Road Economy and Transport of the Ivanov region, said that in 2014 more than 33 million trips were made in the region using the social map, in 2015 - 25 million trips.
In the regional budget for the provision of favourable travel of citizens using the social card is provided for more than 470 million rubles.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During the call at 911, a teacher acknowledges murder of a girlfriend
During the call at 911 with a voice almost rough, the teacher of the university Shannon Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that they need employees to come to them home.
Lamb emphasized that there was a "puppy" in the house who was alive but probably disappointed, and said that the contacts of the family members of the deceased could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentice and a handlessly written note on a white sheet of linear paper: "I'm very sorry, I'd like to get everything back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," the note says, according to the representatives of the body signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who conducted two online courses at the State University of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, managed to travel 300 miles to the university campus, where, according to the police, he shot all the respected historian teacher Ethan Schmidt at the edge of his office.
The head of the police at the State University of Delta, Lynn Baford, said the staff of the university learned about the shooting at 10:18 am.
He that Lamb made that true call in 911 shortly after that.
At the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The next day after the shooting in a school forced students and teachers to hide behind the closed doors, the staff still tried to put in one picture the motives that triggered Lamba.
The information shared by investigators on both sides of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped make a portrait of a talented but possibly worried teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Goethe, where Prentice was killed, said he was not charged with violence or criminal proceedings.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in his book, in which he expressed his gratitude to the “beautiful people” with whom he crossed in his teaching life.
Both of them taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for the occurrence of problems.
One student who had good feedback about Lamb, Brandon Beverce, said he also seemed anxious and nervous, “as if something was wrong with him.”
Another student, Michael Sax, that Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 school year about how he fought stress.
Earlier, Lamb asked the State University of Delta to give him a sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year he only taught on two online courses.
Recent changes in the university admission rules meant that the doctorate degree, which Lamb so hardly worked on, would not guarantee him the automatic admission of the teacher's position.
University President William Laforge said he didn’t know anything about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “obviously Mr. Lamb had something in mind.”
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
Police attacked Lamb's trace after he fled from the campus when he was returning to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was able to be arrested, Lamb was shot with a 38-caliber rifle on the back door of the house, one mile south of his parents' house in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington county corner Metel Johnson.
His car with a working engine still stood on the entrance road.
It was immediately unclear why Lamb came to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believes he knew the people living in it.
The lamp grows in those regions.
Lamb began to work at the university, where there are 3500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogics.
He received a doctorate in pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamba’s old friends described him as a smart, charismatic and fun man.
Carla Hayrston told me that she was 15, and Lambou was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends studied in senior classes, and he was a classy older guy who for several years tried to teach her to play guitar.
In those years, he was successful in women.
All the girls were stumbling when he was next,” says Harrston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, Brandon’s suburbs.
Lamb and Prentice at the moment of the events seemed to have met for some time.
During the call at 911 Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the record of their marriage is missing.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Goethe in a cylindrical house, the reverse side of which comes out on the channel.
According to the police, the dog is okay.
Prince's former husband, Sean O'Stein, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends, and they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
“She’s completely suppressed,” O’Stein told her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stein said he didn't meet Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentice when he and Abigail both performed at one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stein told me that his daughter is writing music and singing.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barman and co-ordinator of entertainment programmes in the tusklo illuminated bar The Julep Room in Goethe, said that the last time he saw Lamba and Prentice in the evening of September 5, when Lamba finished playing guitar and mouth harmony for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
“It’s just a happy couple,” he said.
We had fun and sparked each other.
They both were very intelligent.
Schmidt, the deceased teacher, conducted seminars for primary students and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, a teacher of English at the same school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at the Kansas State University in Empory and was the president of the Student Brotherhood and Student Self-Government.
At the campus of the State University of Delta in Cleveland on Tuesday evening about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and community members, participated in the memorial ceremony of burning candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university chore singed Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will be renewed on Wednesday.
“We are trying to get our students back,” Laforge said.
The crisis has passed.
Today is the day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was helped to prepare the Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Petus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police statement that the call of Lamba came to service 911 after the murder of Schmidt, as well as in connection with the fact that although Lamba talked about Prentius as about his wife when he called in 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us announces that it will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as last year, while the toy and children’s goods retailer assures that it will provide the state staff and temporary employees with the opportunity to work more hours.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and wholesale bases throughout the country, less than the 45,000 who were hired for the holiday season of 2014.
Most jobs will be part-employment.
The company said it will start interviews with candidates this month and will increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although there are still a few months before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer, and the companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to have enough state in the stores and for sale, shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox laughs about witnessing Princess Diana
The premiere of the film Back to the Future was a great event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the cinema and waited for the arrival of members of the royal family, I noticed that the place next to me was free, and here I was overwhelmed - next to me Princess Diana will sit," he said in a trailer to the soon coming on screen documentary "Return to Time".
The movie begins, and here it comes to my mind that I am literally a distance with the stretched hand and in one false snake from dating with the Princess of Wales.
Back in time - a documentary about the film Back in the future - includes interviews with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemekis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of the film "Return to the Future" took place 30 years ago.
“For me,” says Spielberg, “it is undoubtedly the greatest film about traveling in time that has ever been filmed.”
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and in some theaters in October.
UN head says there is no military solution in Syria
In response to Russia’s military support to Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that for almost five-year conflict “there is no military solution,” and arms growth will only aggravate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN head again urged all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said on a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning a meeting with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council – the United States, Russia, China, the UK and France – during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that disagreements in the Council, as well as between the Syrians and the local authorities, “made the situation unresolved.”
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in resolving the issue of Iran’s nuclear program and in considering the Syrian crisis.
8 Survey results that show that Donald Trump doesn’t joke
Some attempted to hang on him a provokator label.
Others turned away from him, perceiving it as a joke.
Some demand a scandal.
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to undermine Donald Trump’s high position in the results of the surveys, they have not succeeded (until now).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated Donald Trump’s advantage in two-significant figures, and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the real estate magnate in terms of the chances of getting a nomination.
This is only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
Nothing of this means that Trump has a chance to be nominated for the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at that time in 2011, Rika Perry was defeated to his pre-successive popularity German Kane, no one of whom won a single state in the process of nomination.
And there are many reasons why he would be fighting in general elections.
But external groups, such as the Supercommittee of Political Activity of Jeb Bush, and the Economic Conservative Group of the Growth Club, recognize Trump’s inadequate power and begin to supply their dollars to break it down.
Here are some numbers of surveys that say that the real estate magnet is not just a intermediate phase:
The rating of sympathy for Trump was 180 degrees.
Immediately before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans were positive to this real estate magnet.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52%.
Now six of the 10 Republicans are positive to Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators get the top in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of Republicans there are positive to Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would make Trump a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said they would either behave “with enthusiasm” or “with satisfaction” if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say that they would be "disrupted" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates approximately the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “with enthusiasm” against 40 percent of those who say the same about Trump).
The level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republicans say they will be "not satisfied" or "disrupted" if the establishment favourite Jeb Bush becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t consider Trump’s temperament a problem.
While Trump is massively criticized for his chastisement and insult, 52 percent of Republican voters across the country think that the magnate has the right temperament to be a president, as shown by an ABC News/Washington post survey held on Monday.
The same figure appears at the first closed assembly in the country in the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same person who could be the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he’s not the person who can be effective on the post, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
The Republicans are accustomed to this.
When they wear their chapes, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
Asked who was the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was the favourite, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week.
That’s not the case when four out of 10 put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the previous cycle, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported the possible candidate Mit Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign to be convincing.
Even if the Republicans united around another candidate, Trump would still be ahead of all the others.
Some scientists indicate that such a breakdown is likely to play Trump’s advantage, and at the same time those who do not support Trump are equally distributed among those who support more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in the hypothetical “one-on-one” competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorino, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeba Bush, and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Cassic, and Chris Christie.
He has nothing with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that surrounds him?
Ben Carson rushed the businessman to a whole 19 points in the hypothetical competition "one on one".
More than half of Donald Trump supporters say they have changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters who support Trump say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump’s most intense competition at the moment is with his co-outside neurochirurg Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve changed thought will most likely choose Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "violents" in his speech opening a campaign, the issue of immigration has become the most relevant in talks in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's landscape will deceive key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican Party and prevents rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post survey on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration attracts public attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
The government’s disappointment is gaining new turnover.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now expecting the support of approximately half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their outsiders status.
Six of the 10 Republicans on Monday said in a new ABC/Post survey that they would rather want a political outsider than a person with experience working in the government.
They are also harassed by Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, conducted two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed by the activities of the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent “unhappy” and 21 percent “in anger.”
The government will decide the fate of the pension indexations in October.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options for the implementation of the law on the indexation of pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation.
She noted that the decision should be found by October 8, at the time of the draft budget for the next year to the government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the possibility of prolonging the decision to freeze the accumulative pension of the Russians.
The amount of pensions is equal to 350 billion rubles.
Approximately the same amount is worth indexing the full pension for the next year.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is no final decision on the question who should pay the contributions for unemployed citizens.
The hunger believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong, at the same time, to socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not quite fair that society pays for him.
Earlier the media that the cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are the centuries often irritated and red?
The ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashova replies:
Our centuries are shells that protect the eye apple from a multitude of small particles that sit on them.
Forgetting of regular cleaning of the age, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The output is simple:
Don't throw your eyes with dirty hands, carry a special moist sack for the wheat;
At least 1-2 times a day, cleanse the ends of the century from the harmful substances accumulated in them during the day.
Cleaning procedures are no need to be supplemented with warm compresses with medicinal herbs (shalphia, rubber), feeding the thick secret of the salic glands, and then with a massage of the edges, which should be carried out by circular movements of the fingers;
When washing the makeup, do not use alcohol-containing drugs.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to even more slurrying the secret of the salivary glands.
Pyongyang says Korean nuclear weapons have created a nuclear head.
North Korean authorities said the country's main nuclear reactor - the nuclear complex in Yongbye - is working "on full power."
This was on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that the North is ready at any time to respond to the “aggression and nuclear threat of the United States,” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “both in quantity and quality.”
The last nuclear test was carried out by North Korean authorities in 2013.
The plans to restore the full operation of the reactor have not been since.
Pyongyang says he managed to build a nuclear head.
North Korea has also repeatedly tested medium and short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded to remove from the Russian gym the mention of the brother peoples.
The leader of the LDPR Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the union of brother peoples should be removed from the national gym.
This he said during the meeting of the State Duma, reports "Russian News Service".
Who are these peoples now?
fascists and murders.
“A very long hymn, the longest in the world, even athletes don’t endure,” Zhirinovsky said.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the fourth lines containing this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky stated that the current hymn should be changed to "God, the king keeps", and the Russian tricholor to be replaced by the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad urged all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has urged all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is convinced that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, they should stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether or not Europe accepts refugees, but whether it is necessary to eliminate the primary causes of this problem.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
“This is the issue of refugees,” he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue dialogue in order to reach consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible as long as people die, as long as the bloodshed continues and as long as people feel completely safe.
“Therefore, we can reach a consensus, but we can’t realize anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria,” Assad said.
About 500,000 migrants have arrived in the EU countries this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission said the current migration crisis in the world is the biggest since World War II.
There is no exception that among the migrants arriving in Europe may be thousands of terrorists of the Islamic State group.
Members of a terrorist organization prohibited in Russia may use the situation to create their cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
The residents of the German city organized a holiday for refugees.
In the last month, Germany has become the leader in the reception of refugees, although recently it has strengthened border controls to stop their flow.
The authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call significantly big numbers.
More than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country since the beginning of September.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose inhabitants offer migrants a very warm reception.
Jeremy Corbyn debuts Prime Minister's questions session
After the elections Mr. Corbin's debut at the question session of the Prime Minister is expected with great delight.
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon speak for the first time at the Prime Minister's questions session, for the first time measuring forces with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will speak with the first of the six questions answered in the afternoon; his speech is likely to be closely monitored by the press and Parliament members of the Labour Party.
He spoke with the call "Less theatre and more facts" at a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said he could miss some meetings by leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbin’s first parliamentary trial as a leader; it will take place after the appointment of the Shadow Cabinet and his speech at the annual Trade Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the leader of the Labour to remain silent during the performance of the national gym on service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain caused criticism by a number of conservative members of the Parliament and became the topic of several advanced articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the state hymn attracted attention
Mr. Corbyn’s spokesman said he “stained in a respectful silence” and recognized “the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle for Britain.”
However, Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight to BBC 2, that he would advise the leader of the Labour to sing the national hymn "independently" of his belief in the need for the abolition of the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbin's team, raising disagreements on economic, defence and international policy, while less than one-six members of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
The BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political disagreements are also "covered by a stop" in the Labour Party after Mr. Corbyn's appointment for a position in the European Union and the government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbyn said at the Trade Union Conference that the Labour Party has made amendments aimed at removing the idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow minister of labor and pension payments said that there is "full clarity" in the party because it was in opposition only to government plans to cut the upper bound from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labourist with whom David Cameron will meet at the “Curry Box” in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says that he has "attracted collective resources" to gather ideas to Mr. Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
A parliamentary member from the Illington North county said that the Prime Minister's questions are causing overconflict, and that he will also abstain from sharp answers and exchanges, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges facing the youth.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Igl, the Secretary of Economy in the Shadow Cabinet, will replace him on the Prime Minister's questions when he will be absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron is abroad.
He also expressed the idea of allowing other colleagues to speak when possible, saying he was addressing the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Berko, to discuss the issue.
Becoming a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to get away from the political style of the "barright ballague", often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure, but admitted several years later that he failed to do so.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister’s issues have become a key indicator of the leadership’s views, their ability to govern the House of Commons and the reputation of other Parliamentary members, although critics say it has become a caricature and requires large-scale reforms.
"Filmed in Yoburg" Homeless young people studying at photographers

Pounds grow as wages rise in the UK
The pound rose in the background of salary growth in the UK, while the FTSE 100 index rose thanks to the proposal for the purchase of SABMiller.
Between May and June, the earnings in the UK, with the exception of the bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the highest since 2009 and was seen as a transition to the earlier period of forecast on the possible growth rate.
The pound increased more than 1% compared to the dollar and amounted to $1,5505, and 0.84% compared to the euro, amounting to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
On the overall background, SABMiller shares were distinguished, which grew by 20% thanks to the purchase offer received from the competitor AB InBev.
The deal would unite two of the world’s largest beer companies by gathering such brands as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s shares rose by 0.9% on the background of the encouraging news from the competing group of luxury products Richemont.
The latest Richemont sales data have exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China – on the key market for Burberry – have started to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5% after the mining giant announced that it was able to earn $2.5 billion by placing shares, which was done as part of the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi’s stock of paper and packaging was the leader in the index fall – 4.3% – after Goldman Sachs lowered the group’s rating to “sell”.
The shares of JD Sports rose after the sports clothing supplier announced a 83% increase in income before taxation in six months to £46.6 million.
Head of JD Sports says higher wages can prevent expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means “more purchasing capacity in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will overweight an increase in the cost of labour costs, he says.
The costs could affect the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional jobs.
Metcash launches down initiative campaign to fight the pressure of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the pressure of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
The food wholesale provider on the initiative from the bottom launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and West Australia in the light of the upcoming $700 million infusion by Aldi.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and promote the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social networks and on events such as the Adelaide Show.
The campaign is joined by IGA retailers and suppliers, such as the Dunsborough ice cream manufacturer Simmo's, which offers taste in IGA stores, and stores owners selling with discount to permanent customers tickets for South Australia Football League matches.
It is expected that Metcash will reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29 – the day when this wholesale supplier of food, alcohol and commercial products will celebrate its annual Investor Strategy Day.
In South Australia and West Australia, IGA shops account for 30% of all Metcash shops and show higher profitability than Metcash IGA network in the east states.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known as traders of usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the South and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the east states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will recover 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months after opening their first stores, taking the volume of sales from all present players, but mostly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, Morgan Stanley analyst, believes that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales a year, and Metcash - $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, achieving sales of $500 million and $600 million on these markets respectively.
Loss of revenue and food sales at a high level of constant costs of Metcash could cost the company about 13 million revenue before the payment of interest and taxes, says Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash loses its market share in the east states, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, while a recent Morgan Survey study found that IGA has the most loyal customers.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s food sales will drop by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company’s market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading stock manager Hemsh Douglas, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, noticed to the attendants at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "may have a high probability of disappearing within a decade.
Metcash has refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas’s comments.
But it is supposed that a member of the Board of Directors of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The IGA market share has decreased from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash’s revenue from the food business, which it supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has decreased by 43% compared to 2012 due to operational devaluation and pressure on sales and profitability.
Nevertheless, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million a year to balance retail prices with prices in Coles and Woolworths by a thousand positions a week and helping IGA retailers reorganize the shopping sites, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider selection of corporate food products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says that the price equation and the re-equipment of the shops are gaining turnover, and hopes that the company will a net profit increase in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakisa supports Tennis Australia president Steve Hill
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Cockinakis has indirectly suffered in a recent scandal around his friend Nick Cyrus and for his behavior he deserves more honour than criticism, as Tennis Australia President Steve Hilly says.
Cockinax, the younger in the talented duet and often called "Special Ks", accidentally found himself at the center of attention due to Cyrus's scary match with Stan Wavrinko at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after that, during the hot qualification match in Cincinnati, the high court had to divide Cockinaxis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, while Harrison stated: "Wavrinka had to be put on Cyrus' balls, and I had to be put on this guy's balls."
Since Kokkinakis last saw a broken missile after a collapse in his leg saved Rishar Gask from a possible defeat at the US Open, Hilly is dedicated to protecting Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grot for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomic in a single break in the semi-finals of Davis Cup against Britain.
“I’m deeply concerned about one thing, that’s that Tanasi’s got into the conflict,” Hilly said.
He really broke the rocket when he had a leg to the US Open, but he’s not the first player to broke the rocket when hopes were broken, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he’t become proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good in quite provocative situations in the US, with Harrison, and so on, and I am sure he deserves trust.
He is surrounded by a great team, he has a great family, and I just think he was a bit unfair.
He’s a very mature 19-year-old man, he works a lot, he’s well in the team, he’s never had problems with other players, he’s respected outside the court, he’s intensely trained, he’s in excellent form, he’s a very ambitious and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated by dignity.
Hilly also supported the decision to forgive Cyrus for the important match that begins on Friday, believing the "threatening agreement" as the right outcome for all, but hoping that the guy from Canberra will return to the team as a long-term player.
“First of all, we want the team to be fully focused on the match, not on the disputes around [Kyros],” Hilly said.
And I think Nick has gained strength very quickly, that is proven by people like Federer and Marrey, he grows in the eyes of the public, he has made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all that criticism he gets, but we’re trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and it’s necessary, I think, to get him out of the center of attention for a while so that he can think about them, and that’s the best for the team and the best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares emergency, closes its borders, detains migrants
Having declared a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday crossed the border with Serbia on the southern border and holds those trying to penetrate the country illegally to stop the flow of migrants.
On the border there were disorders - hundreds of migrants gathered on the border territory, which Serbian authorities reacted sharply negatively.
After stopping for an uncertain time on the road between the control points of the two countries, people who fled from armed violence in their homeland broke the tents and found themselves in the area.
The dissatisfaction increased.
When a police helicopter crashed over them, the migrants cried “Open the border!” and screamed offensive to the Hungarian special police.
Some protesters refused food and water.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia has declared the "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, as more and more of them arrives from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution of the problem, not the accompanying damage.
It is necessary to negotiate with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The tensions on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the next day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to assume the total responsibility for 40,000 people seeking asylum in overwhelmed Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that in the future (the next month or by the end of the year) an agreement will be reached, according to which Member States will receive another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an emergency summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis that covers the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for urgent action from Brussels or its neighbors.
The state of emergency announced on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities more powers to act against the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and accelerate asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Seyardo, said that his country is also planning to raise a crossing from the crossing wire on the part of the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has completed the crossing on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagat that even the prisoners were connected to an urgent work on completing the crossing of the crossing trail between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary has become the main “high place” and the point of crossing the EU border for immigrants, many of whom are refugees – victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán insists that the majority of the people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a more prosperous life rather than refugees – victims of war acts that have the right to defence, and this point of view is sharply disagreed with the opinions of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, are now considered a crime of crossing or damaging a 4-meter (13-foot) crossing band built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer imprisonment periods for people accused of trafficking.
“Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government has declared a state of emergency,” government spokesman Zoltán Kovac told reporters in the southern city of Seged.
We make it clear: illegal crossing the border is a crime.
Formally, the parliament is still to sanction the placement of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters, who are on the border, have been observing there for a few days the presence of armed to the teeth soldiers with vehicles and dogs.
Orban’s national security adviser, Deerdi Bacondi, said the authorized authorities had arrested 45 people trying to cross the border at the same border, and another 15 people inside the country.
They crossed the border, broke the ceiling, are currently under police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are rapidly restoring the plot.
The Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of the seven passes on the border with Serbia, pushing for the blocking of one of the passes a railway wagon, covered with a curve wire.
Disorders exploded on the main passage across the border near the city of Rosk (Hungary), as the Hungarians placed an office room to pass people inside a metal container, and the crowd of people pressed each other to break into it.
About 20 people were able to penetrate inside, while thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced a refusal to food and water until they were missed to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders dropped twice in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to retain a two-significant advantage in the Democratic race for the nomination throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is pursuing it.
Clinton now has a 47 percent support among primary voters-democrats (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, receives the support of 15 percent of the primary Democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the competition in the primary elections, the majority of Democrats say it’s too early to say that they’ve decided with the candidate they’ll support.
Clinton’s supporters are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton holds a great advantage among women and moderate, but this advantage has decreased.
Her support among men has declined significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points away from her.
The preference Clinton was given by the Democrats under the age of 50 has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now equal.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among the elderly voters.
Last month Clinton ran Sanders to a two-point number among the liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Nearly half of primary Democratic voters throughout the country say they would with enthusiasm support Clinton if she became a candidate from the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her only because she is a candidate.
6 percent would not support it.
It may not be surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic at her expense.
Among those who don’t support Clinton at the moment, the views are more contradictory – only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support her.
While 48 percent of primary Democratic voters say they would be enthusiastically supporting Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked an open question why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 percent), then that now is the time of a woman-president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for that post (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also talk about the association that connects her with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also called agreement on issues and chances of election.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential participation in the elections, 57 percent of primary Democratic voters would like him to join the race – although a third believes he does not follow.
When asked who they would like to see in the second place among the party candidates, the primary voters-democrats in most cases call Biden.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say they would choose Biden to be the second, that’s more than Sanders’s.
If Biden decides not to submit his candidacy from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the competitors to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democrats see Clinton’s candidate with the best chances of winning the general election; however, this figure dropped from 78 percent last month.
According to this indicator, Biden with a great departure in the second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, answering the question that is most important in the candidate, Democrats choose other options besides the chances of being elected.
Similar to the situation last month, no candidate from Democrats or potential candidates is an inacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Candidates from Democrats, or potential candidates, showed a good result on some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, and Clinton's strong side in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of primary Democratic voters don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t have a certain opinion about him on this issue.
The primary voters-democrats also in general consider similar ideological views by Clinton, Sanders and Biden.
According to all these measures, about a quarter of Democrats have no opinion about Sanders.
Though questions about Hillary Clinton’s personal email box and server as her Secretary of State continue, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this has not affected their general opinion about it.
But this is a completely different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans today are not satisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The opinion of the public about this was divided in March, shortly after this story became known.
Most Americans say the controversy about e-mail has not affected their general opinion about Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion about it has deteriorated.
Mostly it is Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim that their opinion about Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considers her party’s voters to be honest and trustworthy, it remains a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent consider her to be honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
62 percent of registered voters don’t consider it a fair and deserving trust.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country don’t consider Trump an honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, get good scores in leadership qualities.
Of the six protested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush show the best outcome in honesty.
Most people see a more honest person in Sanders than not, but, like Carson, many do not have any opinion about him.
The error limit for a sample of 351 primary voters-democrats is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of the national survey, Ben Carson closely approached Donald Trump.
Ben Carson closely approached Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times survey
The two candidates gained half of the votes in the new poll, leaving all the others in search of support under their feet.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump, whose support ratio increased from 23% in the recent CBS survey, held on the eve of the Fox News debate last month, to 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson landed in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson is supported in all the demographic groups, throwing Trump into a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The remaining candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Casic, rejected with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Hackabi and Florida Senator Marco Rubio together rank third with 6%.
The error limit for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus-minus 6%, the survey was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC survey, published last week, showed Carson’s growth in polls – demonstrating 19% support among Republicans and 32% support for Trump.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In connection with the growth of Carson’s support last week, Trump made several critical attacks to the former neurochirurgist, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said on Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood are accused of the death of Baruch College primary student
Approximately two years after the death of a college student during a fraternity ritual in the Pokon Mountains in Pennsylvania, the murder accusation was raised against five people.
"The members of the Brotherhood of Pi Delta Psi from the Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chan Michael Deng during a dedication ceremony in September 2013 and did not deliver him in time to the hospital, which led to his death," the police said.
Officials say that the student with a blind eye and a 30-pound bag with a sand behind his back was twisted several times while he was trying to reach the goal, going on a sliding surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconsciously.
Members of the P. Delta Psi brotherhood didn’t call at 911, when Deng lost consciousness, and waited an hour before he was brought to the hospital, the police say.
However, they found time to change Deng’s clothes, find in Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national chairman of the Brotherhood, to ask the council, as police chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
“At this point, the members of the Brotherhood began to hide their personal property, in essence, putting the well-being of the Brotherhood above Michael Deng’s health,” said Chief Wagner.
He could not be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the revelation report, Deng received several stupid wounds in the head, thumbnail and bears.
“There’s too many families suffered as a result of the rituals of fraternity, as at least one student dies during them every year, starting from 1970,” said Douglas Feuerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The Brothers and their members must bear responsibility, and this step by the authorities is very important.
Monroe County prisoners tended to favor the accusation of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Manga, will be charged with violence against the newbie and criminal conspiracy.
“We want to bring to responsibility not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned all of this officially or informally, then it’s also,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned brotherhood, and national brotherhood excluded the local department from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
There will be a rise in rates, and the “bear market” will collapse, bond revenues will grow, and the economy will fall into a recession.
That we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will last before the attack, and how long it will last.
Especially for the economy, history explains little about time.
The recession occurred only 11 months after the first rise of rates and for a total of 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, although not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the U.S. Central Bank administration so strongly emphasizes that investors should not focus on when it will start raising interest rates, but on how much the adaptation will take.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the foolishness around the rise of rates is exaggerated.
“The first rise of the Federal Reserve’s interest rates with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the end of the era of cheap money,” said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in his commentary to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still lower levels to be a seismic impulse that many are afraid of.
This does not mean that there will be no consequences.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy could react depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the last month or about that, expecting a rise in rates can lead to instability for some time.
When the rate increases, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
“It seems that the earnings from shares have stopped for 12-24 months after the first jump, which again is likely to reflect a delay in the monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the Federal Reserve’s rate increase results.
If more specifically, the market has changed more dramatically over the past about 35 years - about 14 percent - in the direction of the rise of rates, remaining fair enough for 250 days after that (the average rise of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returns to normal with an average profit rate of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis conducted by Bob Doll, the main expert in stock trading strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities has a tendency not to become more prominent at the stage of the rise of interest rates, and the income from shares begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but increased interest rates are often contributed to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed under conditions that have not existed before and may accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point throughout the lifetime of an increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of increased rates since 1950 only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, few believe that it is long, while in the third quarter it remains at just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
The rise of interest rates on such an unstable economic background can be risky and puts the question "will this time be different," Deutsche said.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates by the Federal Reserve system throughout the year, with their views linked to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in rates at this meeting, future trade says that it is only 25 percent likely.
"In our study since 1950, all cycles of interest rates up to the present day were in the supercycle of increasing financial growth in GDP, which covers the peak ahead of a recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report says.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle is the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, it lasts 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market is expecting a rise in rates, and this scenario is somehow similar to the one that is implemented for shares.
The principle difference is that for bonds the effect occurs faster than for shares when the federal system changes the strategic rate.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the revenue changes the vector immediately after the first rise/reduction of the rates in the cycle.
At the end of the rate increase cycle, bond revenues are falling immediately,” Deutsche.
Strategy experts from Charles Schwab believe that the rise of interest rates will lead to the fact that long-term and short-term bond profitability levels are approaching, making the curve more flat.
High-income bonds often behave better in such a climate, although “we’re still afraid of profit fluctuations,” says study Katy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the federal system policy.
“In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations, there are signs that the market is up to the prospect of a harder monetary policy,” she wrote.
The interest rates on short-term loans rose, the curve of profit was more flat, the credit spreads expanded, volatility increased - all the characteristics of the market with the aggravation of the policy of the Federal system.
In general, companies leading their main business in the U.S. will benefit from increased interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be in a worse situation as the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive in financial.
“History shows that ‘quality’ shares are more efficient than the market within three months after the initial rise,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer report.
Companies with a stable financial status overcome companies with an unstable status by the results of each rate rise in 1994, 1999 and 2004 on an average of 5 percent points.
Companies with high capital revenues and low volatility shares also showed better efficiency than low-quality shares, on average by 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will be a big question.
Companies with high debt interest rates will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to pure exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Investors could see profits also through higher profitability, although experts differ in how quickly it will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - a copy of Classic FM," - says parliamentary member from conservatives Andrew Bingham
Parliamentary member from conservatives Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "lowering standards"
It demonstrates that it becomes less distinctive from the commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize was just matched with the Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damian Collins, who crashed on The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," the parliamentary leader said, encouraging the radio company to prove that it is doing something that commercial companies do not.
The conservative parliamentary member Andrew Bingham also told the BBC’s leadership that it seems that the public radio station is “blind” and becomes less distinctive from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'simplification' - but it seems that it turns into a Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, looks like The Brits under another name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here’s two examples that first came to my mind, in which you’re actually just copying what’s already on the market,” Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC’s chief executive rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn through Radio 3, I don’t learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and the creation of music will actually not be compared to anyone anymore.
“It’s also very important, I think, Radio 3’s interest in finding new music and promoting new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey claimed that the radio stations have to work much more to attract the audience than in the past because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child who was attacked for attacking commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Tory's parliamentary member Damian Collins attacked The Voice - a talent music show that the BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media for an indicative price of £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed in connection with the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Fate and Boy George participate as judges, was made in the "typical BBC style."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit in its own home cabin" the next time it will launch a entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of the new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
The growth of online sales slowed at the maximum in August, and the fault could be Black Friday.
Online sales increased by 7% in the first three months of 2015
Last month was the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that November Black Friday could contribute to reducing spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has experienced a boom, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that now there are signs of equalization of online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total online shopping costs in August showed a minimum growth since they started fixing in 2000, increasing only by five percent.
Experts say there are now signs of equalization of online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rates in the previous years and get back to 2000, they’ve always found a reasonable explanation,” said Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to use their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people got the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do it under any conditions, for example, sitting on the sofa.
But now it comes out on the plate, and you can see a decline (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for sales delay.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying the day before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers in a number of five times the average rushed to computers to be able to take advantage of profitable offers, thus breaking down a number of seller’s websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers go into a real struggle for profitable purchases, could make people refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a little more than 1 pound of each 5 is spent online.
As for products such as TVs and washing machines, more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more desirable than in fashion stores on the central streets.
Muslims buried the dead in the fall of the crane in Mecca, and the family of Ben Laden was sanctioned
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead on the streets as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia has partially blamed Saudi Binladin Group for the crash.
The Ministry of Health that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crunch.
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the world gathered on the streets to burial 29 of the victims of the crunch in the main mosque of Mecca.
Dressed mainly in white, the present at the funeral captured the passing part to give respect to the first of the dead who went on their last way to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
The sad procession passed across the holy place, where just a few days earlier the building crane broke the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the pastors.
The bodies were delivered for funeral, and at the same time the king of Saudi Arabia punished the construction company belonging to the family of Ben Laden for the accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 priests killed in the crunch in the main mosque were carried on the streets.
Among the dead was the father of four children, Kassim Akram, from Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman said that Binladin Group shouldn’t leave the crack shell lifted in the unworking crack.
The Arab version of the decree, published by the state agency Saudi Press, says that Binladin Group is partially guilty of the collapse.
The English edition of the news agency did not tell the details, but that the company's leaders were banned from traveling outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to figure out the cause of the crana falling in the main mosque hall, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered to go to Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the crash and its representatives were unavailable to comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inappropriate agreements with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the large-scale construction work carried out by Binladin Group.
Bin Laden’s family has been among Saudi ruling families for decades and has managed the largest construction projects.
The deceased al-Qaeda leader, Usama bin Laden, was a son of exchange, from whom the family rejected in the 1990s.
The accident occurred under strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in a pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in life for every working Muslim.
The officials that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials ordered to pay one million riyal (approximately £174,000) to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount to the irreversibly recovered.
The remaining victims will receive half of that amount.
The head of B&Q claims that the trend is explained by the presence of Eastern European masters working for little money.
According to Veronik Laurie, British people are increasingly employing repairs professionals.
The number of qualified workers in Eastern Europe is growing.

It is said that the British are placing in the direction of the melt and painting cysts, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to perform the work in the house.
If you know how to deal with silk or gently paint the walls, it seems that you are in a minority today.
Because, according to the owner company B&Q, the British are increasingly honoured to hire specialists-master to do the difficult work at home.
Veronika Laurie, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a network of home arrangement services, said that this trend is behind a significant flow of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in master products, and at the same time to close 60 B&Q stores.
Mrs. Laurie said she would like to see more women in the staff of the B&Q stores as eight out of ten shopping decisions are made by weak-sex representatives.
The majority of staff are now men.
According to her, it is not possible to ignore the latest demographic trends, characterized by the growing number of households consisting of single women who are more engaged in arranging their houses than in the past.
Mrs. Laurie said: “The majority of men still work in our stores.
We need to take steps to balance.
Overall, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of decisions about the purchased goods are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision making.
Mrs. Laurie, one of the five women in the leadership of leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the team of top managers, achieving among managers equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher is not the only company in which just 50 percent of managers are women, including CEO and Financial Director.
Mrs. Laurie said: “This was a conscious solution, diversification is an important question for us.
Finding the right women in the board was not difficult.
After the group took over the shutdown costs, Kingfisher showed a decrease in profits and sales in six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the brands Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new stores.
Time of decision on the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching the Federal Reserve meeting, which over two days discusses the most important decision - to raise or not the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that a little more than half of those who previous week believed the Federal Reserve would go on, now believe it would still temporarily and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event since it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve has lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time we approach that the main bank can move from the zero mark and begin the process of normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior employee at the Peterson Institute of International Economy.
The U.S. economy works efficiently, the economic rise adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should be prepared for changes, but it all tells about their confidence that all chances are against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: Refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
“Open!” – hundreds of refugees are scandalizing at the Horgosh checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has crossed the border for immigrants.
Asylum seekers are already starting to search for other routes to the European Union.
One of them on the closed border with Serbia lies through Romania.
Through Croatia and Slovenia to Austria.
According to some, the buses that carried refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now moving to the city of Shidu on the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without stops.
Serbian Minister of Internal Affairs Nebojša Stepanovich confirms that his country is doing everything depending on it to help refugees, but its possibilities are limited:
Our job is to safeguard Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we should also help these people, ensuring a human attitude to them.
But this is already a European problem.
To solve it is not easy, no country in Europe will solely deal with it, and even more such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia he must fill in the necessary documents.
And if he does not do that, he will not go into our country, because it is quite safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already built a 175-kilometre ceiling on the border with Serbia.
But Orbán does not intend to stop this: he plans to build the same ceiling on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Maymarakis: “Europe wants to help us.”
Vangelis Maymarakis for a number of years was part of the right-centrist governments, which, according to the left, led the country to a financial crisis.
Now he, becoming the temporary leader of the New Democracy party, is challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with the journalist Euronius.
Euronius: Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to Euronius!
Vangelis Maymarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronius: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat, withdrawing the Syriza coalition, but now, according to surveys, "New Democracy" has been compared to it by popularity.
What has changed over that time?
Vangelis Maymarakis: Greece has changed, and we too.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget defect and prospects for economic growth.
The country has a budget deficit and a high unemployment level.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras threw them out.
In the last nine months, the Greeks had the opportunity to evaluate the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare the promised with what actually happened.
Everyday life became significantly worse compared to January, when the situation improved, with the majority of Greeks.
Euronyus: But you say that if you win the election, you’ll pursue allies with other parties, including the Syriza.
Vangelis Maymarakis: The fact is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is not a coincidence that in all the other countries where the rescue programmes have been in operation or are still in operation, political forces and all the ruling parties have gathered together to implement the program they have reached agreement, without rejecting their political or ideological autonomy.
That’s why I firmly believe that at the present stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronyus: Your party has voted in support of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country’s creditors.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least partially?
VANGELIS MAYMARAKIS: In fact, we have voted for Greece’s move on the European path because we have a good idea of what harmful consequences the country’s withdrawal from the EU would have.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, Juncker’s package and banking assistance.
All this would be lost if there was no agreement with Europe.
But the current measures of hard savings were the result of Mr. Tsipras's negotiations.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government in the first year of power wants to set order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then I am confident that all the commitments that can not be fulfilled because they lead to a recession can again become the subject of negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of the new agreement we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect the agreement to be fully fulfilled.
If we want to restore their trust, we must continue the privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed, continuing to take advantage of the EU funding benefits and the big investment opportunities that we must open for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the government of Tsipras did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues that we found out by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give an example of the income of farmers.
We explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were answered that the ministers of Tsipras never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and poorly informed, and therefore they failed to negotiate and concluded a failed agreement.
If you win the election, you’ll soon be at one table with Mr. Juncker, Olland, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you say to them be different from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras said to them?
VANGELIS MAYMARAKIS: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014 we tried to fulfill the best way in the 2012 agreement, overlooking the sharp corners in it.
We advanced the reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in emergency circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers ready to pay the price arranged by the Greek government.
I was the speaker of the parliament at the time, and I managed to agree on the opinions of three parliamentary groups that were then a government majority.
And despite their serious ideological disagreements on key bills, we had a working parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations that took place outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by premature general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronyus: A mass flow of refugees has been moving across Greece in recent weeks.
What do you think about this situation and the reactions of the European countries that these people are looking for?
Vangelis Maymarakis: The refugee crisis is a slow action bomb that we have to deal with after the election victory.
And the reason is that the Syriza government did not act in this situation as it should.
In such matters you should act in advance, because if the problem reaches you, then only emergency measures remain.
We are now in this situation.
Even the temporary government that changed Syriza in just seven days did more than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the temporary government, to which the president of the Republic, who called for a summit of the EU, provides valuable assistance, will allow a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some emergency events that have occurred with them.
This issue has a profound humanitarian aspect, and we will adhere to the position that European politicians should take in this new situation.
The relevant decision must be adopted at the EU summit and the United Nations must be involved.
We also need better coordination, more efficient border control and refugee reception centers.
We must also effectively use the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this emergency problem.
Euronius: Mr. Maymaraks, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Maymarakis: I thank you.
In the peaceful city of Drzhkovka in the Donetsk region during the days, personnel of criminal investigation of the Main Administration of the police of the region together with the military counterintelligence established and detained the suspect, who was a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Kriva Rog (Dnepropetrovskaya region), who on the eve during the joint consumption of alcoholic beverages, and the conflict that occurred in the village of Vrchnetreck Yasinovatsky district of Donetsk shot from the automatic to his opponent.

The man who opened the shooting at the University of Delta left a note with apologies
After the shooting and murder of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note in which he said he "sorged" for the first murder and would like to "return everything back," the authorities said on Tuesday.
Police in the city of Goethe, Mississippi, reports that a professor of geography and public sciences at the University of Delta, called the service 911 around 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the inspector that the police should send people to him home.
He, “Yesterday evening I killed my wife,” and also mentioned that there is a “puppy” in the house that “no one will be touched,” but probably disappointed.
The police asked the name of the caller, but he did not call him.
Lamb didn’t explain why he opened the shooting.
After arriving at the scene, the police found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentice and a hand-written note from 45-year-old Lamb, in which it was said: "I'm sorry I'd like to get it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb travelled 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday evening, when he was surrounded by police, he killed himself.
University rector William Laforge said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb obviously had something in mind."
Despite Monday’s information that Lamb suggested a novel between Prentice and Schmidt, official services on Tuesday that “there was no information or evidence” of the “love triangle.”
Prentice was referred to as a "good man" by Sean O'Stein, who that he was married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Stein told me that he and Prentice have a daughter with 19, and that she's "unpleasant."
He added that Prentice and her daughter were “best friends.”
According to Lindsey Noulz, who the San Gerald newspaper calls her close friend, Prentice, the latter worked from home through the internet.
Noulz told me that Prentice had a hunting dog by Lightning, and that she met Lamb for about three years.
Noulz said, “She always wanted to help people.”
According to the police, Lamb on Monday at some point called his relatives to say that "he will not go to prison."
In the evening of the same day, when the police reached him on the highway "1" near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, fled into the forest and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university website, in the spring of 2015, Lamb received a doctorate degree in pedagogics at the State University of Delta.
The Stars Who Lost Happiness
The actor (left), on the photo with his son Redmond (right), survived a few difficult years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term life companion, Farrou Fossett, who died of cancer.
The actor also suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug storage.
All of this, of course, played its role.
Luke Shaw left Manchester United for several months due to double break
Luke Show broke his right leg in two places during the Champions League match in which Manchester United lost PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defendant is experiencing this issue, which will not be able to get out of the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that the show will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during the discretion of Hector Moreno in the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Show was swallowed into the PSV penalty zone.
He was assisted on the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, “He has a double break and he is in the hospital.”
He will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or later and then operated.
It's terrible - the boy came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcome great difficulties and began to play fantastic, and here it happened.
There was an oxygen mask on the clothes.
He was crying.
I’m not a doctor, but if you have a double break, then it’s for six months, and the guy won’t be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and had no penalty.
Arbitrator Nicola Riccoli has not punished the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge yourself when I say it is worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad climb with two legs.
The show tweeted: “Thank you all for your messages, words not to describe how devastated I am, my way to recovery begins, I’m going to return even stronger than it was.”
Manchester United experiences misfortune with Luke Show when defeated in the game with PSV
The defender of the British will have an additional incentive to go back to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coco, PSV coach, said: “It’s a very serious injury.”
When any player comes out with such a trauma, everyone is very disappointed with it.
It was never the intention of our players - to hurt the enemy.
Moreno suffered a break in his leg when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under the leadership of Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very difficult now because he didn't intend to hurt the enemy, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, you're feeling bad," Coco said.
I didn’t have the opportunity to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was flying in a different direction so it seemed like he (Moreno) touched him, but I didn’t see a subcut under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to tolerate.
I am very hard, and I am very sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smoling.
Did David Cameron know anything else about Lorraine?
Every parent very quickly absorbs one thing: if your child liked a book, it will take a little time before you wake up knowing it almost suddenly.
You are not David Cameron.
Answering the question of a representative of the company that organizes children's holidays, about his favorite children's book, the prime minister chose "Loraks" - a fairy tale with an ecological depth, written by Dr. Susan in 1971.
This was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment on SuperCamps’ website, and continues: “This fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children because it always finds some image or message that we miss.”
And it would be fine, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to recount the content of the book, but actually tells the story of the same-name film taken in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify a fairly short original story.
“In the city surrounded by the high walls of the universe, where there was no green and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to conquer the heart of Audrey – the girl of his dream, fulfilling her desire – to see the real tree,” – we read in the text a description of the love story of the unknown Dr. Susan (the real name Theodor Susan Gaysel), who died in 1991.
If it doesn’t seem suspicious enough, Cameron’s text is read almost as a short explanation of the story of the film “Loraks”, published on the Internet Movie Database: “In the high walls surrounded by the city of Wemnuzhville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to conquer the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dream.”
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being, in general recognition, an active parent, so unknown with the content of a book, in which the unnamed boy learns about how the environment is destroyed by a thirsty tree robber and the "needless" crawler Nakhkins, despite the protests of Lorax (who's name brought to the title of the book) - a funny creature with the ears, who "speaks in the name of the trees."
Probably, such a simple PR task was assigned to an artist who never read a book about Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street representative said the text was supposedly received from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments followed.
For Adam Lita, there was obviously the risk of not getting into the England team, but this is still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you look at the team that England has chosen for this tour, the repetition of the defeat in the test series with the score of 3-0 last time seems unlikely to me.
I would not exclude the victory on my field.
The team of Alister Cook may be less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but among the rebounds there are players who virtually take the rolled balls, and collective thinking strong; they will not bring with them the 2012 shrams, but only the youth positive.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into a bowler giving rounded balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Adam Lith left England for test cricket and replaced by Alex Hayles
The decision to exclude Adam Lith to me, his main coach in Yorkshire, is of course difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but cruel reality is that the players in the cricket are assessed by judges by the result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, what led to this announcement because (and I’ve said it before) players are best choosing themselves.
A couple of half a hundred, and Lita could expect a longer career, but he was in the power of his own fate.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
England's chief coach, Trevor Bailes, was good about his mood, even when he didn't show what he was able to do, and that doesn't surprise me; he's first a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the test cricket Batman leaves an impression is a difficult question.
Lith played in seven games like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton in nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play on his own and on the stranger field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trotta for the Caribbean Premier League when Lith was in the best form, but this lost opportunity is already in the past.
There’s Alex Hales, and he’s a Batman whom I appreciate very much.
He is an unpredictable cricketer that we saw in the Yorkshire club at the beginning of this season, when he earned 236 in a match against us at the Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as those who were before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of placing Moane next to Cook as an opening batsman, which would give the opportunity to introduce an additional spinner, retaining four speed boulers, is considered, and I’m not against it at all.
I don’t see the reasons why the beat player can’t beat the ball there, and this left has already shown that he’s a good cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what it needs for his Wustershire county, but it became the third number for them, and there is no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches as a "third Batman" before going out as an opening in 2001.
He won three hundred and did not look.
Zafar Ansary comes to the team as a reserve spinner, and with my short contact with him he appeared to me as a very promising young man.
People can look at his example statistics - an average of 31 with a bit and 35 with a ball - and think it's a risk rate, but among the spiners voting "for" a little, and the voters chose youth.
He will learn a lot in this tour.
In addition to the team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coach's composition.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a test match consultant, could be a workshop course.
He is one of the best guys for the game, which will bring to it the richest experience obtained under all possible conditions and in any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and unpleasant pace in the setup.
I’ve always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it’s a game or a trainer’s job, and like Mahela, he has a great intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the clothes, even if they say what has been said earlier, can add new strength to the team.
Collega Coley in Darem's team Ben Stoke was left for one day, Rutu was given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, don't have any problems with it.
Although not everyone will agree with this, the coaches and people who choose players don’t set a schedule.
And you need to remember how players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never made easily.
The camp of supporters of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union could win if the economy is in depression by 2017
David Cameron's unthinkable policy of renewing negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU is experiencing more and more difficulties every day, even without reviewing the election of the genius Jeremy-"This is yes or not?"- Corbyn as a Labour leader or TUC's anger about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigels Farage.
A friendly European diplomat explained in the days that, in the situation in which the EU is now experiencing a variety of crises – not all of them of its own production – some of the participating countries are stuck on the throat of the British egocentric agenda that sows the breakthroughs and undermines the agreement of changes that they mainly do not want.
Meeting in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that he didn’t want them anyway if they destroy social protection.
We could even call it "David and George's selfie program."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance ride on summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves on the background of a famous local monument, in the company of a local celebrity or without it, then come home and say they attract allies for reform.
This is all about me.
My European friend, who wants the interested inining external contacts with Britain under the tint of the European Union – “Don’t leave us with France,” says Berlin – suggests that shy ministers and officials in some capitals come to understanding when they’ll have no matter whether we’ll stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious German chancellor, is a ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation for her becomes worse, as she becomes worse for those sitting on her place Thatcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Cole (16).
French President François Hollande is ahead of re-election or replacement in 2017.
He also loses strength.
Poland could soon get a nationalist government of the right-wing, Spain of the left.
It was hard to see them leaving out of the skin to help the selfie-British whose energy could be spent to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK—which they also don’t want, because most people have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to issue intentionally useless SNP-style notes during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to stimulate the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The review was a fixed idea" and "The UK has not received anything valuable from the renewed negotiations."
Europeans know what the fighter Flitt Street can be, and how skeptical the media magnates are to the EU, unlike the times of Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
They can confusedly remember Boris Johnson, a cracked Euro-opportist who was famous for his "direct EU bananas" of the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a dwarf company of tax-threatening bullshit, telephone hackers-strangers and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the same opinion about them, but he gave himself a note that when you are in a cage with a bull gorilla, you have to give her bananas to pull her away and not let her eat you on a lanch and again with tea.
According to the fact, Milliband was a bigger Blair supporter than Blair himself in opposition to Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair took the principles in favour of the abolished EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press did not forgive him anything.
But the gentleman Jeremy Corbyn, who friendly hunted me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he no longer had time to spend it on me - seems to be at risk of repeating Neil Kinok's "Merdock Boycott" strategy from the 80s - a mistake and then, and now.
It may take time, but he must develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press – not with me, but quite exactly with Andrew Marr, whose sofa in the Air Force he sat on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Indeed, the majority of people beyond Ukip’s tradiocinalistic trend and a wider circle of “Little England’s supporters” among the tours may probably say “yes” to that.
It’s the same what Hillary – “Ben, but not Benit,” Ben said on radio and television this week, while his internal boycott with all the strength refused to admit that the appointment of Corbyn’s foolish John McDonald’s as a “shadow” finance minister was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s, when his old-father fought on TV for unloyality to his colleagues in the Labour Cabinet, not going too far and not losing his post in the Cabinet of Ministers.
The Battle of Hillary was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay "in any circumstances" - Ben's phrase - is not what McDonnell said, and not what J.K. said to parliaments and parliaments at a private meeting on Monday evening, according to the general opinion.
In order to inform the Democrat and his “friend” Corbyn – remember, he touched even me – the discipline of messages remains important in the century of 24-hour television seven days a week, and especially in the waterfront of social networks, the center of paranoia and betrayal.
It is reasonable not to let Cameron so easily separate from Europe, allowing him to take as the right support of Labourists during the referendum campaign, as McDonald said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonald’s and Corbyn’s main misconception about membership in the EU – within the framework of the “Bennitic” economy of the occupied fortress – is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among the left dissidents, for whom narcissism, generated by a small distinction, is the central principle in dogmatic disputes.
When it comes to his misconceptions about NATO, Tom Watson is uncommon in the fact that J.K. will not argue for the departure – foreign diplomats will be forced to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why do Paris or Berlin spend political capital – they also have suspicious voters – on the departure of Britain, when all this can be meaningless?
The U.S. is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the government of Tory has cut off the expenses, which I was reminded on Monday during a runch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
The government-financed statements that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking were heard at the meeting of 12 people, some of whom are related to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its e-cigarette report.
The PHE published an important report - a "reversal wave" last month, calling it "a comprehensive review of evidence."
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the contact of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial article in the medical magazine Lancet last month criticized the "extremely narrow argument" on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers asked whether these statements have “hard or subtle grounds”.
Martin McKee, a professor of the European Health Organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of health - rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
According to them, the public expects that PHE statements that "the current best rating shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco" were based on detailed evidence analysis and modeling.
In fact, this is derived from a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multicriterial decision-making analysis model to summarize their opinions about the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are briefly listed in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, the chief executive of which was to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent research.
He also confirmed the health certificates of BAT in the Sustainable Development Report.
One in twelve people on the meeting announced the funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, not to mention the funding he was to have previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the election of the board members, but among them there are several well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also stated that the industry was funded in the publication.
It is unknown whether other participants have experience in the tobacco business.
The meeting was also visited by the head of the tobacco direction at PHE.
The scientific article, published by the group, “willfully agree” with the fact that there is a lack of “weight evidence of the harmful effects of most products according to most criteria,” McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, no of these links and restrictions were affected in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's statements that "at the moment there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smokers to smoke" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Wellbeing at PHE, said that BMJ's statements were previously answered.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco."
One of the two smokers died all his life from their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health threats from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we should continue to study the remote consequences.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and does not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger compared to to tobacco.
About 80,000 people per year die from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs NHS at £2 billion per year.
Clearly pointing out the obvious – that although e-cigarettes are not safe, they only cause a part of the damage caused by smoking – we fulfill our tasks before the nation.
Former chief of Channel 4 believes BBC should stop the EastEnders series
Former Channel 4 chief Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop broadcasting such programs as EastEnders and The Voice, noticing that their business competitors would give a lot for such successful shows as the soap opera about "Albert Square".
Johnson noted that the license fees should only be used to create programs that are not produced by other British radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for the company placing public broadcasts that probably only a small portion of the audience will watch, at the peak time when competitors have high-ranking shows, and on channels like the BBC4.
After the BBC chief executive Tony Hall said the corporation would want to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that he in his time for six years failedly tried to establish cooperation with the BBC while working on Channel 4.
"I can't get away from the idea that the BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting broadcasts that could show competing companies that don't receive subsidies," Johnson told members of the House of Lords' Communications Committee as part of the BBC's further fate.
If you keep the license collection that I don’t consider a good solution in the medium and long-term, then the company should leave in broadcast only those programs that are not produced and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice show is broadcast in the premium slate because the creators want to get the most possible support for the future.
The idea that no one will show it anymore is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: “I don’t understand why regressive taxes should go to transfer funding that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice - one such example, EastEnders - another; it is commonly known that they are their own production.
Other channels would undoubtedly give much for it.
I don’t understand how this can be a public broadcast.
I don’t think that would undermine the BBC.
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing the ratings “for employees’ ambitions and for their belief that this is the best way to get long-term support.”
His comments on the BBC’s most popular shows are linked with the comments of Sky’s executive director Tony Boll, who in his memorial lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed the BBC to sell series like EastEnders.
Johnson noted that more niche broadcasts of the BBC's public character "continue to go on the BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audience, but the company's function is performed, and this can be submitted as an argument in the Khan's prophecies justifying the income from licensing fees of £4 billion: "No yes, of course, we do all these incomprehensible broadcasts that no one will watch."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever look at them.
About the license collection, Johnson told the committee the following: "I call on you to find a more regressive system with regard to who will get the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds per year is a huge amount, but for people for whom 150 pounds are big money, I am interested, they think so because they don’t really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former Executive Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should review Rita's mission in favour of "inform, enlighten and entertain".
He noted that now only a small part of the BBC’s materials are formally classified as educational – according to him, it is 1% of television content and 0.1% on radio – and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasting companies under the motto “inform, illuminate and entertain”.
On partnership issues, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "Change Concerts" (only a part of them, he said, is shown on TV), as well as join alliances with commercial broadcasting companies to make them available for online viewing.
Sonogenetics allows you to control brain cells using sound waves.
The video shows how nematodes change the direction of movement at the time they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have extracted worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound wave pulses.
Small nematodes change the direction of movement at the time when they are affected by sound impulses too high that the human ear can hear them.
Impulse is influenced by activating genetically modified neurons to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Researchers Manage Brain Activity With Light
Scientists said that the intestines demonstrate the possibilities of a new method called "sonogenetics", the essence of which is the use of ultrasound to stimulate certain brain, heart and muscle cells, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Shricant Chalasani, a scientist at the Solk Institute, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation – an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and which is used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
Nematodic worms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalassani found that they began to react when they were placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles strengthen the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worm's body.
Enhanced ultrasound waves affect structures called "TRP-4 ion channels" found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open up and excite the cells that are connected to them, reports in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalassani made genetic modifications of worms, so their motor neurons used the TRP-4 ion channels.
During the use of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were strengthened by microscopic bubbles and was introduced into worm organisms, activating modified motor neurons.
This method is similar to the one that is applied in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to enable and unlock neurons with the help of light impulses.
Chalasani claims that in comparison with this method, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the right area of the brain through the optowave, low-frequency ultrasound waves pass through the body's tissues without obstacles, so they don't need to go through the cranial box to deliver them.
“We believe that for the treatment of some neurological diseases in clinical conditions the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal in time,” Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the methodology can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment - right at your threshold!
Advertisements on Britain's weapons trade
Watch Amnesty International’s video of protests against the arms exhibition.
Awesome drone killer!
Destroying the naked iron candles!
The Caset Bombs!
Electric light and noise depths that cause unbearable pain, but do not leave any traces!
The sharp voice and painted animation leave no doubt that this advertising of the largest international arms exhibition is a sharp parody prepared by Amnesty International to attract attention to the British government’s intention to “touch” weapons to repressive regimes, taking advantage of the exhibition of defense technologies and security systems that takes place at ExCeL Center in Doclands.
DSEI Arms Exhibition: Authoritarian Regimes Go to London
But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of a number of posters on bus stops and in the subway trains, which require to look at them again.
"A significant announcement on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them by the fonts of the London Metro with an image of the DLR line that turns into a silhouette of a tank.
In September this year, a crowd of weapons traders will hit the DLR line. passengers are asked to help prevent the weapons exhibition.
300 posters were drawn by the artists who exhibited their works at the “Museum of Cruel Design” in the Banksy Park Dismaland.
The “Special Patrol” group has helped spread them across London, using “a set of advertising sites breakthrough,” a 6-pound set of hook keys, which, according to the statement, “ gives access to about a third of the advertising space on the bus stops of the planet.”
The London carriers were unhappy with such "wandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parodial announcements issued by the Group "Special Patrol".
According to Gavin Grindon, the Cruel Designs exhibition curator and professor at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and seeking to bring political art to the audience outside the galleries.
Many artists begin to work with protest movements activists, realizing that they have to go out in the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the weapons exhibition, welcoming passengers in the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by the pro bono VCCP agency, with graphic designer and sound artist attracting also working for free.
VCCP’s creative director Matt Lever was shocked by the advertising silence around the arms exhibition – with a breakthrough in the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s organize them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They thought to create more realistic and smart corporate advertising, but "to fill her home with bright flowers and animation was more exciting."
“They incredibly helped us attract attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition,” says Tom Davis from Amnesty.
Now we need the UK government to take measures and ensure that this torture equipment will not illegally be sold right at our threshold.
Per the most creative art on the theme of the weapons exhibition comes from the interior of ExCeL, where participants trade fantasticly euphemetic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed information about the order on the "AT4CS RS for shooting from the shoulder," received from the U.S. Army.
It includes a “no-analogous cumulative battle line that brings unbeatable reservation effect inside the target.”
Whatever he does, it will not be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules of Living in Student Accommodations
It’s been 11 years since I moved to a student hostel as a normal 19-year-old man, still believing in bitterness and moral relativism, but only now I remember the narrow smiles of those I’ve irritated – and the numerous, long complaints of others.
Basically, what I learned can be divided by eight simple rules.
Moving to the hostel can vary from slightly nervous to absolutely scary.
He encourages to blame: tell people where you came from, whether you took academic holidays and where you spent it, whether you support Corbyn and why you “honestly, I don’t love or hate Marmite,” because, seriously, guys, it’s just a moisturizing HAHAHA extract, I’ll be with you.”
and rest.
And help others rest as well - ask questions and show interest.
This supports the conversation and helps you find people you like, not those with whom you’t even talk, even if you’d burn your bracelets and they’d distribute firefighters.
Give people space.
People’s rooms are often converted into dining facilities, midnight cinemas, and places for public clothes, but they are also the place where people dress and repair their underwear.
Also on the topic: Do not even think of starting a college study while in a relationship
Introverses in universities are unfair.
Your room should be a refuge, but many hostels form a culture of shedding from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long friendly relationships.
It can be a hell for those who are trying to restore strength.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to go, and I have been able to restore the energy I spent on communicating with you."
Try to feel when a complainant is tired of communication - and don't scream to him, but send a SMS.
By the way, about the shock: do it.
One guy in my hostel followed this principle: if the door was not closed, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Factory of friends with the help of baking.
As you start a university life at the peak of popularity of the Bake-Off show, then knocking in the door to people to present and present a cake of chocolate, - no longer such a strange action, not so reminds the 1950s with their "Goodbye, we are neighbors, I showed you something, and now smile, and I will ask you personal questions."
Providing household food is a great way to get friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to fight with you, and in the end, your face will probably be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are.
Badly blind cakes of flour, sugar, and fat will make people feel asleep when you’re going to cling to them.
Food theft is a typical crime in student houses.
Of course, giving someone a chicken is a robbery, but is it a robbery to take a little milk for tea?
Go to the owner of milk.
Probably he will offer you not to be ashamed, even if it is boiled from anger inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it’s annoying, and I’m compassionate for you – but try to treat this adult than my neighbor who wrapped in her milk liquid to wash dishes to revenge those who took it without demand.
She is now in prison.
You should not produce noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the proverb about glass houses.
A girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to calm the sound of the bubble and the bass guitar as it was 3 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the noise.
When he finally silenced at 5 a.m., she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours, and then scratched her music and closed the door behind herself, going to a three-hour exam.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse settled in the same hostel as you?
On the contrary, it would not be extraordinary, before kissing the lock, unlocked, if you accepted the neighbor for your future spouse, captured them, broke the relationship and should see him every day, and watch how he stretches to his side all your common friends?
Of course, the heart will not be commanded - but if the hot neighbor is not your future spouse, try to cool your own dust slightly.
At that exciting moment when you realize that someone has left the keys inside your own closed room, the boundary between the play and the grass is thinner than it seems.
A good play is fun, but it turns into its opposite in a few seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something – but never pack someone’s room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Close the other’s door and drop the keys into a glass of water that you then put in the refrigerator – but don’t stick the other’s things with a Blu-Tack glue to the roof more than twice.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on the iPhone after Apple releases an update
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, select General, and then Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some had problems after installing when a error message appears saying that "App Update failed."
To avoid this, users are advised either to wait until the recovery is silent, or to try to update through iTunes.
Signs on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may include the removal of apps to increase the free space – but Apple has minimized the probability of this action by reducing the size of the update, and has also simplified the execution using a special utility that offers to remove apps and reinstall them after the process is completed.
It is important to make sure that when you do the update, your phone is charged or is next to the charging device, so that the battery is not charged.
If the charging is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the phone’s charging in the process may lead to a failure in the update.
iOS 9 comes as planned despite the late WatchOS Review of iOS 9: the least impressive and best iOS 9 update: how to prepare for the new operating system for iPhone
You should make sure you have checked our checklist of the actions you need to do before downloading to try and force something to stop going wrong, and protect yourself from it if something went wrong. iOS 9 now includes new features, including an enhanced personal assistant, and innovations that improve the performance of the iPad, as well as settings that increase the speed of work and correct the operating system.
Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone call.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
According to him, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad only leads to an exacerbation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about this with a Russian colleague, PJ Media writes.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss Russia’s military activity in Syria.
This is by PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry clearly made it clear that the further support of President Assad from Russia creates a risk of aggravation and prolongation of the conflict, and also negatively affects our overall goal - fighting extremism - unless we also continue to focus on the search for ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through the immediate transfer of power," the U.S. State Department said.
They also noted that Kerry once again emphasized the commitment of the United States to fight the Islamic State within a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be a member of it.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with the constructive role of Russia in attempts to counter the Islamic State.”
Last Friday, White House officials said they don’t know exactly what actions the Russian troops are taking in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, White House spokesman Josh Ernest noted that the time for the telephone conversation between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet arrived: "When the president decides that the telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will lift the tube and try to make that call."
Barack Obama himself considers the decision of Russia to increase the support of the Assad regime as a "progressive bet".
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake, that the further support of Assad would only worsen the situation.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and as a result, the situation worsened," the US president said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from the payment of customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily free imported yachts and other floating equipment for recreation and sports from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding amendments to the list of favourable goods for temporary tax-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
This was by the Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Lashkina.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev, following a visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of ministries - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the FSB, the FTS, and the Rosturism - to prepare proposals on the creation of favourable conditions for yachting in coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
The owners prefer to store their vessels abroad – approximately €200 million annually goes to the treasury of European states for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "About amendments to the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties, taxes", which provides for the provision of full conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports.
According to the ministry, this will contribute to the creation of favourable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, Lashkina noted.
This question was raised to the subcommittee on customs and tariff regulation, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade of the Government Commission on economic development and integration, the meeting of which took place in September, and according to the results of the discussion was also approved by the departments.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure for full conditional exemption of imports is in its essence a benefit.
Therefore, after approval of the protocol of the subcommittee meeting in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the Member States of the EAEU, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are fully exempt from the payment of customs duties, taxes, include the goods necessary for the promotion of foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for applications in the field of science, culture, cinema, sports and tourism, for the provision of international assistance, etc. Among them - service equipment (personal computers, writing machines), control-measurement devices, storm equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skies, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, music instruments and objects for religious events.
In the press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation "Izvestij" told that they have prepared mandatory decrees on the sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Theodosius and Euphoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for the registration of the departure and departure of small, sports vessels and passenger vessels in the sea port.
The Ministry of Transport has commissioned the captains of the ports of Crimea to ensure the application of the simplified order of the entry of small, sports passenger and passenger vessels into the sea port and the exit of the listed vessels from the sea port.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also prepared the draft orders of the Russian government on approval of the boundaries of the sea ports of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Theodosius, the orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the stage of agreement, the ministry said in a press service.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the state supervision, classification and inspection, the state registration of small vessels used for non-profit purposes must be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting just because of poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look to the south of Italy and France, then there is a whole constantly developing industry that involves a large number of people.
In Russia, everything is in place.
Our coast is little interesting, the only piece where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelenjik, Novorussia, Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that in this area the rules of border service are extremely strict: in order to go out on the yacht to walk, you need to form a mass of permissions.
In Russia, the yacht has no place to go.
It can go with its fuel for two days, and then there is a problem where to take it, says Nordmarine’s sales director Denis Novikov.
As for places for storage of yachts, there are now special angars for yachts up to 30 m in Moscow and St. Petersburg and the yachts are also sent for storage to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that the buyers of yachts are rich people, but with the beginning of the crisis the demand for yachts decreased.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was by the press service of the international organization.
“The new funding will support a number of priority measures to carry out reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine,” the statement said.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Cimeo Fan, said that the reforms of the banking sector will help restore loans in the real economy and will stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps on the reform of the economy and the World Bank observes the first signs of stabilization.
But due to the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the government of Ukraine to accelerate the reforms.
Previously, the Polish government approved the grant of a loan of €100 million to Ukraine, reports RIA Novosti.
In prisons they are asked to create separate blocks for transgender persons.
At the Public Council of the Federal Penalty Execution Service (FSI) on the protection of the rights of the convicted in October 2015 among other issues will discuss the possibility of creating in colonies separate blocks for transgender and transvestites.
This was by the member of the board Vladislav Gryb.
According to him, depending on the total number in Russia of condemned, not identified with gender, in domestic prisons it is possible to provide separate chambers, blocks or even (if such criminals will be many) in the future to create a special colony for transgender.
However, Vladislav Gryb emphasizes that determining the punishment of citizens in such isolated places is possible only after the convicted pass appropriate medical examinations that will prove that the criminal is actually a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Gryb is confident that the isolation of transgender persons from other prisoners will ensure the safety of punishments.
According to him, the proposed practice is successfully operating abroad: in the CISO (where the accused are before the court's decision) separate chambers are provided for transgender, and in the corrective institutions - special blocks.
Today, this is the only way to work with such criminals.
Certainly they need to be isolated, as the presence of transvestites and transgender in ordinary cameras is dangerous for them, it is a suffering for their families and a sea of problems for the FSIN employees.
The humiliation of the trends by the socomers is guaranteed, says Vladislav Gryb.
Depending on how big the city, how many criminals with uncertain gender, it is necessary to calculate where to distribute them.
CISOs are not precisely needed - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if transgender will be a lot.
As Gryb explained, the block can contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized body will be created in Russia one, then transgender prisoners will be able to enter the punishment from any region.
Citizens are kept in the CISO at the place of the crime, so the receipt of transvestites or transgender from other subjects during the investigation and judicial process is unrealistic, but to introduce such practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, - says Gryb.
The law enforcement officials were unable to decide in which investigative isolator - male or female - to identify the detained for drug storage 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kojukov (known under the name Alina Davis), for which man with a virgin appearance was not arrested.
He was released home under the signature.
This news was widely discussed on social networks and the media, as the transgender content mechanism in the CISO and colonies in Russia is actually not yet.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT movement activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for transgender punishment, noting that abroad it is also possible to define people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is right.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of ensuring security in prisons for homosexuals, says Alekseev.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be made in this name and for homosexuals, even more that they are in prisons more than transgender.
At the same time, Alekseev doubts that there will be a lot of citizens in Russia who are ready to give up themselves as transsexual in order to get into a different colony than usual.
Of course, you can introduce medical examination before placing people in a transgender colony, but not always everything is unclear.
For example, in the U.S., one of the prisoners Chelsea Manning looked like a man, and already in prison said he wanted to change gender, - said Alekseev.
A person can feel anyone.
But while there are no separate places for transgender punishment, I doubt that prison workers will think seriously about the safety of such people and get into the subtlety of their orientation or gender identification.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health on the territory of the Russian Federation, Boris Lordipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transgender criminals in the colony could significantly delay the beginning of the punishment of the convicted.
A commission is created - this is a question of sexology, psychiatrists carry out long-term observations, this is not a single test, on the basis of which a highly accurate conclusion is made.
The possibilities of psychiatry today allow it.
Therefore, before the change of gender, potential patients are always undergoing such examinations - they are clearly showing whether the change of gender with surgery is the necessary measure, says Lordkipanidze.
However, it’s hard for me to imagine how this system will be implemented in relation to the convicted, because it takes an average of a month for such an investigation.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general the idea of creating separate blocks for transgender supported, also doubts that in current economic conditions it will be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, - transgender in Russia units.
It is difficult to calculate, there is no official statistics, but if we take into account that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, then we can say that transgender people are even less, and those who have such deviation and are still committing crimes, a very small number, - said Lordkipanidze.
Now on request before the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgender and so can get separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the junior world championship in chess.
In Hantha-Mansysk ended the world championship in chess among youths under the age of 20.
The end of the first round was more than interesting.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and he became the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who was still able to push the Polish Jan-Kshistof Dudu, who seemed to be sure to go to the title.
The victory was celebrated by the Ukrainian chess player Natalia Bux.
The World Chess Championship, which took place since the beginning of September in Hanty-Mansysk, already in the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all the intrigue, as Polish representative Jan-Kshistof Duda, who issued a series of four victories (competitions are held on the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently captured the leadership.
Given that Duda was the ranking-favorites of the championship and is considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he will miss the gained break appeared very small.
And even when Duda slowed down the turn and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to cut his departure to just 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favourite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipow, to reach the leader, had to necessarily win in the 13th round.
But even that would not help, win Duda your party.
Plus this obligation of victory, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently dealt with Francesco Rambaldy, after which he was forced to wait for his party to be completed by Duda, who met with Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately, for Antipova, the Polish chess player dropped the confrontation with the Dutch.
Thus, Antipov and Duda gained the same number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
And that’s why the leadership of the Hanty-Mansy Autonomous District, the governor of which Natalia Komarov, traditionally gives great attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded the main prize.
But in the girls’ competitions, an interesting end did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalie Buxe (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the last round, what she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russians, Alina Bivol, did not allow her to reach the Box.
The Russian athlete remained second with a deviation from the champion in 0.5 points.
It changes the regional structure.
The company unites the Volga and Ural regions into one aggregated Volga and Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - to the East region.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Addressed food assistance will not be an analogue of cards in the USSR.
Vice-Ministry of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Evtuchov said that the program of address food assistance will not be an analogue to the card food distribution system existing in the USSR.
It is about modern addressed food assistance to the population and the support of an effective domestic product producer.
I ask you not to speculate on the word "food card".
It should be noted that it is not necessary to confuse the offered product cards with the outlook of the past periods of total deficit, the card system of distribution, in which the number of received products is normalized.
We have so far proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose amendments to the legislation,” Yutukhov said.
Earlier, "Ъ" wrote that the program for introducing food cards for the poor was introduced to the government.
More details about the initiative of the Ministry of Agriculture read in the material "Ъ" "Igor Shuvalov ordered to prepare food cards".

This year, the survey of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" comes out for the 16th time.
As an instrument of assessing the professional reputation of Russian senior managers, the study submits the results of the work of Russian managers for a year, identifying leaders in industries and functional directions.
The initial number of candidates consists of the winners of last year’s ranking.
The winners of last year are offered to confirm their participation as the current year’s ranking candidate and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the original list is proposed to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, which would be appropriate to add to the total crowd of candidates.
It is possible to appoint the following managers of the functional areas of the company: the financial director, the commercial director, the marketing director, the staff director, the IT director, the director of public and corporate relations, the director of relations with authorities, the director of corporate management.
Each proposed expert manager is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to present his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The presentation of candidates according to the industry principle is carried out on the basis of the industry classification of the Association of managers: information technology, commercial banks, forest and forest processing industry, machinery, media business, metallurgy, multidisciplinary holdings, professional services, communication and telecommunications, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to log in to the site www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the other participants and can make their assessments according to the criteria proposed for each functional direction.
The basis of the ratings building methodology is the principle "Best chooses the best": top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle allows you to get the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of the expert committees.

The names of companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the rules "Ъ".
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfortable rate for investment credit is 10-13%.
According to experts, the small and medium-sized business loan market in January-April of this year rose by 40%.
What do you think is the situation today?
After the panic mood from the end of 2014 to the beginning of 2015, the amount of loans of the MSB has decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp rise in interest rates.
Loans under 25-30% per year were not profitable to anyone.
If previously the bank could put all its possible problems in the future, from delays to non-refunds, then now it is impossible to do this: rates and so cloudy.
For, the current rate on the credit rates of the MSB is uncomfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their recovery.
The interest rate of 10-13% would allow a business to invest in a wide range of projects and form attractive profitability.
How much is the demand of entrepreneurs for loans?
After the lower interest rate, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources are becoming more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects of its development and future revenue.
Today, business has one way: it is necessary to learn to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more carefully, to monitor the flow of money.
At the same time, with the presence of financial resources, it is worth using new technologies that allow modernization of equipment, reducing production and energy costs.
All of this ultimately enables the company to make the product more competitive and maintain the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the IAS credit market will strengthen and will affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for a lower average rate will largely depend on the Central Bank’s policy, and now the regulator is demonstrating consistency in the issue of the lower key rate.
However, a radical fall in the credit price for the MSB is not worth waiting.
In the current situation, the problem, first and foremost, is inflation, which makes the necessary high interest rate to get real income.
In addition, the cost of the money in Russia will remain high even if the interest rates of the central bank are down.
When it comes to the level of delay, it is traditionally that small and medium-sized enterprises, limited both in the possibilities of funding and in the options of economic behavior correction, will surely be a greater risk for creditors.
I would not expect a significant decrease in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is the international sanctions and their negative impact on the country’s economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written by Japanese hieroglyphs.
Beautiful, laconic and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
The new CX-5 crossover, like any other brand model, is attractive outside, technically made inside.
The Japanese is already simply because of its "Japanese" being able to bring the attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of full enthusiasm.
You can bring arguments in favour of machines from other countries, and a person even in principle will agree with these arguments, but the whole conversation will disappear from the final phrase: "But this is the same Japanese car!
I do not argue about anything!
Such people probably should love not only the technique, but all the other Japanese.
Citating from the course of the Bases, cooking a vasabi food, collecting cats and dressing your girlfriend - no, not in the kimono, of course, but by the canons of street Japanese fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
Per, the Japanese school form is the only form that girls enjoy and after graduation.
It has amazing properties: both sensitive and strict at the same time.
The older the girl, the shorter the jacket.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But much more strongly changes the appearance of the car the new picture of the lights and the rear lights, by which the car is immediately recognized in the car flow.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensitive, but the appearance is strict.
You don’t have to call the police.
By driving the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can only experience the stoic Japanese tranquility.
The 2.2-L diesel engine provides a high rotating moment in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a power of 175 l. s.- just 5.9 l. The power unit is equipped with exclusively automatic transmission and full drive.
Black shoes, black shirt, black bag.
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose legins with a print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, the Mazda has made the most effort to ensure that the CX-5 drive you are not on the site of your own accident.
In order to further enhance the comfort, while retaining excellent controlability, the headset reworked the structure of the front and rear amortisers, as well as optimized the shape of the front and rear slopes.
The full drive system is adapted to the Russian conditions.
The noise level from road and motor at high speeds is reduced by 13%.
The bathroom in a flower or strip is as tired as a budget sedan.
The other thing is if a girl climbs in a bathroom with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of a role-playing fighter.
She will then get no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both the front and the rear seats, which provides an optimal space reserve for both the wide shoulders and for the long legs.
Even long-powered people will surely appreciate that the tensions in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not beat on the slopes in the winds.
The wider range of Mazda Active Security systems is available on the CX-5.
To identify the potential threat, radars, laser and cameras are used here.
There is both adaptive lighting, and the warning of departure from the strip, and the monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 is one of the best suitcases in the class.
Comfortable, with a minimum of outputs, it holds a cargo of 561 l. The rear seats are composed in a proportion of 4:2:4 - each section is equipped with a separate drawing bar - and increase the baggage section to 1560 l.
The costume of the cartoon hero in Japan is called "Kiguru".
The pyjamas look especially gentle.
Everything can be in it!
Of course to sleep.
Have fun with small children.
Or just walking with such a beast on the street.
After all, it’s so nice when there’s the opportunity to choose – clothes, behavior or car.
Thank you for the help in the preparation of the material shop Kawaicat.
Kiev destroyed the nuclear union.
Kiev has officially formalized the refusal of Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the construction of the Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant.
The Supreme Council on Wednesday after the second attempt still voted for the dissolution of the agreement with Moscow.
The agreements on the upgrading of the third and fourth blocs were signed in 2010-2012, but the implementation of the project was never achieved.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted a law repealing the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth bloc on the Chmelnitsk nuclear power station.
The draft law was made by the government only from the second vote, the first time it was supported by 210 Deputies at the necessary minimum of 226, but then, when the draft was re-voted, 234 members of the parliament voted.
The Chmelitskaya nuclear power plant under the USSR according to the original project had to count four energy blocks per 1 GW with VVER reactors, but they managed to build only two.
Negotiations with Moscow on the upgrade led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and in 2011-2012, the Council adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was supposed that the construction of blocks will have to be borrowed by the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and followed by this cooling in the relations of the two countries, Kiev began to swallow relations with Moscow in the atomic industry, announcing the refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant and on the project of construction in Ukraine of a nuclear fuel plant.
The only sphere where the relations remained remaining the purchases in the Russian Federation of fuel for the current Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the production of electricity in the country), since the Ukrainian NAEC "Energoatom" will replace the Russian supplies with nothing.
The plans for the construction of the Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been ultimately rejected: in 2014 in Kiev were announced negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.
UN Secretary-General against the use of military force in the resolution of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that the situation in Syria cannot be resolved by military means.
“There is no military solution,” the AP quotes his answer to the question regarding the military support of Syria by Russia.
Ban Ki-moon also said he will hold a meeting with foreign ministers of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the Foreign Ministry leaders of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
“The meeting will be in Syria,” he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Head of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of the creation in the future of a base of the Air Force in Syria.
So far there are no such plans.
“But anything can be,” said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
The U.S. has not trusted the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, who said military assistance to the official Damascus is necessary to fight the prohibited terrorist group Islamic State in Russia.
More details about the U.S. doubts regarding Russian aid to Syria read in the "Ъ" material "Russian military presence in Syria concerns Washington."
The OSCE has announced a possible meeting of Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of the OSCE, Artur Gerasimov, said the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian colleagues-parliamentaries to discuss the situation in the southeastern part of Ukraine.
"What I know: a certain meeting is planned this year, between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," Mr. Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and "to return to normal life activities of our countries."
At the question of whether it is possible, in his opinion, currently dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in the "Normand format" or in the format of the contact group on the OSCE PA site - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was conducted, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the policy, in Kiev supports any kind of dialogue.
Earlier the representative of Ukraine in the talks, former President of the country Leonid Kuchma told that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics fundamentally have not changed their positions on the three-party talks, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
Parties are given mandates.
Yesterday, the electoral commission of Nizhny Novgorod submitted the results of the elections to the city douma by the municipal district, distributing 12 parliamentary mandates played by party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of violations in the course of the elections sounded from representatives of the KPRF, accusing the selection of “covering falsifications.”
Notes of the opposition were not accepted.
Together with the selection, the party "Communists of Russia" refused to organize a referendum on the cancellation of the fee for the repair of multiple houses.
The city selection has officially presented the results of the elections in the pride of Nizhny Novgorod by the municipal electoral district.
A total of 1,03 million people were included in the lists of voters in Nizhny Novgorod, 746,7 thousand voters were issued for voting in the district committees, and 268 thousand voters voted in the elections.
More than 11,7 thousand newsletters were declared invalid and 24 lost.
12 mandates were distributed among political parties depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of the "United Russia" six deputy seats in pride belong to Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasterayev and Igor Nagorno.
The only mandate of the LDPR was the party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The two mandates of the KPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and the Deputy of the State Duma Alexander Tarnayev.
Three "Justice Russia" mandates will be delivered to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must determine whether they will work as MPs in the City Duma: in case of refusal of the mandate, he passes to the next candidate on the list.
The chairman of the border committee Alexander Makayev told the members of the commission that he is introducing the duty for "sending telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" on the subject of refusal of mandates.
At the approval of the protocol on the results of the elections, the representatives of the KPRF declared multiple violations.
The member of the forest council with the right of advisory vote from the KPRF Leonid Krasnoqutsky proposed not to recognize the results of the vote in four districts No. 21-24, reminding that on the order of the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district was closed the entrance to the building of the administration, where four district committees were located.
For a long time, neither the Deputies of the State Court, neither the candidates themselves, neither the observers could pass inside, and the resonant scandal with the attack on the doors of the district administration was shown in the television.
At the meetings of the district committees all observers and members of the committees with the right of consultative vote had the opportunity to attend.
The head stopped access to them only when the vote ended and the district committees have not yet come to submit their newsletters.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
“Then the head was corrected, and at all meetings the interested persons could be present,” said the member of the burning committee, Natalia Andrušina.
Communists objected that in the blocked building of the administration for more than four hours illegally held the council member Ludmila Aristov, about which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also angry that in a number of UICs on the day of the election began to stamp the urns at 6-7 a.m., placing in them bulletins for early voting.
At the same time, the members of the committees with the right of consultative vote and the observers were not notified, so they came to the start of the elections at 8 a.m.
Communists are convinced that in the morning hours before the opening of the electoral spaces in the urns could uncontrollably throw the bulletins.
However, the company, which has already examined more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander Makayev, has not found any violations with the deposits of unrecognized bulletins.
Members of the commission did not support the proposal of their colleague from "Justice Russia" Maria Popova through the bill to get out with amendments to regional legislation to clearly establish the time of opening of the curves with early voting bulletins, which then fall into the urn.
“In order of your own initiative, address at least to the CIC,” Pope Alexander Makayev advised.
At the end of the meeting on the chairman with loud accusations, a member of the KPRF, Sergey Samochin, was overwhelmed, who cried that he ignored dozens of complaints and covered the election falsification.
“You’re not here at the meeting, be more cautious,” the chairman of the election committee insulted.
The protocol was approved almost unanimously.
By September 27 the selection must approve the general results of the elections, after which within three weeks the first meeting of the city douma of Nizhny Novgorod of the sixth session will be appointed.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city election commission refused the political party "Communists of Russia" to register an initiative group for the local referendum.
Judging according to the documents, the parties intended to raise to the discussion of the lower towns two questions: whether they agree that the fees for the repair of multi-appartement houses should be "immediately cancelled" and the tariffs for housing and communal services "frosted until 2020".
However, Duma’s lawyer Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of “Communists of Russia” is contrary to the legislation.
FedEx’s revenue is mixed, lowering forecast for 2016.
FedEx unpleasant results in the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced its annual profit forecast due to a drop in demand for cargo services and an increase in costs in its land transport division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares dropped about 2.5 percent on preliminary shares 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year that ends in May, which is 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts estimated $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
Reduction is observed despite an average rise of 4.9 percent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and an increase in charges for land transport of heavy or volume goods, which starts in November.
The company said it is still planning to increase the revenue compared to the previous year thanks to decreased expenditure, increased gross income and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company “worked stable with the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade.”
Employment plans for the holidays were announced the next day after the competitor UPS announced that they are planning to hire an additional 95,000 employees, approximately as much as they were employed last year.
For the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than a year earlier.
The income per share was $2.42, close to the forecast of $2.44 per share, conducted by Zacks Investment Research survey by 12 analysts.
The income increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in the urgent international transport sector, which has led to a lack of growth in gross revenues in its express transport division.
However, the boom of online purchases has dramatically improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter the revenue from land transport increased by 29%, but operating revenue remained unchanged as a result of increased expenses for large ships and self-assurance.
The express transport unit received higher revenue due to higher basic rates, while in the cargo sector the revenue fell due to increased labour pay costs.
At the preliminary exchanges about an hour before the opening of the exchange, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent - to $150.15.
They closed on Tuesday, falling 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the record from June 11.
At the most anticipated meeting in a few years, the Federal Reserve leaders will spend two days this week behind a 27-foot table of Honduras Red Tree, determining whether it is not time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end of a richly decorated meeting room with a height of two floors above them will be covered by a wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues must put the country’s economic interests above all others.
The Central Bank has received a double order from Congress: to maximise employment in the United States and maintain stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have admitted that there is a third, unwritten assignment: financial stability.
And this third order may be an unknown factor in the almost forecasted decision, which will be announced on Thursday, whether the U.S. economy is ready to withdraw from the unprecedented incentive provided by almost zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.
Even though the majority of the data show a confident growth of the economy, the recent shocks on the world financial markets can keep the already cautious leaders of the Federal system from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds - even only by a quarter of the percentage point.
“It’s clear that the labour market and inflation will become the first and most important subject of consideration,” said Lindsey M. Pegza, chief economist of the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the world market would be enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve system, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
Approximately half of economists, recently surveyed by Bloomberg, predicted a rise in the interest rate this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal system to keep up with this, while the key indicator shows only about 30 percent probability of a rapid rise.
This can lead to a decline in the stock market if the federal system raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions do not mitigate the hit by promising that the next increase will be short.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The rise was provoked by expectations that the persons who define the Federal system’s strategy will leave the stake this week, said John Lonsky, the head of Moody’s Capital Markets Research.
“It will be a surprise if the Federal system raises the rates at this time,” he noted.
If the management of the Federal Reserve will do so, “they will have to go far in supporting their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so that they don’t panic.”
Other experts objected that the rise of the rate could calm the financial markets, as it would eliminate uncertainty about how the federal system will operate.
Just a month ago, the federal system appeared to have tended to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making the first small step in the slow aggravation of the financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she is expecting a rate increase this year, despite the complaints by the liberals that greater economic progress is needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs in August slowed, the growth of the labour market was stable this year.
Unemployment decreased to 5.1% last month, which is the lowest in more than seven years, and almost at the level that in the Federal system is considered full employment.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank’s proposed annual index of 2%, the Federal system’s leadership said the key cause was the temporary effect of the sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy "can deal with higher rates and needs them, taking into account the crashes in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the world’s financial markets dropped at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones average share index for industrial companies fell 16% relative to record high in May, as investors feared that the slowdown of the Chinese economy could hinder global growth.
The market partially recovered its positions this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve system, the turmoil of the market further complicates the difficult calculations of the duration of the interest rate increase.
“Without information about what has happened on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would begin to swallow the hike at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former employee of the Federal Reserve System.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
“There is a great uncertainty about the consequences for the U.S. economy, and they have almost no reliable data after the recent events in China,” Oliver said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Federal system, and technically it should not be taken into account when making these decisions.
The Federal Reserve System has become a global financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been huge.
Only one suggestion from the then president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve system could “shut down” its monetary expansion has caused the shocks of the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly interconnected, it could be expected that the Federal Reserve leaders will not only monitor the developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other Central Banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zakari Karabell, CEO of Envestnet Inc, a global state management company.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve system there have been cases of excessive reaction to the movements of the financial market that appear not to be related to economic principles.”
Laker, a member with the right of vote of the influential Federal Committee on the Open Market, who insisted on the rise of the rate, as an example brought decisions of 1998-99 years.
The financial crisis in Asia led to the fact that the Federal system had lowered its base rate by 0.75% for three meetings, “in spite of the limited identifiable consequences for growth in the U.S.”
A year later, the leaders of the federal system canceled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve should be placed on the first place for stability only in times of major crises, such as the 2008 market collapse,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the interest rate committee at Bank of England.
The last panic and was not close to that level, he said.
“You’t want to be in a situation where you are scared of the rise of rates because the markets are experiencing shock,” said Posen, president of the Institute of World Economy named Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don’t think it should go ahead of the events.

State Duma spokesman Sergey Naryshkin assumes that the U.S. will deliberately destabilize the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees will flow to Europe.
According to Interfax, this opinion he expressed to journalists in Ulan-Bator in the framework of the Autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I’m not a supporter of conspiratory theories, but the question arises by itself: is it not Europe the final goal of those who have destabilized the situation in the northern African and Middle East countries with such a manipulative persistence in recent years?” he asked.
“There’s probably someone who has supposed and knew that the streams of refugees, those unhappy and disadvantaged people who are saved from death, will go to the well-being EU countries,” he added.
Naryshkin asked, “Is many European political leaders openly spoke about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that is now literally shaking their countries?”
“No, old Europe, with a rare exception, prefers to remain silent,” he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO breaks many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe, unfortunately, has long and unfairly looked at and looked at how the military socket, shaped according to NATO standards, dismantles the moral ideals and the basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,” he said.
The government troops and their loyal militarized formations are opposed by rebels consisting mainly of Islamists.
Later, the prohibited terrorist group "The Islamic State" joined the opponents of the Syrian government.
The U.S. is supporting the rebels who oppose both Assad and ISIS.
Damascus officials regard such rebels as terrorists.
The Syrian president called the cause of the West’s dishonesty to Russia.
The claims of the West to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries he would like to remove one person and place another in his place, who will act in the interests of the Western countries, not in the interests of his Fatherland.
Assad has pointed attention to the sharp breakdown of the Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
For them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in a democratic way, despite being elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West."
Putin urged the world community to unite forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the constant statements of the West that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves - then on the request of the people, not on the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communications.
“If the people want him to stay, the president remains, and otherwise he should leave immediately,” he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded that cooperation is being carried out with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism in conjunction with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking of military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that the country supports the Syrian state in politics, economics and military sphere.
He denied the claims that Iranian military units are being sent to Syria.
Tehran supplies us military equipment.
“Naturally, there is a military exchange between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out,” he said.
As for the other countries, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
“We don’t see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Islamic coalition led by the United States,” Assad said.
The number of deaths exceeded 230 thousand people, the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was occupied by the Islamic State terrorist group, prohibited in Russia.
The international coalition led by the U.S. is attacking ISIS’s positions from the air.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
This was by Reuters with reference to State Department spokesman John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
At the same time, Kirby did not present any additional details.
He said the U.S. has tools for "the further isolation of Russia" if it will support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
As the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov during the talks with Kerry again emphasized the need to create a single front to fight terrorist groups operating on the territory of the country.
It also discussed ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
There are also some bilateral issues.
Earlier, U.S. officials said that Russia is increasing its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern over Moscow’s increased support for Assad.
Washington said if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, Russian President's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the country will not fall into international isolation.
The rebels advocate the overthrow of the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was occupied by the Islamic State terrorist organization.
The international coalition led by the U.S. is subjecting ISIS positions to air strikes.
Borodai called the information of the U.S. newspaper a scam on Strelkov.
The former chairman of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic Alexander Borodai denied the information that was published in the U.S. newspaper The Washington Post.
This he said in a telephone interview with the correspondent "Lenty.ru".
The note in the Washington Post is beautiful by the fact that it is all overwhelmed.
Former Defense Minister of the DPR Igor Strelkov, of course, no one connected and "goed out" he from the territory of the republics of the Donbass in a very elevated mood, without chains, without three pounds of money, which are attributed to him by different characters," he said.
According to Borodya, the talk about Strelkov in the conversation with a reporter of the American newspaper really went.
“Yes, I said that Strelkov was urgently required to remove from the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic,” the former head of the DPR said.
Borodai stressed that he was unknown why the correspondent of the American newspaper decided to write about the fact that Strelkov was brought to the territory of Russia "linked".
I suspect it is a provocation.
If it’s not a provocation, then it’s surprisingly misunderstood words, as I emphasized that Strelkov left alone,” Borodai noted.
“It’s a blasphemy both to me and to Strelkov,” he concluded.
Earlier on the pages of the Washington Post appeared an article in which the words of Borodya were stated that he exported Strelkov to the territory of Russia in a compulsory order.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to connect his fellow.
The Polish authorities began searching for a train with the Nazi gold.
Polish forests have begun to cut trees over the underground tunnel, where, according to some data, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
The work began on Tuesday, September 15, according to Reuters.
According to military experts, cleaning the forest is necessary to verify the reliability of rumors about the railway composition with treasures.
Inside the train can be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Nizhny Silesian military department, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence of the existence of a gold train was no more convincing than the previous.
However, the authorities decided to settle the search area.
Three days before this, Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Peter Zhukovsky, said that local treasury searchers with a "99% probability" found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich, which is stated in the legends.
Zhukovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and precious things will be discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the legal firm appealed to the authorities of the Polish city of Waltzhi with a message that they found a train in a murdered tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The main drug doctor of the Russian Federation has proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
Russia's main drug doctor has proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until 21 years of age.
Eugene Brune noted that until this age "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - works especially harmful."
He said in a direct broadcast of the radio station "Talk Moscow", commenting on the information that the spokesman of the Soviet Federation, Valentina Matvienko, supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
People grow unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a person is physically ready to do so.
He is mentally ready for a full life in society since the age of 21.
“It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, is finally mature only at the age of 21,” Brune said.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project "Treating Russia" Sultan Hamzaev told Izvestia that Matvienko supported the initiative to raise the age rate for the sale of alcohol and "accepted jointly with the Public Chamber to raise this question again on the site of the upper Chamber of Parliament."
According to the activist, a working group will soon be created in the Federation Council for the draft law under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible is asked to verify compliance with the law on child information protection
The resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor's office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law "On protection of children from information harmful to their health and development", with a statement on September 16 the correspondent Sib.fm met.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he acquired the Bible, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society at the Red Prospect in the "Cite City" store.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his opinion, violate the FZ "On protecting children from information that damages their health and development."
On the 16th of September, the statement was accepted for examination by the Prosecutor's Office of the city of Novosibirsk.
Answer to the address of the resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
It is far from prohibiting the book.
Much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - commented the applicant to the correspondent Sib.fm.
Moreover, this is a fairly reasonable problem that will disrupt society.
He will begin to read the Bible, which he has not done before.
Brazil Union of Pediatrists Rio Grande promotes healthy nutrition for breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has invented a scandalous method to convince women about the need for full nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves demonstrating images of babies swallowing the chest, drawn up with images of harmful food.
The composition of breast milk includes various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children get all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy needs, pregnant and pregnant women are recommended to increase their daily calorie rate by about 500 calories per day.
However, recent studies show that one increase in calorie is not the only change in the diet that mothers should do.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy nutrition of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents the development of tumors in them.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child’s immune system has been detected.
Under Hamburg, a train struck a school bus.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed in a school bus that stopped on the railway.
A 23-year-old woman driver, realizing that she can’t move from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had a collision in their eyes.
It was filmed by one of the students on the video.
As a result of the emergency, there was a panic among the students.
Some children began to cry and run along the edge.
The route remains blocked.
According to the police, no one was injured by the miracle except one passenger of the train, who was slightly injured.
The damage from the accident was estimated at €300,000.
Doctors call for banning boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of the local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injury in a match with the Philippine Carlo Magali.
The battle for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with the victory of Magali with a nocout in the 12th round.
Brown was hospitalized with a brain injury.
His condition was considered critical, and he was connected to the life-saving apparatus.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended with a win.
He had two children left.
This is the second fatal outcome among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student, Bradon Smith, died from injuries on the ring.
Now AMA recommends not to engage in this kind of sport, and it is better, from its point of view, to ban it at all.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally,” said Steven Pernis, vice president of the organization.
But in the form in which the box is now, there will always be such situations when an athlete gets a bleeding or brain injury, which leads either to death or to severe injury.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that unites practitioners and medical students.
Sergey Naryshkin called on the OSCE to abolish the sanctions against the Russian parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, Sergey Naryshkin, called it unacceptable to impose sanctions on parliamentarians.
He said this in his speech at the OSCE PA session in Ulan-Bator.
We regard this as unacceptable actions, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shame and ignorance of the principles of open international dialogue," the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on OSCE members to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let us return morality to politics.
Let us return dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let us return humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
“The duality never ended with anything good,” he said.
Speaking from the tribune of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to call for an interparliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I urge the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific tasks in security.
“First, on the solution of the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convocation of our interparliamentary group,” Naryshkin said.
He also pointed out that it is necessary to give the right to the OSCE.
“This is almost the only common place where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine,” the politician said.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulan-Bator and will last until September 18.
I the victory for a couple of days.
World champion of light athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergey SHUBENKOVA.
He managed on his coronary distance of 110 meters with barriers to win the European team championship, set several records, and the most important thing - to become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, recently the athlete won the final stage of the Diamond League, taking the third place in the overall ranking.
"New News" asked Shubenkov to share the impressions of the coming season.
Sergey, is the season not over for you yet?
Yes, I’m going to talk to the World War Games, which will be held in October in Korea, and then I’m going to think about a break.
True, I’m going to be preparing at home now, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a different state.
It is easier than every week to travel around the world.
You have somehow said that autumn is your favorite time of the year.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a great time.
Passions after the main start of the season disappeared, the burden of responsibility will no longer be pressed.
You can compete in pleasure, on relaxation.
And you know that vacation is very soon.
Is it tired?
The season is special, a lot of positive emotions.
The fatigue at the end of the season is always accumulating.
It doesn’t matter what you’ve done more, whether you’ve won or lost.
Every competition is stress.
Permanent flights, transfers - all of this does not pass for the body without a trace.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But the emotions, of course, are on the rise.
Yes, I’m just happy!
When you finished the World Cup in Beijing, you’re coming back often?
There is.
You, journalists, don’t let me forget this.
But in general, I think that bad is the athlete who lives with old victories, turning his successful races again and again.
I enjoy the victory for a couple or three days - and we have to move forward.
The preparation for this wonderful season was very different from the usual?
I can’t say that there was something special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He worried first at home in Barnaul, then at the collections, then again at home.
Everything as usual.
But with the coach they put a task: to try to get to a new level that I have not yet been.
Almost all of the winter time spent on building a base.
We fled a lot of crosses, performed general physical training exercises, which included both the drag, and the seat, and the back we climbed.
Then they took the barrier training, they did a lot of technique.
How do the competitors follow?
I’m always trying to do that, good in the internet age with it there is no problem.
I watched the winter championship of Europe, and there in the barrier sprint the whole pedestal was occupied by the French!
I also thought: I have to do something to dissolve this company.
With every start this season you have added and added results.
Does that give confidence?
I have all the last seasons in approximately the same scheme.
There is no such thing that I run first 13.20, and then 13.50.
I always develop my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was to escape 13 seconds.
The whole work was aimed primarily on this result.
But the paradox is that you feel like you’re ready to play, and in competitions to show your willingness doesn’t always happen.
How was it at the Olympics in London?
I, if honestly, that semi-final race (Shubenkov couldn't get out to the final. - "NO") tried to forget immediately.
The preparation was very good, he really could escape from 13 seconds.
Yes, even if he repeated his best outcome at that moment, he would become the bronze prize of the Games.
But not lucky.
Remember your first world championship?
And how?
It was in Togo.
I really wanted to go to the final, there was such a program-maximum.
And he dropped straight from the morning, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that breaking and carrying a broken head means not to go anywhere at all.
Two years later, the World Cup in Moscow has already come to the final with the best time.
I remember my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the gold!
How is it possible, developing a decent speed, not to lose the head, not to turn off?
This is the most difficult.
You need to be very careful, focusing on the technique, so that you don’t break the barriers.
I noticed that when you’re adjusting not to the result, but to the process, it’s much easier.
And the most crazy when you feel like you’re running and it’s like it’s done by itself!
A sincere word, it is worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depth after their first serious successes are trying to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever had such thoughts?
Home is better.
I don’t know where I am without my coach, who I need?
Maybe it would be good to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
Q. Have you been together for a long time?
He was 12 years old since he came into light athletics.
More precisely, I was first trained with his wife, who worked with children, and then she gave me.
I started with the sprint, then jumped in length, triple.
Children's multiplayer was when they throw the ball, jump in the length from the place.
At 14 I tried to run with barriers, and I liked it.
From the first race it was possible to comply with the norms of the second adult division.
So it remained.
Has there never been fear of barriers?
I immediately got to agree with them.
But there was always a lot to work on technology.
How much has he suffered!
This routine does not happen anywhere.
The technician must be constantly shut down - so that I can wake up at night, I would immediately get up and run through the barriers.
Everyone who has seen your race in Beijing claims that it was a very beautiful race.
thank you.
I liked myself.
Usually I didn’t review my races, and I couldn’t stand here.
But on efficiency we need to work further - there are no boundaries to perfection.
Don’t be afraid now that the victory a year before the Olympics will lie on your shoulders with a heavy burden?
As they say in such cases, I will try to justify expectations.
Once you have chosen this path, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you are not weak, no additional burden should be felt.
And I totally agree with him.
by Otar Kusanashvili
Well, I’m not so naive to be surprised by the response to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are crazy, I understand, their bread does not feed - give, throw the enemy.
And even though I didn’t blame with the flag, and the same, just the same, a million times speaking here, and not directly calling anyone a blind, I was a different thing to do.
All my pseudo-friends went down, in a second they went out somewhere.
The pressing that I am exposed to is so strong that even I, who saw the kinds of pineapple, think that white people have been overwhelmed.
If he was walking, he was walking, and a crowd attacked you, and you were muting with the frogs.
But you have to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a bull, I'm hit from a gaubica, old I'm, guys, fear.
The other thing is no support.
I didn’t have any illusions, but now...
The best thing in me has always been self-sufficiency, so eat it.
And giving passports to such curds as Fred Derst or Monson can only be fools.
It would be better for me, the best journalist, to do this.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kusanashvili in a sharp form characterized the Crimean events:
What they did with the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
This is what is called an annexation.
I thus believe that the reference to how the drunk Khrushchev tried to sign something is not in any way fit into the general picture of the human residence.
This is how to get to the neighbor and take his residence.
The war from the Kremlin has gone, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100% confident that, as in the summer of 2008, it began with the call of some crazy from the Kremlin wall.
I have a guess who it could be...
Cobbs have not so much to live.
I don’t understand, he’s the greatest artist, why he needs to wrap Putin’s hands.
Will he lose the apartment?
He was removed a monument.
Of course, people remembered him as insulting his small homeland.
And the reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seventh leads in the ranking despite the attempts of the Ninth to illuminate the losses of the leaders in Today Show
The departure of Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to illuminate the consequences of the Liberal Party's statement on the release of the leader's place failed to strongly raise the rating of Today.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the state's capital after the defeat of Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
The competitor - Sunrise - with leading David Koch and Samantha Armitage, stopped in London as part of a weekly international broadcast series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This distance torture appears to have not been of great importance for Australian TV viewers, with Sunrise’s audience having 397 000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to Today’s audience at 339 000.
Today was slightly higher compared to its ranking on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was slightly worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the gap with Sunrise in the last months.
Today had 318,000 in August, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year the gap varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers against 314,000 on Today.
It was the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change influence more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Karl and Lisa are okay, thank you for the clarification!
Posted on Monday, 14 September 2015
An important news for the Seventh was the stunning 800 Words debut with the former star of the series Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
The new drama about a family father who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children has gathered an impressive audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics discussed whether Thomson could deal with the popular show alone, without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibbini.
The result of yesterday’s evening was a loud “yes” answer.
The X Factor Seventh remained in strong positions with the audience of 1,136 million viewers, easily overcome The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the Seventh, success and failure mixed in the second evening of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new TV, led by Andrew O'Keefi, gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the figure jumped to 623 000 viewers – enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddy McGuire (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators, and the second half-hour - overwhelming 720,000.
The Hot Seat has collected 620,000.
The fall of Chase Australian ratings on the second evening will make the Ninth silently acknowledge that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is the replacement of the Million Dollar Minute, which was unable to overplay the show of McGuire.

The three finalists are unanimous in the fact that the "Cold" Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellow, Sarah McKay and Snowman Marcosky may have accidentally made it clear who of them will win in the Cold.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually stay in the "Cold" is surrounded by a secret curtain.
And the three girls who reached the final, of course, keep silence about who of them got his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snow Marcosky and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls will have to stay, they may undoubtedly give a clue about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps silence until the final will take place on Thursday.
All three women come into a lyric mood, telling why Wood is an ideal man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family values, life joy as the reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
However, with their answers to the question "If not you, who should the last rose of Woods be?" they could undoubtedly suggest who of them actually conquered the heart of the "Cold".
Jevons-Fellowes and Marcosky have undoubtedly called McKay the ideal pair for Wood.
Sarah and Sam have established a good relationship since the first day.
“Since I joined the show, I felt Sarah’s energy and Sam’s energy, and I realized they were very fit to each other, and I had no doubt about it throughout the show,” said Jevons-Fellows.
“Sara is a very open person, easy and fun with her,” Markoski added.
I saw them together, there is really a attraction between them.
They feel good and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay believes she and Sam Wood will be a great couple.
McKay said that thanks to her home dating last week she realized that Woods might be "this same man."
"When I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it was not just a game, I trusted him with all my heart," she tells me.
Asked who to choose Woods, if it was not her, she answered mysteriously.
“I don’t know if I can talk about it,” she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snowman and Lana are equally worthy of it.
The Bachelor show will be released on Wednesday at 19.30 on Channel Ten.

Detroit and Seattle were very interested after his move to the United States - just as many other clubs sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it seemed to be a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Hayne on the reserves for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball that the former player of the Australian Rugby League allowed at the first return of the pants in the win match with Minnesota with a 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayna another chance to return the pants, and also involved him in the game after the wound of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula showed himself in the good side and after the game, in the dressing room.
Instead of arranging the discourse to the beginners in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayna at a press conference after the match.
The 49ers Special Reporter, Cam Inman, said that Hein also received support from the Special Team Coordinator, Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarid Hayne lost the ball on the return of the pant by the Minnesota Vikings team during the first quarter.
At this beginning of the debut in the NHL, Hayne and his numerous Australian fans obviously did not count.
It was seen how Hein was angry leaving the field after losing the ball, and later he told the chief show "Hemish and Andy" at the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, that he couldn't imagine a more unsuccessful start for his career in the NFL.
“That’s happening, you’re just thinking about the next game and everything,” Hein said.
Hein compared his failure to his debut in the Origin game series in 2007, when throwing the ball in his record zone brought the attempt to Queensland.
In the end, this experience was very helpful for a 27-year-old player.
Hein photographed with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a picture on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of use of weapons at the Siberian airport.
Hodorkovsky, who openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were interrupted.
On the Hungarian border there were strikes between migrants and police.
Refugees organized protests on the border of Serbia near the Hungarian settlement of Rescue, which grew into clashes with law enforcement officials.
As a result, the Hungarian police used waterproofs and tear gas, Reuters reports.
Migrants are throwing the police stones and trying to remove the plot on the border.
Police are taking measures in response to aggressive actions by migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to the Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border by buses toward Belgrade and the border with Croatia.
The authorities of the country allowed migrants to arrive in the Croatian territory and ensure their transportation from there to the desired country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian parliament strengthened the legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, the criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, and the accelerated procedure for the examination of asylum requests.
The Hungarian court has already declared one migrant guilty of illegal crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, in connection with which he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
Also, the Hungarian parliament will soon consider the issue of the transfer to the armed forces of Hungary of border protection functions to the Hungarian parliament.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began the construction of a 175 km-long curve ceiling on the border with Serbia to stop the flow of migrants and refugees to the country.
The Russians have committed the biggest cyber attack in the history of the United States.
The Russian accused of the biggest cyber attack in the history of the United States, Vladimir Drinkman, has admitted to theft of more than 160 million credit card numbers.
During the trial at the federal court in New Jersey, Drinkman admitted to a conspiracy with the aim of obtaining unauthorized access to computer systems and with the aim of committing fraud.
During the meeting, the Russians talked about a conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a citizen of Ukraine, accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
“These defendants like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to break down our computer networks, are a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security,” said US prosecutor Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is threatened to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
When the sentence is sentenced, the court will take into account the recognition of the Russians and may reduce the deadline.
The judgment of Drinkman will be announced on 15 January.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect Dmitry Smilian was taken in custody.
The latter denies his guilt for the crimes he has committed.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk of support by Russia of Bashar al-Assad.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will worsen the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia’s support of President Assad risks to aggravate and expand the conflict, as well as to undermine our common goal of fighting extremism, unless we focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power,” the statement said.
Kerry confirmed the U.S. commitment to fighting the Islamic State (which is prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad will never be a reliable member of the coalition.
In a telephone conversation, Kerry also emphasized that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved by a political transition from Assad.
The White House threatened Russia with isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
White House spokesman Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if he did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join the international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media often reports about the presence of Russian soldiers on the territory of Syria.
The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergey Lavrov, said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping the Syrians acquire the equipment to use it against Islamists.
Four killed when police opened a gunshot on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in the south of Nepal when police began shooting with gums to a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution of the country, a official spokesman said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandei, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country’s capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakar, the head of the district police, said that more than 1,000 protesters gathered at one of the police departments, some throwed stones and burning bombs.
Mr. Dakar that the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before leaving the gas balls into operation.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is unclear why gums, which are known to be killed, but are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative, have caused such a high mortality.
This collision was the last in a few weeks of violent protests in the southern, flat part of Nepal, where representatives of the Madesh people say that the new provinces formed by the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
The protests also took place in the west of Nepal, among the people of the Taru nation who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
August, when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, which became a decisive step on the way to a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centralized for centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislatives voted for the article of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new head will be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as a center of the chemical industry, has developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk led the new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
About the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects he told the correspondent "Area".
Oleg Valeryevich, how did you start working as a mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of financial and economic inspections, initiated an independent audit examination of the spending of the local budget.
A review of the municipal property was subsequently conducted.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the document circulation to five days.
Earlier the papers by instances could walk for months.
It has been developed measures to increase the income base and optimize costs.
In November last year in Sayansk took place an exit meeting of the government, where issues of socio-economic development of the territory were discussed.
There was no project and accounting documentation (PSD) for any object in the city.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in the federal programs.
We started with the preparation of the PSD for the roads, the kindergarten, the northern canalization collector and the waterway.
The road work on the two areas is already underway.
How is the President of the Russian Federation's decree on the construction of children's gardens?
In July this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such a positive demography in the city has not been observed in the last 27 years.
So the issue of secure places in children's gardens is one of the most relevant for today.
From 1 September closed for the capital repair of children's seats No. 10, calculated for 320 seats.
The cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such money.
Last year after the repair opened the children's garden No. 23, which is now visited by 200 children.
The repair was done under the conditions of co-financing from regional and local budgets, its value was more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the aid of the regional government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment were sought, and the program "People's Initiatives" helped.
It is planned to start the construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the sequence of children aged between one and a half to three years.
There are no clothes for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city must be engaged, first and foremost, by the Sayan enterprises, they need to be provided with work.
In October, a 60 apartment house for orphan children in the Leningrad micro-region will be put into operation.
As for the construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangaria, which entered the program for the construction of housing of the economy-class.
All necessary documentation is prepared.
The construction of 90 block sections will begin soon.
In total, we said about the construction of 10 thousand square meters of housing Wants to participate in the program very much.
One of the conditions - the housing should not be more expensive than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this cost includes the "sub-key" decoration.
If we deal with the assigned volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At its time on the territory was built the Sayan Swine Complex, which in 2004 was sold for a stone.
We are working with the Prosecutor’s Office to review this deal.
Moreover, the land under the object is in federal property.
Work is going with Moscow, the issue of transfer of 88 hectares to regional property is resolved, with subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest in the reconstruction and launch of the project 1.5 billion rubles.
With the launch of the swine complex we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great support for the city.
Will the Institute of Social Partnership be developed in Sayansk?
We have approximately 140 socio-economic partnership agreements.
Many projects were achieved thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Sensitive support is provided by such enterprises as the OECD "Vostok-Center", Novo-Ziminskaya TEC, OECD "Sayansky Broiler", OECD "PK MDF", the management of these enterprises responds to all appeals.
Directly to the Day of the City, Sayansky Broiler gave the city a children's town, the firm "Vostok-Center" carried out the repair of the horse yard, where specialists deal with the children with hypotherapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to the sponsorship funds, the area of the city of ZAGS was well-established.
The sponsors helped celebrate the Day of the City.
As in old good times, the parade took place with the participation of city collectives and organizations.
It was published a summer of the city, a book of Sayan poets.
Primary builders and people who have made a serious labor contribution to the development of Sayansk have been awarded Jubilee medals.
The Mecenates also participate in the work of the City Charity Fund.
The first step was to acquire instruments for young talented musicians.
Over nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles are intended to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from poor families.
How are the personal problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
There is a lack of doctors and teachers in the city.
For the resolution of the personnel issue, providing specialists with housing is of great importance.
For the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers have received the office housing.
We are working on a housing program with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
The plan is to re-planning the building, in which eight more apartments will be built for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the program "House for the Russian family".
In the future, the construction of houses for workers in the budgetary sector.
The most important thing is that there is a working team in the city with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to make the right conclusions from all the crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma submitted a bill on the indexation of social pensions taking into account the rise of prices.
The State Duma submitted a bill that provides for the indexation of social pensions annually from 1 February, taking into account the rise of prices.
The author of the document - deputy from "Justice Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Rumyancev - also proposes to carry out an additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the rate of growth of the living minimum exceeds the rate of growth of prices for goods and services.
The indexation of social pensions, according to the current legislation, is carried out annually from 1 April, taking into account the rates of growth of the living minimum of the pensioner in the Russian Federation for the past year.
The draft law, submitted to the lower house, provides for the introduction of the indexation of social pensions taking into account the rates of growth of consumer prices.
The first indexation is transferred to the 1st of February, and the second to the 1st of April.
The OSCE head said Mogherini was unacceptable to impose sanctions on parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the EU’s top representative for foreign affairs Federica Mogherini, OSCE spokesman Ilka Kanerva said that sanctions against legislators participating in the assembly events were unacceptable.
This was to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the Autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulan-Bator Nikolai Kovalev.
To support the position of Canerva, signs of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, were collected.
“It has already formed a strong enough support,” Kovalev said.
He previously stated that the head of the OSCE had the intention of gathering the signatures of the MPs, which indicated the unacceptability of sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, Covalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise this problem to the level of the EU’s leadership structures and “to send the corresponding petition.”
NHC reports that the likelihood of cyclone south of the Green Mouse is 60 percent.
The wide front of the low-pressure area approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern edge of the Green Mouse is 60 percent likely to turn into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another clearly defined low-pressure area about in the middle between the Green Mouse Islands and the Little Antilles is also 60 percent likely to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days.
Google to double donations to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced the start of a double donation campaign aimed at collecting $11 million to humanitarian organizations that help captured European countries refugees who flee from war and poverty countries.
Google used an uncharacteristic personal approach to announce a donation collection campaign on its blog.
Instead of the statement by one of the leaders, Google’s employee Rita Masud, who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
“We arrived on doubtful trains and buses, we suffered hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigrant crisis in Europe is increasing, many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
The donations will be transferred to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, the Save the Children and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said it will double the first $5.5 million donations until the amount on the page google.com/refugeerelief reaches $11 million.
Europe is facing the strongest refugee crisis since World War II, mostly caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which caused more than 4 million migrants this year.
Many also flee from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with low obesity can help with obesity surgery
The beneficial effect after obesity surgery in people with low obesity suffering from type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is now too early to claim that diabetics with low obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-chirurgical treatment.
“Statistics of mortality are not revealed immediately,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who wrote about the new study in the JAMA Surgery editor column.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of the organisms to absorb food.
For several years, bariatric surgery has proven its effectiveness in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the main studies were conducted among people with morbid obesity with body mass index (IMT) 35 or higher.
BMI, the measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal at a value from 18.5 to 24.9.
BMI 25 or higher indicates that a person has an overweight and people with BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used the data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - stomach shunting and handgastrectomy, with medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with low obesity.
The average IMT value in those who were subjected to surgery fell from 31 to 24,5 at the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, the IMT in those who received non-chirurgical treatment for diabetes remains at approximately level 29.
Among those who suffered surgery, 36% and 28% were completely healed from diabetes.
In the group receiving medication, for comparison, complete healing from diabetes was observed only at 1%, and partial - only about 2%.
In addition, the indicators of blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “as a whole were better in the surgical group,” the authors say.
The researchers also monitored hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflect blood sugar levels in the dynamic.
Hemoglobin A1c is better to keep below 7%, researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at approximately 8%.
But the best indicators of glycemic control, reflected by the good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not lower the mortality rate in five years, according to research leader Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared to the group who suffered handgastrectomy, the shunting group lost more weight (18.7 kg against 14.2 kg), achieved a greater IMT decrease (on 7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% against 2.1%), and was also closer to the full remission of diabetes (46.9% against 16.7%).
Although the new study does not show the advantages of the surgical method in part of the lifetime after five years, there are confirmations from the results of the study of people with excess body mass in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in the lifetime, according to Blackstone from the College of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for people with obesity who chose a bariatric intervention, the likelihood of dying over 15 years was about 29% lower compared to the group in which more traditional methods were used.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encourages people with BMI below 35, interested in such a procedure.
"The report is very important here, as it claims that such surgery is safe in a group with low BMI, where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient's IMT falls in the range between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to make people take it seriously,” she said.
I think that once they accumulate genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it’s very difficult to turn it back.
In the Customs, the thieves brought out of the house shrubs and 9 million rubles.
In the Customs, the thieves attacked the residents of the sub-Moscow house and stole from them 9 million rubles and three female rubles.
This is by Interfax with reference to the press service of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown through the open entrance door entered the house, located on the street of Gorky, linked the 20-year-old son of the owner of the house and, threatening both by a knife, kidnapped 9 million rubles and three rubles.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case under the article "Robby" was initiated.
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 hotels in St. Petersburg have the right to accommodate tourists who will visit the 2018 World Cup in football.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to get the appropriate permission.
According to experts, this is a very worrying sign.
In front of the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to displace all the guests of the city.
Rosbalt’s talks believe that due to the tournament the rental cost of the picked-up apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship for the picked-up housing will have to be overpaid.
The World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law specially written under the priority, each hotel in St. Petersburg must pass the classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: the hotels are so afraid of checks that they often don’t even send documents on the requests of the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service in St. Petersburg.
According to UFA’s head Vadim Vladimirov, the department has studied 138 hotels and is now planning to initiate 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to the anti-monopoly.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies has deceived citizens by placing a number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov said.
The problem is that now on the account literally every number, no one can be lost before 2018.
Officers suspect that during the football championship the fans will occupy all the Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city tourists can count on 30,5 thousand rooms.
According to Smolny, 17 five-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, 550 one-star hotels.
According to the first deputy committee for tourism development, Nana Guichi, at the moment the classification was passed by only 23 hotels - so many checks were carried out by accredited companies in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny is unknown by a surprising accumulation of circumstances.
That is, passed classification may be more, but no one knows about it.
“The last six years the hotels have not been very struggling to pass the classification,” the director of the North-West department of the Russian Union of tourism industry, Yekaterina Shadskaya, said.
This is due to the high season, during which hotels make the most money and don’t want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets, in which there were no costs for checks, while the procedure can go to the hotel depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
But yet recently the hotel managers have increased and began to submit applications for classification, Shadskaya assured.
The hotels must succeed until July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but will not even get the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed fee for the room in the hotel will be developed at the time of the tournament.
The formulas on which the cost will be calculated will be announced next year.
This is done to prevent the rise of prices by 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to be conscious and not allow an increase in two or three times, but the hotels also need to make money.
“I think growth will be up to 50%,” said President of the Russian Hotel Association, Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that the fixation of prices corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I don’t know how much this is placed within the framework of economic theory, but I hope that measure is justified.
“It’s better than a steady journey,” he said.
It is unclear what will happen with popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the State Duma submitted a bill pursuant to which hostels should be banned in residential houses.
We very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not affect St. Petersburg.
“We will defend the point of view that hostels should be preserved,” says Nana Gvacia.
However, according to her, the owners of minihotels in any case should be ready to strengthen the Housing Code.
If the State Duma still approves the bill, then in St. Petersburg about 80% of hostels will be closed, and at the moment there are 1,5 thousand rooms.
According to the President of the Northwestern Federation of Restauranters and Hotelers Leonid Garbar, there are a lack of two- and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg, which are just demanded by football fans, but there is a cross toward four- and five-star hotels.
This situation is similar to the situation when "75 thousand wipes sit on the 80 thousand stadium."
This can be fixed at the expense of mini-hotels.
The expert considers their possible prohibition as “idiotism”: “I find it strange that some people can live in apartments, but visitors can’t.”
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that it is wrong.
But if it’s a hotel that guests arrive for a short time, why not?
Mini-hostels are at risk of missing the world football championship and because of their impairment.
Hundreds of small hotels simply fail to pass the classification, and the hole grows themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be ordered.
“Companies that can carry out this procedure are not so many, so they will refuse the less paid orders from the mini-hotels, and will choose those that travel,” Gennady Lamshin noted, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of passed checks at the moment significantly higher than the St. Petersburg.
The cause of the Petersburg delay is associated, among other things, with constant interruptions in the tourist block of the government, which does not contribute to the hard work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels are not enough, it is likely that you will have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
According to the example of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg in the city can mobilize the river fleet, that is, the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
Additionally, many fans will be prepared to come in trucks where you will be able to stay.
“The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that they will then be empty,” Gennady Lamshin said.
Also a great popularity during the football championship will be to use the filming housing.
Most likely in the city will be a reserve of picked up apartments.
The rental rates will increase by 10-30%.
"From obvious - the first will go housing near the stadium," said Laris Bragin, a rental specialist at the Agency for Real Estate Development and Research.
And the rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in bedrooms.
This will also contribute to the construction of new transport connections on the outskirts of the city, she emphasized.
We should not forget about the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Harbar is confident that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitality city in which people don’t just suggest the road, but can also take a mini tour.
There are also complications.
My father in the 1970s in the courtyard met a family from Murmansk - his father, mother and two children.
They found no place to sleep: it was difficult at the time with the hotels, it was hard to sleep at the station.
“And dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep,” the speaker recalled.
Indeed, he added that now such a trait in the inhabitants of the city has not remained - calling home to himself is overwhelmed by consequences and scary.
But maybe, in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hotels and governments will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "Sill" of the Amur area.
With admiration today I watched the clown of Zhirinovsky in the State Duma.
He did such things when our generation was just learning to trade in newspapers, and is still in great shape.
The theme of the speech is "the protest of the LDPR against the results of the elections in the Amur region."
Protocols do not bother - for nothing; other protocols, except signed by the selection committees, the LDPR, by all, does not.
Here he raises the second-place Ivan Abramov and screams something like: "This is the winner of the election!"
And right now nothing is placed on the Rodnin, and then, after a breakdown with the chairman, he leads the faction out of the meeting hall, and literally "You are all with the fronts your thieves and thieves."
The press, of course, emphasizes not Abramov, but the scandal and demarch of the faction as a result of this scandal and insult.
Volfovich really beautifully and elegantly folded the Amur area together with Abramov.
For the whole of the country, this is a further Jirinovsky's outbreak in the style of "Podonki!", and not a protest of the political party against the results of concrete elections.
And the faction has formally scandalized, and the elections, if you believe the party’s site and Facebook Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader of the topic obviously falls down.
He gives the dead on Amura to be buried by himself, and he himself blesses against the "United Russia" as a whole and in nothing to be guilty of the Fathers.
A great decision, so that the face does not lose, and in the real, not showing scandal does not go.
The other thing is that now Abrahams themselves are in a strange situation.
In addition to the calls from the chief, he did not expect anything, there were no alternate protocols on his hands.
He - not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for the narrow circle it has become a formal reason and for insulting the respected champion, and, more clearly, ham falls to the address of the ER and the UNF.
And here, of course, he needs to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, the policy number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 to the only regional one-mandate district, it can become a Paris, which has successfully used its own party leadership and a super irritant for the same UNF and the party leadership of the stranger.
It is clear that if there were no Jirinovsky, he should be invented and respectfully observed.
Trump is still growing and growing.
There was a news that the LDPR would return to the hall during the next plenary session.
The bathroom has fallen from nothing.
The subject of Abramov was buried.
Beautiful really.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for the cessation of violence in countries that are the homeland of refugees.
Dalai Lama touched the question of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Center in Oxford, dedicated to ethical research, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the present circumstances the interests of mankind should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this is admirable, the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate.
“It’s impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama highlighted Germany and Austria’s actions in connection with the crisis, he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution.
“The care of thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring true peace and actual development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he said.
Finally, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We need to weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Talking about violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush's actions after the 9/11 terror attacks, saying that the strong US reaction launched a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is possible through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he applied force, and that caused unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children swallowing the hand desinfectant over the past 4 years
Toxicological centers in the United States a 400-percent increase, starting in 2010, in the number of children under the age of 12 who digested the high-alcohol hand desinfectant, according to the Georgian State Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gailard Lopez, director of the Georgian State Toxicology Center, cases of infusion by children under the age of 12 years of hand dezinfection fluids, which were to toxicological centers, increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children get in touch with these substances more often, and unfortunately some percentage of them are sent to the emergency department,” Lopez told CNN.
He told that some children drink disinfecting fluid specifically, and some do it to make an impression on their friends, or on a dispute for social networks.
On YouTube videos you can see how teenagers drink disinfecting fluid as a cheap drink.
The adolescents were to mix the disinfecting fluid with the alcohol-containing fluid to wash their mouth to get a stronger drink.
Younger children can attract pleasant odors of disinfecting fluid.
“The child doesn’t think it can hurt him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (desinfecting fluids for the hands) are those that are aromatized.
There are disinfecting fluids for hands with the smell of butterflies, vineyards, orange, which are very attractive for children.
The desinfecting liquid for hands contains somewhere from 45 to 95 percent of alcohol.
In small children, in particular, only a few sprayes can cause alcohol poisoning.
“This is a high concentration alcohol,” said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, the head of the toxicology center at the Kansas University Hospital.
You’t just leave a rubber of whisky, but people keep these hand disinfectants in mind, and if children get to them, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Naja Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested a hand disinfectant with a clay smell in a quantity of approximately four spray, was sent to the emergency department for treatment.
Her blood alcohol levels were 179, twice as high as in an adult who is legally considered to be alcoholic, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, the emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett medical center near Atlanta.
Naja confused the words and couldn’t walk when she was delivered to the emergency department.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic to not miss any signs of brain injury as the girl fell and hit her head due to alcohol, Ritchie said.
“It was very terrible,” told CNN Orthoria Scott, Naigi’s mother.
This could be fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-smalling substances or disinfecting towels, in addition to removing the disinfecting fluids for the hands from the children’s reach zone.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after ingesting a disinfectant containing a toxic undetected ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was indicated as an active substance.
In January, three four-class students in the north of New York agreed to poison their “resistant” teacher by “dispersing antibacterial substances in the classroom,” according to a police report.
She has a strong allergy to hand disinfectants, and she has banned from keeping them in her classroom.
The police believe that the failed plan was "pull conversations" and addresses discipline issues to the school district.
As the oldest children’s library in Barcelona became a family club.
On the back of the cabin at the entrance to the countryside children's library named N.K. Krupskaya is a choking cottage.
The babies who come for books try to feed her with flavours.
He has been in this library for several generations for 95 years.
The first readers in the twentieth years of the last century organized here loud lectures, put performances according to the verses of Mayakovsky, conducted literary victories and re-written with the wife of Lenin.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalin" wrote in 1939, with every day the "friendship between the Hope of Constantinople and the friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaul" became stronger.
Hope Konstantinovna even sent a child’s photo to a far away Barnaul friends.
And when the Barnaulans asked whether Hope Constantine does not object to the library to give her name, she wrote that no, does not object.
The letter has long been dirty in the museum, and the grandchildren and grandchildren of the first readers have to explain who this hard profile decorates the barrel in the library building.
In the years of reconstruction often called different people, angry: why is the children’s library not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of a good child writer, without political painting!
The staff of the library sat, thought, and decided to leave everything as it was.
"Krupskaya" is the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, as a "leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library vestibule is a road of yellow rubber.
"The Wizard of the Smurry City" is the favorite theme of the artist Olli Moskovka.
Earlier, Olya was a manager in a legal company, came to work at eight, left at five, and from all the other managers she was different only by the love of drawing.
And then she found an advertisement on the internet: "I need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a young American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My Mother has cancer."
Olya made illustrations, and thought: life can end at any time, and there will be no miracles in it unless you create them yourself.
Now she works in a library, illustrates children’s books of writers around the world and writes stories.
It is traditionally believed that children lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space.
But the children who read go to us, and their parents understand the importance of reading, says the director of the library, Tatiana Kushvid.
In recent years, we have even a moment of confidence that a children’s library is needed, and it will live – some boys go here!
I think the interest in reading is back.
In the vestibule of the library hangs a large exhibition vitrage with an updated photo exhibition.
Once a quarter new photos of readers who go to the library with the whole family: mom, dad and children.
In the library, they are glad that the fathers come with the children more and more.
If at two years a child was read all of Chukovsky, then at the older age he needs books more complex.
But now there is a law that prohibits eight-year-old wunderkind to issue books from the 12+ category.
To get such a book, the child must bring with his parents - they come, then return again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes for them something like a family club.
In the library there are treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of bullets with cats and ears, the story of Kronenko in an appendix to the magazine "Niva", the shell of "Mursilki" for 1936.
After all, we are now not just the conceptual space of the "Temple of the Book", we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a work, not a school," Tatiana Kushvid explains.
You can come to us to read, play, draw together.
We made a playground for babies - the child comes just to play, and one hand is still pulling to the book!
Some of our readers parents wear, and they stick with their legs, they don’t want to leave.
Mothers often come with wheels – and we’re glad they put the library in the first place among all the other places to go with the babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says: Modern children like us, love classical children's literature:
“The publishing business is now developing, and a lot of attention is paid to the authors who are the link between generations.”
And when it comes to small children, it is important for them that there is a kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don’t like to break up with their heroes.
The library continuously publishes booklets for parents, in which it tells us what is happening in modern children’s literature, what books are worth paying attention and why.
The booklets are so exciting and interesting that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
Exporting books outside the reading room for adults is prohibited.
This magical privilege is only available to children.
...The most distant room of the library has a square lock with an ancient wooden staircase in the subway, in the bookstore.
The stairs will hide under your steps – it’s already a very old machine of time.
With the book of your childhood you meet as with a old friend: hello, good that we are not changing with you.
Ellie is just as pleasantly walking on the road, stumbled by the yellow rubber, with the tape of Tola Rizikov stole the magical spikes, and Malchis-Kibalchis has never told the forgiven bourgeois of the Military Secret—this is his firm word.
Such books - like passwords, by them you can find yours anywhere.
There are in the warehouse and real book rarities - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of bulbs with boxes and ears.
Or tell Kronenko in the famous app to the magazine "Niva".
Or the "Murzilla" for 1936.
The time shrinked the pages, painted them in tea color.
These publications are no longer published to readers.
This is a slope of our future collection, I all dream - I'm going to retire and take rare children's books.
But the children are not going to do this, so to say, and the paintings in the old books are not very bright, and the themes... you open the first page, and there is Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now it seems, why did we all write this “Pioneer Truth?”
But it was still interesting, - tells the "Russian Planet" Galina Ilasova, the head of the bookstore.
The pages of the "Murzilla" dark from time to time.
Galina Vasilyevna leads the bookstore all his life.
She knows what collars Buratino has, in what school year Harry Potter became the captain of the Griffindor team at the quidditch championship, in what situations Carlson uses the dust for the motorcycle, and who the father of Alice Selezneva works.
The work of a librarian is paid little, and everyone who can live without these book lines finds a different profession very quickly.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, teachers, employees of the cult of the book.
They can also be learned by a smile - it is believed to be a professional feature of a child library designer.
If he smiled to you in the first minute of the conversation, he is a professional.
I love children’s books in general: as a librarian I like them to be, to stand straight and beautifully on the rocks, and I also love to read them, says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fantasy.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
In my childhood, everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of everything that happened to me at that time.
And since I loved them madly, I felt that the library was a magical place.
I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be, despite the reader.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring the children, and the grandchildren.
The rumors: There are no disagreements in Celtic
Griffiths denied the talks about disagreements in Celtic after Dale acknowledged that Hops was in a bad situation, but he will fix it.
The Harts will protest against the claims of the Scottish Football Association to Neilson, and Warbert is afraid to sign contracts in January that could break the unity of the team.
"Don's" increased the advantage over Celtic to five points
The penalty of Adam Runi in the first half gave Aberdeen a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittodry, allowing Donce to deviate from Celtic for five points.
Griffiths denied discussions about disagreements
This caused rumors about the disputes in Celtic, which were interrupted by Griffiths, who said he and his team colleagues are not suffering from any increased criticism while preparing for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don’t think we feel tension, I think players are looking for it.
The Netherlands are boring because the Scots are not fighting for the title.
Former Rangers semi-defense player and former Netherlands team member Ronald de Bour said the Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic because he is not competing for the title with Rangers.
De Bour, currently a representative of Ajax, said: "The Celtica games are no longer showing the most attractive moments in the Netherlands, and why?"
That’s because there’s no Rangers.
People here don’t just talk about the return of Rangers.
They talk about the “Old Company”.
They talk about both teams together, and that’s what they’re interested in.
In the games "Old Firm" a lot of tension, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
“I’m going to change everything,” Dale said.
Ronnie Dale has admitted that Celtic is experiencing difficulties, but the Norwegian coach has sworn to change everything.
After the defeat from Malmö and, as a result, the departure from the Champions League soon followed the defeat of 10 footballers "Aberdina", who now, with a five-point departure, takes the top line of the table.
However, Dale said, “Selitka had bad periods before, and we’ll go out again.”
Now we want to get out of it as quickly as possible.
I understand that it’s very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very evil or annoyed with what’s happening.
We too, but we have to continue.
And we really, really need the support of Celtic because of this players are becoming much better.
Staying together is so important.
Warberton is looking forward to January transfers
Despite the opinions that appeared just a few weeks ago suggesting that he had defined some of the targets of the January transfers, the Rangers boss Mark Warberton is confident about the January campaign, claiming that he does not want to destroy the unity of the team.
Former Brentford attacker said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for players who come in summer, you have a period before the beginning of the season for their adaptation that you have seen in our own group this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more harm is caused by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in Celtic, suggested the end of his career
The Suonsy attacker Mitch, linked to Celtic during the transfer window, suggested that he could leave football after his contract with the Lambs ended.
The 29-year-old player suffered from troubles for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Harts are going to confront SFA over Neilson's statements
“Harts” leads with 2:1, when they removed Paterson, and started losing 3:2, but the defendant’s red card was later cancelled; it’s Colum’s third red card, cancelled in eight months.
Neilson refuses to say, “I have not questioned ethics, I have not commented on the game.”
Griffiths swears to escape Tinkass
Hybernian's striking player was sentenced after acknowledging he had singed a song with insulting words about former Harts player Rudy Scacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roosebern district in Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh derby at the Tykansle in March 2014.
“It was a derby, and it was a burn,” the attacker said, adding, “I can say with certainty that I’t intend to return to Tykasl if he doesn’t play for Celtic.”
Donelli: Tanadis's council is confident in the management of "Dandy United"
Simon Donelli claims that the Board of Directors of Dandy United remains confident that the team of managers will change the situation to the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We’re preparing the guys to go out again,” Donelli said.
McKinness is happy that he won Hamilton’s “wonderful” win.
Derek McKinness acknowledged that his team "Aberdin" had to desperately fight against "Hamilton Assis" to the seventh consecutive victory in the Premier League, putting them five points above "Seltica", above the tournament table, thanks to the penalty of Adam Runi in the first half.
McInnes said, “There is no team here that wins a cup or a league championship that has not won the match in this way.”
The unemployment rate among Scotland is not changing, while in the United Kingdom it is increasing as a whole.
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained at a level of 164,000 people in the period from May to July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1,82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was above the UK level by 5.5%, as indicated by the National Statistical Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland decreased by 12,000 people in three months, while the number of employees is now 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland dropped per quarter to 74,0%, which is above the average of 73.5% in the United Kingdom.
Scottish Minister of Affairs David Mandell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The long-term plan of the government has set the foundation for strengthening the economy."
It has passed almost exactly a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, we have seen further improvement in the labour market of Scotland with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Why I'm a witness of the death in Oklahoma
Today, avoiding legal intervention in the late stage, I’m going to see how a person is executed.
If that happens, and I hope it’s not yet, I’m going to sit on the watch gallery of the murderer’s cameras in the Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip will be executed with a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
For the first time this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As this day approached, I began to be afraid.
So why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique course.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend the executions in America, and as those who wish often more than places, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be elected.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to 5.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotions.
I can’t do that.
I’m going to sit with Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and we had our own relationship with him after a few months of telephone calls and one visit lasting two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I can’t be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I’m not allowed to take a blocknote and a handle to record what I see.
I have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of acting in my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes, get access.
I appealed to her.
She acknowledged that she “will be better to formulate,” but she still believes I’m wrong in what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip did not agree with any of what I said and wrote.
He didn’t tell me what to write, and I’t do that even if he had spoken.
I told him that he could pull me out of his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that voice will help the motion for the abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this matter, listen to the podcasts I’ve recorded.
I will not go here in detail again.
I can’t say with confidence that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treez make him guilty of accompanying the crime.
But I believe there is a great probability that he is not guilty of the murder.
I am firmly convinced that evidence for the death sentence was not enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that point I will see how he will die.
I can’t say I’m totally objective.
There will be other reporters to be contacted for this.
From me you will learn what it is to see how the person I like dies without necessity.
Police persecuted man agreed to get out of the Canning River
A constable from the town of Canning-Wale managed to convince a man to go out of the Canning River and to remain dry.
The resident of Perth intended to escape the police, but failed, stuck in dirty water on a small water, a few meters away from a police officer, trying to “make him softly to get out to the coast.”
Canning-Wayle police were called on Tuesday for illegal penetration in a foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to escape from them, leaving to Canning.
But he didn’t go far.
“He stood in the water and said, ‘I’m not going to go out, let’s catch me,’ said senior sergeant Shandell Kasldane.
Consteblu Laclan Perhavetz didn't really want to urinate the form, so he used a safer reception - "conversations with a good police officer."
“Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape,” said senior Sergeant Casldane.
This is what football champion Ben Casinos remembered.
In 2006, Casinos went to the quevet to avoid meetings with a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to cross the Swan.
His efforts turned out useless, but encouraged the local residents to invent the joke "Bean Kazins biathlon".
Peter Mudi accuses the Steward of trying to spy and threatens to leave the horse sports
Peter Mudi accused the Racing Victoria Stewards of trying to put a spy into his cabin last year and threatened to immediately leave the horse sport.
His goal was to stewards and employees of the ethics department of Racing Victoria, whom he accused of organizing a campaign personally against him, and the withdrawal of Lady Tati due to the violation of the rules of drug use on the start day, on Wednesday, became the last slump.
Modi told Fairfax Media that he always made every effort to participate in the leaks, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came out of the positive result of the Leader's test on the kobalt, which he can't explain.
He kept his tongue on suspicion of spying for a year and a half and he didn’t want it to look like a green grape.
"I didn't intend to say anything about it, and I've suffered a long time, but sometimes it gets you so hard that you don't get back," Modi said.
They know that it continued.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
Today I will go home and sleep strongly.
I want to walk with a high height and I want my owners to know - I do everything I can for them.
When they begin to think that it’s wrong, then I’ll have to stop being a coach.
I have to think about what to do with my license.
Previously, Modi sensationally said during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy in his cabin.
“First and a half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I’ll call if they asked, and offered him a job in my cabin to transmit information about what I’m doing in my cabin,” Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly believe that I am a fraudulent.
If so, they should all submit claims, because they failed to try to catch me.
Robert Rollston, former RVL chairman, David Moody, current RVL chairman, and Bernard Sondry, future RVL executive director, knew this all the time and know it now.
Should this not make me think that the matter becomes personal?
Shouldn’t RVL gain courage and call for responses for what’s happening in this business, other people, except coaches?
Are I ready for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people think that’s so.
Per they’re going to take my license and push me out, and I don’t doubt – what I’m talking now can make them think about it.
But now I’ve reached the point where I don’t care, and that’s sad for me.
I am really sad about it.
I will put pressure on them and put responsibility on them to make decisions.
I have support from my family and I can leave.
The coach's annoyance only grew during the long investigation of the case with the kobalt and the Lidar, and the latest removal of the horse from the start forced him to say that he could "wrap his license on the table."
Mudi, most famous for preparing the unbeatable champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of medicines on the day of the competition "smiling" after the horse's legs were applied a compression of dust, which is a violation of the rules.
It is a violation of the rules of running.
“I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly made a compression on her leg.
She could get a compression yesterday night.
She could get it yesterday as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Mudi may be disqualified for three months in accordance with the rules on the use of medicines on the day of the competition for the use of the compression, for which the stewards have opened an investigation.
This is a joke.
People who make these rules don’t know anything about horses.
“We all understand that we need rules, but it’s gone too far,” Modi said.
The driver who committed the accident and escaped from the place of the accident in Kobram, arrested
Police have arrested a man who shot a motorcyclist in Kobram on the weekend and escaped from the place of the accident.
The motorist was delivered on a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after a car crashed him on Murray Valley Hayway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the wounded motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalya surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
It is assumed that he will be charged with leaving the place of the accident, lack of assistance and other traffic rules.
A motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Kobram, remains in a stable state in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellami Accuses Competitors of Using Strong Violence Treatments
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellami called the criticism of his team’s overtaking of the ball as “the imposition of the agenda” by the two favourites of the NRL championship.
Sydney Routers coach Trent Robinson said the judges allowed the Storm to “fight” with his team during the sudden victory of the Storm in the final of the qualification game in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear mark on the Storm after his team won the final of the qualification tournament at Nozern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening, when he called this game "typical" for the Regby League and stated that two of the Queensland teams were not "too successful" in the handheld battle.
Bellami defended the interception of the ball with his team and said they were simply focused on "contact" by intercepting the ball.
Bellami added that he inserted confidence in the criticism of his team by two leading coaches, as this means they are worried about the possible defeat from the Storm.
“It continues to rise – I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talk about the hardship when they defeated us with 24:2,” Bellami said on Wednesday.
I can tell you that we have not changed anything throughout the year in our systems or defense techniques, just in the last six weeks we have paid special attention to contacts when taking the ball, and this has become a turning point for us.
He has been training there for three years and he clearly trains a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, and for him it became a bit of shock.
It’s funny, as it always appears at this time of the year.
Bellami disputed with Benett's idea of "impressive football," reminding his teacher that St. George-Illowara Dragons won Benett's 2010 championship, showing a "mick" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening, and see how impressive their game was,” Bellami said.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was a lot criticized by calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he didn’t care about it.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers impressive football, especially his young semi-defenseers with their speed.
This is the football you would like to play when you have such players.
He made this note in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two semi-defense players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are slightly disturbing the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn’t think of us when they got to the big games.
Bellami also noted that the Storm and Ruthers were a match with a greater number of points than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The game "Broncos" was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the account? 16-12?
In our game it was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is it an impressive football?
Or consider impressive interruptions and unsuccessful attempts?
This is a routine for me.
If they mention us, that means that at some point we can meet them there.
The Storm is at the end of this weekend, as they have won the right to take either North Queensland Cowboys or Crown Sharks next Saturday evening at the preliminary final at the AAMI Park Stadium, the tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
A Serbian accused of drug storage has been released with a $200,000 deposit.
The man who is threatened to life imprisonment for attempting to acquire 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland by smuggling, was released under a $200,000 deposit.
Marco Maximovich, 29 years old, is one of five people arrested last month after the federal police found 100 pounds of drugs on the Solay yacht, the highest from South America through Vanuatu and landed in Kumer in August.
In the morning, Maximovich and his companions were seen at the port, and later he met with them at Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maximovich is threatened with a lifetime for attempting to add drugs in a quantity sufficient to sell, the lawyer Maximovich claims that there is no evidence that the latter was trying to capture the whole party, and that the man could be in a cafe without any intention.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich was worth releasing.
The latter has a relationship with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he said at the court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lie to the police about his location.
Maximovich's mother and father were asked to make a joint deposit of $200,000 for his release.
“The two testimony makes it clear that the $200,000 bet amount is a too big financial burden for them,” Flanagan said.
But one of these measures is not sufficient as a guarantee that it will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovich was allowed to be released under guarantee, provided that he will give his Australian and Serbian passports, will be registered in the police daily and follow the command time from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Fotiz Kacikaris: “I’m proud of the team of Greece that fought until the last seconds.”
The head coach of the Greek team, Fotiz Kacikaris, gave his duty to his team after the match of the 1/4 final of the Eurobasket-2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game has been resolved by individual errors.
It was a great game, — quotes AFP Kaczynski.
We were preparing for a great game with the Spanish players.
They tried to work in defense, but errors in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It’s sad, but I’m proud of my friends.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: “In CSKA I will be charged with the functions of Caune.”
CSKA newbie Joel Freeland said he did not believe in the forgiveness of the army.
He also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to break the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague in the next season.
I’ve talked with coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, by myself, after I joined the team, — quotes R-Sport Freeland. — In fact, I’ll be charged with the functions of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in the defense buildings and in the attack from the three-second zone, and I think I’ll be able to cope with it.
Yes, I’ll need some time to rebuild to the center position, yet in the NBA I’ve played more forward.
Now it will have to be more to oppose the big central rival, but I’ve already done this before, so I think, and now I’m going to do it.
The army last won the Euroleague in 2008.
Since then, they have reached the four final six times, but there each time they could not show their best basketball.
Someone believes the team has been shaken.
In this whole game, you can’t win forever.
Of course, it’s difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we are going to show the best they are able to do, then we have a good chance to win the Euroleague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the Mosquitians had already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSKA.
When it comes to glimpse, I am not a supernatural person and I do not believe in any forgiveness.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then everything is possible.
I have no specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.

I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I gained some experience. -UEFA official website says the words of Luis Enrique.
I have very warm memories about Rome.
It will be a special game for me, but it’s not so important.
The main thing is to start the Champions League with victory.
The August match at the Coupe of Juan Gamper will not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I'm looking forward to Rome's game she showed in Serie A against Juventus.
It is a strong team that knows how to press and know what to do with the ball.

How we'll play with "Krasnodar", we'll see, - said the official website of "Ural" the words of Skripchenko.
We have a whole week of preparation.
This team has different options of attacking actions, variously conduct its attacks, at the same time and we team is not slow, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In front of this game, taking into account that Krasnodar is holding the European League match against Borussia Dortmund, we will try to be very well prepared to win.
Roger Canyas: “The Astana House can pick up glasses from anyone.”
"Astana" semi-defense Roger Canyas after the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with "Benfica" (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of the game of his team in the future.
According to Havbek, in their field, the Astanians can pick up glasses from any competitor.
Despite the fact that the match was hard for us, I can say that we played well, - said Canyas on the UEFA official website. - We had little courage in the attack.
"Benfica" is above the class, but in the home match, I think we can count on picking out their glasses.
This is quite real.
But first we need to think about Galatasaray, and then about Atletico.
At home, we can pick our glasses from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: “I will repeat as many times: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world.”
Real Madrid's chief coach Rafael Benitez expressed his satisfaction with the big victory in the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group tournament with the Champion (4:0).
The specialist gave the right forward to Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the author of three goals.
The match was difficult because "Shaker" knows how to possess the ball," said Benitez on the UEFA official website.
The opponent had not a lot of moments, but their countertails always hide the danger.
I’m not going to say that Real played perfectly, but we had a lot of possibilities.
I'm happy that we didn't miss the balls and hit four.
Cristiano Ronaldo confirmed his level.
He’s the best player in the world, I’ll repeat it every time.
Jordi Alba: “Christian Ronaldo cannot be compared to Messi.”
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes that no one will be able to compare with his single club Lionel Messi.
According to the Spanish, Real Madrid’s forward Cristiano Ronaldo can’t do that either.
Messi is five goals above the rest, - cites Le Figaro Albu. - What Leo can do, no one can.
Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field everything changes, I can't compare it to anyone.
Daniel De Rossi: "Barcelona" has not only a unique style, but also bright individualities.
Rome's semi-defense Daniel De Rossi, on the eve of the group tournament of the Champions League with Barcelona, noted the importance of compactness and insurance in the game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
Remember, S.E. will conduct its text broadcast.
“Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players,” said UEFA official website De Rossi.
It’s hard to play with blue grenades, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright individualities.
In order to leave them, we will have to swallow throughout the match and insure each other.
Messi is almost always successful when he’s going to the edge, so we need to keep compact and organized.
Ezhov hopes to come out in the start of the SKA in the match with "Slovan".
SKA goalkeeper Ilya Yzhov emphasized that he hopes to come out in the start of the army in the next match of the KHL championship.

The next match will be played against Slovenia.
I hope I’ll go out in the next match in the starting composition, says R-Sports.
I’m not an expert in gateways, I’m a gateway, we don’t show repeats of missed goals, so it’s hard to track.
"Dinamo" played well, everyone had bad matches.
The team has lost anyway.
I would have missed more, but the team won.

Stephen Hogg used the girl’s phone to force pedophiles to send photos
The pedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to ask for images of violence against children.
Stephen Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was asleep, registered on the internet messaging service, where he received a number of dishonest images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found a missing phone and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photos, and immediately turned the attention of her mother.
The police came and saw five images, then investigated the computers found at that address, and found the "compatible" requests in the search system using words to detect unjust images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he did it because it could "attract pedophiles" and then he would "think that he was a police officer to scare them."
Authorized prosecutor Elyde Robertson told the Sheriff's court in Dundee: "He said that it was addiction, he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that he was making requests on the computer, but said that it was because he wanted to become a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures, and that he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to blame them.
He said he had headaches when he was drinking, and said he wanted to see images of rape and murders.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When the girl found the photos on the phone, she called her mother, scratched and cried.
She saw unrighteous images on the phone, and then the accused was made an eye stake.
The girl was questioned and that the accused used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23 years old, from the Ward Road in Dundee, acknowledged himself guilty in the allegations of making unrighteous photos of children on June 14, last year, violating the terms of the war on January 25 of this year and failing to appear in court for hearing on March 24, this year.
The lawyer of the defendant, Gregor Sim, requested not to include Hogg on the list of the persons committed sexual crimes, as it can be proven that there was no "important sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alister Carmaykl has delayed the sentence until October, before receiving reports from the social services.
Hogg was released under custody in the case, but he was taken in custody before he began hearing on other remaining cases.
He was included in the list of persons committed sexual offences before the date of sentence.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe is not reading the speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African state leader, earlier this year fell from the staircase leading from the podium.
He was not injured, but the video with the scene of the fall immediately spread on social networks.
The opening of the parliament was also overwhelmed by statements by parliamentary opponents that they received anonymous threats warning them that Mugabe should be disguised during the speech.
A month ago, they scratched the president during his address to the nation in parliament; this speech Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Innosent Gonez, a member of the Democratic Change Movement, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with warning not to interrupt Mugabe’s speech.
“The message came from a number that isn’t displayed, but it’s titled ‘Death,’ he told reporters at the end of Mugabe’s speech.
It warned the noted members of the parliament that the integrity ends in the parliamentary building, and as soon as they leave, the parliamentary integrity does not act.
A member of the parliament said that the party led by Morgan Zwangiri is "threatened" by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and service costs reduction program.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two stock market companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the faster-developing hardware and service sectors.
The calculations resulting from the expected reduction of jobs will amount to approximately $2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, according to a statement from Hewlett-Packard.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, Chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard now, and the portfolio of business directions will be wider and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style,” Wittman said.
As an individual company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and will “focused on providing previously unavailable comprehensive technological solutions” to companies, the company said in a statement.
This is how the company, founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hülett and Dave Pacard for the production of electrical equipment is divided; their garage in Palo Alto was called "the birthplace of the Kremlin Valley."
Hewlett Packard is in the process of a large-scale reorganization with the aim of passing from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This step of HP, the world’s second-largest personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest event in this sector, based on the confidence that closely specialized companies work better.
Arsenal Captain Michael Arteta says his club members must support the injured Jack Wilsher before playing with Dynamo Zagreb.
In a conversation with Wilsher Wenger also emphasized that it was only September, and that if Wilsher's restoration goes as planned, then nothing prevents him from returning to the game for Christmas.
With the most favourable development of events, Wilsher will definitely miss at least four of the following games in England and, taking into account what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains under question.
The worst in this recent problem is that Wilshire confidently ended the previous season with the only trauma of the boat and intended to return to the usual aggressive style of play during the pre-season training.
Wenger: “This injury does not threaten his career.”
It’s just not an end-to-end bone.
Nothing serious.
It is just a coincidence.
This does not have to do with trauma or trauma that he has suffered before.
These may be related things from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also allowed, there is associated with this risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also a negative trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has recorded 23 different injuries that happened to him in the six years after his debut.
In addition, he only played in 65 of the 157 games of Arsenal in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the layout for "Arsenal" wider, you can notice that in six of eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, "Arsenal" was one of the two Premier League clubs, on the account of which the most missed due to injuries days.
Wenger acknowledges the possibility of shooting in the golden circle, but Arsenal believes that improving trauma statistics in the last season will continue.
“Sometimes, returning to the order after the injury, you become vulnerable for some time – during this time you need to restore strength and gain a competitive advantage,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough and can do it.
I hope he will recover physically, and I am confident that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal starts its Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a match with Dinamo-Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday with games with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger is planning to make a rotating of the team.
Etor Bellerin and Aaron Ramsay have not arrived in Croatia, so it is most likely that Mother Debush and Arteta will play in the start.
Per Wenger will also introduce Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Gira in place of Naco Morayal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give a little breath to the players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is the unconditional favourite in group F, the Maximir stadium in Zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
"Dinamo" has not lost any of the 41 matches since they managed to spend last season as "Invincible".
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was exposed to a 3.2 ball earthquake on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal has learned the lesson received last season when the team was defeated in the Champions League game from Monaco, and remains with a weak hope to lead the club to win in the Champions Cup final.
“This is an incredible drive,” Wenger noticed.
Arsenal has never done that.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I am realistic with the experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreams.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The absence of such stories is thrown into the eye, especially if considering how desperate the needs of men in honesty have become, now more than ever, with the rate of suicide among young men being at a maximum in 15 years.
In 2013, it became the only major cause of death among men aged between 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and with men it occurs three times more than with women.
In an attempt to solve the problem, the Campaign Against Unfortunate Life has declared 2015 the Year of Men to challenge a culture that does not allow men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression found that if the patient has a large number of friends "in normal mood", the chances of healing are doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not in depression, the circle of mentally healthy friends double the chance of mental disorders.
But for friendship to work, first of all, it needs to be.
In a time when communication is managed by social networks, when style prefers content, the speed of response is often valued more than the content contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to look strong, loving fun and successful, even if loneliness runs in reality.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values – money, images, social status, entirely by means of internal values, our inner aspiration to personal growth and friendship, which strongerly affects our mental health.
And, as one billionaire recently noticed, the video game maker, for money you won’t buy more happiness at all.
The merit of Friends is that they attract this attention.
Each of the characters was determined not by their work, but rather by the personality that appeared in communication with friends.
Joy's humor and Chandler's constant embraces, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's breathing on Rachel - all comes from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As the Samaritan staff told me, “...my role as a listener for people who feel depression and suicidal mood highlights how even the smallest communication of friends can benefit.”
Often the men who address us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old teaching “live with this” strongly, just as the feeling that an open conversation about problems can be perceived as a weakness.”
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-working overcoming mechanisms.
It highlighted the unseen moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of a stranger, speaking by phone, helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from the close circle of family and friends.
So if you’re visiting FriendsFest in Comedy Central this weekend, where for the holiday completely restored the decorations, why not take your friends to drink in Central Perk.
Or even better - if you see a lonely person at Starbucks, smile and say "Hello."
You don’t know in advance what kind of friendship can benefit.
Friends show on Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 series, tagged #FriendsFest
Di Maria gets a goal, helping PSG defeat Malmö
Angel di Maria, along with Bless Matthew and Edison Cavani, celebrates the golden balls at the Gate of Malmö.
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal, allowing the PSG to easily overcome Malmö on Tuesday.
Here is the match report and the response to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edison Cavani did their job when Paris Saint-Germain started their game in the Champions League with an extremely convenient 2-0 victory against Malmö at Park de Prens on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the Champions League as a PSG player began to set the direction to the champions of France, but they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their advantage when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and the Donetsk champion in Group A, Money had to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, as they did not target the play-off qualification, but the continuation of a series of successful games in the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned glasses, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later to replace him on the field in a game against a team from his hometown and the club in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy - to win at home or in the Champions League guests, so to win 2-0, bring the opponents to trouble and play great in defense - it's a good start, even if there's still moments that we'll need to work out during the season," Blan said.
This is promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I regret we didn’t score one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovic returned after a wound in one of the replacement in the composition of the Paris team, which brought her a niche with a score of 2:2 in the match with "Bordeaux" in the First League in the weekend, but he moved him back on Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker was noted as a player capable of bringing the PSG to a new level in Europe after being bought from Manchester United last month, and he demonstrated why when he escaped on a pas from Marco Verratti behind the defense of Malmö and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball to the remote corner of the gate.
However, if someone expected a easy and big victory from the PSG then, they had to be disappointed.
Malmo, which defeated Celtic in the play-off to reach this stage, having nine world-class players on the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two backed semi-defenseers in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of the hit of Nicola Giurgić, in which the ball fled over the far staircase of the Kevin Trapp Gate in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a little.
However, the PSG was sometimes deceived by unsuccessful transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half failed to realize at least five attempts, and then failed to process the ball captured by Kavani immediately after the game was renewed.
Nevertheless, he showed himself much more skillful in the accurate passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, receiving which, Di Maria sent the ball with a curved blow, which passed in the front to the stand by the side of Vilanda for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour score thanks to Cavani, the Uruguay man scored his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovic fixed the ball sent to the center of the field from the left flank by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmo had about returning to the game, and only the overtaking of the ball by Viland from a close distance did not allow David Louis to increase the final account before the replaced Esquieu Lavesi did not score a goal at the end of the match.
Malme coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, while the Norwegian said: "Our last match in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, and this is not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
The glory of the money!
It was a wonderful match with them.

White House confirms Xi Jinping’s visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official statement that Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.

The second Forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On 17-18 September in Sochi will be held the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus, in which the Tumen delegation headed by the governor will take part.
About the upcoming event in Sochi and the intermediate outcomes of cooperation is told by the Honorary General Consul of the Republic of Belarus in Tumen, Vladimir Shugla, who was a member of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what tasks puts the Sochin Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on the fruitful cooperation of the regions – important levels of relations between the two states.
It is planned that the plenary session will be attended by the President of Russia Vladimir Putin and the President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
The plenary and sectional meetings will discuss the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, regulatory and legal security and the programs of the Union State.
The Governor of the Tuman Region will speak at the forum.
I think this is a sign of successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The forum will also be attended by representatives of profile ministries and ministries, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will work, including from the Tumen region.
I hope that the forum will help conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk in June last year.
More than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, participated in the work.
At the same time, a very important cooperation agreement between the Tumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The importance of our work is stated by the fact that a meeting of the permanent seminar at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tumen.
In addition, the delegation of the APC of the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus with the aim of studying the experience of the work of the Belarusians in the preparation of staff for agriculture, determining additional points of contact and organizing new investment projects in the field of the agro-industrial complex.
You have recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics are discussed?
During the meeting with the governor of the Tumen region Vladimir Yakuşev, the discussion was about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in modern difficult conditions.
The issue of supply of Belarusian agricultural equipment and the use of financial mechanisms will be concerned - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the end consumer.
The problems in the work of the Tumen trade house "Belshina" and options for preventing losses were discussed.
Questions are important as investment projects must work clearly and bring profit to the region.
It was talked about further supplies of passenger and cargo equipment of the OAO "MAZ", the development of the service center of the OAO "MAZ", which was created in Tumen on the basis of the OAO "TPATP".
The conversation was touched and preparations for the trip of the work delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus until the end of this year.
Another topic of the conversation was the conclusion of the agreement and the signing of the agreement on trade-economic, scientific-technical and cultural cooperation of the Tumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamic relationship promises to get to a new level.
These issues were also concerned by the regional center.
During a meeting with the head of the city administration of Tumen, Alexander Moor, we talked about the renewal of the Tumen bus park.
Approximately 100 buses are already breathing, so a new package of cars from Belarus is needed to work on gas, ecologically clean fuel.
Another aspect: Tumen lift factory cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of lift products of the OAO "Mogilevliftmash", receiving the packaging.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, taking into account the programs for the installation of new lifts in the regional center.
In the framework of the extended powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the governor of the Kurgan region, Alexey Kokoryn, during which the issue of increasing goods circulation and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment to Zuralia was discussed.
A meeting with the Omsk Governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tumen can be called a kind of headquarters of the district.
The region is a polygon to cover many prospective projects, including the work of the Honorary General Consul.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good because they allow many problems to be solved directly and quickly, eliminating their sharpness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the present conditions it is extremely important not to destroy the task, continuing to work on the future.
Matt Damon opposes to focus on the ethnic diversity of people engaged in film production
Matt Damon disputed with African-American producer Ephie Brown, saying behind the scenes that ethnic composition should not be taken into account.
During the Sunday show Project Greenlight on the HBO channel, the famous actor beat Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black heroine in the project-selected scenario.
“Multiple is appropriate when you cast for the film itself, not for the show,” Damon insisted.
Wrathed Brown, unbelieving her ears, angryly screamed "Oh, nothing to yourself, no-nu" all the time as the actor from "Marsyanin" commented on the live stream.
To discuss the finalists of the show to Damon and Brown joined colleagues-producers Ben Affleck and Farrelli brothers.
"I would like the participants - no matter who will be the director - to think about what interpretations of Harmony they are going to adhere," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is killed by a white suter.
The film producer Dear White People argued that the film would be directed by Leo Angelos and Christine Brancatcho; Damon was sharply against saying that "in the end we can get not what we want."
After this discussion was shown on television, social networks exploded with unacceptable comments to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni spoke angry about what was shown in the video: "The explanation of the essence of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room is so white that it is even painful."
Twitter has collected more than 5,000 retweet and 4,000 likes.
Damon's statements appear just when the literary lighting of the racial topic in the media is the sharpest question on the agenda of public discussion.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot by the police in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement has gained popularity throughout the country, calling on lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored populations.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of the candidates for the "Album of the Year" nomination at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
“Albums are still important,” he said.
Like the books and the life of the black, the albums are still important.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to the Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbek’s question of whether the group will be seen as a hatred group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a group of love,” the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show-business figures, producers and media-magnates invited with a visit to the Pope of Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether the actor has accepted the invitation and whether he has met with the Pope.
American Ninja Warrior awarded the first champion
The professional scalar and assistant officer Isaac Caldier on Monday evening became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior", taking home the prize of $1 million.
At this sports show, the seventh season of which has just ended, no one of the participants yet managed to pass all stages of the track with obstacles.
In the final of the season, two players - Caldero and operator Jeff Brittan, reached the final round.
The final task included climbing a rope of 75 feet in 30 seconds.
Brittan was the first to perform the task and placed in the given time, becoming the first athlete throughout the history of the American Ninja Warrior, who passed the outbreak of stage 4, but Caldero managed the task for three seconds faster, making him a winner.
After the victory, passing with incredible effort, Caldier, who was shocked by winning a million dollars, gave an interview to E!News.
"It's incredible to think about it, I've never earned and lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac commented on E! a serious jump in his revenue.
And suddenly... I never even imagined how it was... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Wide met with the Hollywood Reporter to talk about the final and why Brittan, who first passed the track, won’t receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, money is received by the fastest participant.
"If there are more than one final players, the prize is the fastest of them," Wide said.
While money is a wonderful reward and changes life, it still gets huge satisfaction.
I don’t think he feels offended about this.
He is happy with what he did.
He received tons of enthusiastic feedback from fans.
He is a wonderful man and a family member.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, “If I was judged to lose someone, I’m glad it’s Isaac.”
And I think Isaac would feel the same if we changed the roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will begin to be filmed in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers are quietly over the Minnesota Twins.
Minneapolis - The second half of the season was not fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Tigers now occupies the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
Claiming only to be an obstacle, Tigers with brightness won on Tuesday at Minnesota Twins with a score of 5-4 on Target Field.
The Twins missed the chance to cut the departure from Houston Astros to a half-game and take the second place in the play-off by the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroit, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which scattered most of them in the second half of the season.
“All the victories are fun, no matter how they get,” said Tiger’s manager Brad Osmos.
Pitcher "Tiger" Alfred Simon made his contribution to support the attacks, resulting in that Detroit gained three points in the first two innings, then added another one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a petcher in 6 1/3 inches and missed three wounds.
This was only his third high-quality start for nine outlets.
“I just want to finish the year with good results,” Simon said.
Pitchers are not able to drop in each game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
The designated "Tiger" reboot Victor Martinez managed to reboot three strikes and succeeded in two injuries - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first three-shock day since the four-shock time in the game against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“He worked well with the beat,” Osmos said.
He showed himself well in (quality of the better), significantly better in the work of the beat andined this quality for the game.
With three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got their best chance to return to the game.
Central receiver Byron Buxton opened the inning by the duble on the left line of the field.
Wrightfield Aaron Hicks, making a band, occupied the first base, and the second basman Brian Dozer received a strike-out on a summit from Simon before his place was occupied by the left Blaine Hardy.
Hardy passed over Moer, the only player on the way, before the newly appointed scorer Miguel Sano, who hit the double single to the left of the right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners not in the car and a comparative wound on the second base, VerHagen managed to bring the third basman Trevor Pluff to a double play.
This was the 27th time for the top league player this season when Pluff scored the ball on a double play.
After Detroit added an insured wound in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned the RBI a "dubble" in the space between the outfielders against the closing Tiger Pitch Bruce Rondon, and the account was 5-4.
However, the right-hand player beat Sano after three strikes and got his fifth seat.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily untrained Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
The Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against the deserved pitcher, who was on the list of injured before the game itself, missing more than a month in connection with the inflammation of the spine.
“It’s not the start I’d like,” Hughes said, “but as the game develops, I’m feeling more comfortable and so I’ve been able to make a few pretty good shots in the third inning.”
After the first batter reached the first base, Hughes gave the single to the second basman Ian Kinsler.
Walk at two outs of the Rightfield J.D. Martinez brought out Victor Martinez, who made the single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series "0 for 21" with runners in the resultative position.
The third base player Nick Castelyanos tracked the "single", bringing another injury, but Victor Martinez was shot in an attempt to approach the third base, thus the threat was eliminated.
The Tigers increased their account in the second inning, receiving a single-car "dubl" from James McCann's catcher and the two-haut "single" of the central defeat Anthony Gouse, and the result was 3-0.
“This was a powerful hit,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He was not very good, but he got straight to the right point.
Hughes, whose throwings were considered to be, threw in the not brought points with the third inning, after which he was replaced by the right-hand reliver by A. J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three injured for six hits and a walk with four strikes.
NOTE: The right-wing "Tiger" Anibal Sanchez left the players due to the stretching of the right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrew, who had done Sanchez's shoulder surgery in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured since mid-August, is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, the pitcher-left Daniel Norris will leave the list of injured and go out against Twins.
Norris, who came out of the Tigers in four starts since his acquisition in exchange for the Peter Left David Price on July 30, has 1 victory and 1 defeat.
He did not participate in the games since August 20 due to the stretching of the hair muscles.
Tigers and Twins will finish a series of three games on Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will be played by the real-petcher Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
Kadyrov's original complaint on the book "Prayer to God" was submitted to the South Sahalan Court.
The South Sahara City Court has filed an original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov on the decision on the recognition of "extremist material" of the book "Prayer to God: its meaning and place in Islam", reports "Interfax" with reference to the chairman of the mayor Alexander Chuhraya.
The court is now waiting for possible objections of the parties to the proceedings.
Chuhrai refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation on the need to check the court for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
“Let yourself comment on such stupidities,” he said.
On September 11, the South Sahara City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against the judge Natalia Perchenko's decision to recognize the book as "extremist material".
The prosecutor’s office of South Sahalinsk received a complaint on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to recognize extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, not the Qur'an verses.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the judge has made the wrong decision," Chuhrai said.
The decision to recognize the book as "extremist material" was adopted on August 12, 2015.
The Qur’an says, “We worship you and we pray for help,” and “Do not call anyone alongside Allah.”
Kadyrov called the decision-makers of the book "shaythans and provocators."
He called on the Deputies of the State Duma to legally prohibit judicial decisions concerning the texts of the sacred writings.
“I am firmly convinced that the State Government must adopt a law that prohibits judicial decision concerning the texts of the Qur’an and other Divine Scriptures,” Kadyrov wrote on Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to remove posts and comments that give negative assessments to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints on illegal content.
To fight the manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, the Facebook leadership is intended in conjunction with the German Ministry of Justice.
So, the head of the department, Hayko Maas, said that at the moment the ministry, together with social network experts, is engaged in creating a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to track and remove incorrect comments regarding migrants and refugees.
According to Hayko Maasa, it is expected that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for their deletion.
To facilitate the operational blocking of illegal content should also be organizations whose specialists are engaged in collecting complaints from users of the social network on offensive posts.
The leadership of Facebook intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements to migrants and refugees, the head of the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was taken after the German segment of Facebook has sharply increased xenophobic mood.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented in its scale migration crisis that covered the EU countries some time ago.
So, in Germany, all the places intended to accommodate refugees are already overfilled.
The country's authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are placed in bars where prisoners and prisoners were held under the Nazi regime.
There will be a relaxation zone in the Moscow cemetery.
In the near future, several capital cemetery will be equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be the Boutovskaya, Domodedovskaya, and the Scherbinskaya cemetery.
The first zone for psychological rest has already appeared at the Troekurov Cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar areas will appear in other areas of the city.
About this portal m24.ru told Artem Ekimov, who occupies the position of the head of the State budget institution "Ritual".
The relaxation zones will represent small green areas, resembling parks.
According to experts, in such "counters" visitors to the cemetery will be able to rest, stay alone with themselves and restore psychological forces.
In the near future, the relaxation zones will be built in the Domodedov, Butov and Scherbin cemetery, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the GBU "Ritual", in the event of the need for expansion of the cemetery areas, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest masses in the maximum amount possible.
The green plantations will serve as a living castle, which will divide the recreation zones and the squares taken directly under the places for burial.
Experts of the GBU "Ritual" also stated their intention to submit a proposal on the refusal of burial at the funerals.
New cemetery can really become barrierless.
In addition, the GBU "Ritual" told about the willingness to engage in the installation of electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors to the cemetery will be able to find out GPS coordinates and number signs of burials.
In June of this year, the GBU "Ritual" also proposed to adjust the cost of funeral services depending on the time of the year.
Thus, the crossing of the tomb in summer time will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, a week in winter when the earth is frozen.
In the last year, prices for all types of ritual services traveled on an average of 10 percent.
In the Hellenic forests, five days later, a missing fungus was found.
The elderly man found himself alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without provision.
The detection of the mountains was achieved thanks to the joint efforts of rescue workers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old retire from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
Without food and water.
He was sought by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even movies with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was found after a helicopter connected to the search work.
On that day, Vitaly Aleksandrovich, as usual, went to the forest for the opiates and submarines, but not returned to the evening.
The relatives immediately called for help, and the next day, rescuers and unhappy inhabitants from the neighboring village were raised to search for the fungus - only about 30 people.
On the fifth day, a helicopter of the fire and rescue center joined them.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue group of the fire and rescue center of the Smolensk region, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
He went very far, in a different place.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He passed a huge distance in his age.
Miraculously he was alive.
The fungus was delivered to the central district hospital of Helsinki without consciousness, in an extremely severe condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypertension of the body.
As an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days spent in the forest, doctors absolutely do not imagine.
Valentina Nepša, the head of the therapeutic department of the Yellenic CBD: "A patient examination is intended, treatment."
Infusion therapy and antibacterial.
Considering all of his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Aleksandrovich every year comes to Smolensk from the Tambov region.
His grandfather says that his grandfather was going to collect fungi before, but he never deepened far into the forest.
Aleksei Spitchenko, the grandson of the found fungus, shared: "The forest is not near the road, it is in principle not local."
He has been visiting for several years and welcoming his relatives.
I went for the fungi.
He seemed to have gone far and missed.
With the beginning of the fungal season, people are regularly losing in all areas of the Smolensk region.
Only five similar cases in the last few days.
The rescuers remind: you need to walk into the forest in bright clothes, with a small stock of food, spiders and compass.
In addition, it is advisable to leave traces so that you can then return back.

Motor and board electronics were rejected on the plane, but crew did it impossible.
On board the plane were 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was injured during the emergency landing of the plane.
Nobel Prize in Economics: Globalization
The processes of globalization should contribute to the reduction of inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in income of the population in the developing economies, on the contrary, increases.
by Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-qualified workers, says the chief scientist of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Solution Selection of the University of WSE, winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics, Eric Maskin.
Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
The trade borders between the countries are becoming increasingly open.
Globalization supporters predicted great benefits for developing economies.
“And these forecasts in a lot have been fulfilled,” Maskin emphasizes.
So, for example, China and India had a significant GDP per capita growth.
However, not everything is so joyful.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the “powerful” and the “non-powerful” in the poor countries, which is manifested in a large income inequality, and more precisely, the wages.
But in fact this inequality has only increased, says Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies", published in The World Bank Economic Review, which has been translated and quoted by WSE's R&D.
Together with the economist, Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income difference in poor countries increases as globalization grows.
There are specific processes in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin distinguishes four levels of qualification - A and B for the rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After the globalization, D experts from poor countries lack the level of qualification to cooperate with A and B experts from rich countries.
And if workers of level C from poor countries pay increases thanks to cooperation with workers B from wealthy, then workers of level D do not feel growth or their wages fall at all.
The ultimate effect is that the internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in the poor countries and, consequently, to an increase in inequality.
Cremer and E. Maskin proposed a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardo theory of comparative advantages.
It makes it possible to explain why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fouad Aleskerov, an ordinary professor, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Solution Selection, head of the Department of Mathematics at the University of WSE.
And like any powerful theory, I am confident that it will lead to an explosion of empirical work in this field.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-qualified workers.
However, the employees themselves, as the scientist notes, have no funds for this, and the companies are unprofitable to pay for their training.
In such a situation, a significant role can be played by governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds, Maskin says.
The scientist notes that the theory developed in no way calls for the stop of the globalization process, which has brought and produced its fruits in the form of the country’s GDP growth.
Derbent: A living connection of time.
Derbent, one of the oldest cities in Russia, celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
In the program of holiday events - the festival of the national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of past times, the exhibition of derbent covers and the Day of open temples, the historic and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed museum of Peter I.
The medieval stones of the Fortress of Narin-Kala, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all of this seems to have come from the pages of "Thousand and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has remained in its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantine, the Khazarian Caganate and the Golden Order.
The age of the east platans that grow in the yard of the derbent Juma Mosque is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Tree - Monuments of the Living Nature".
The shadow of the scattered crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The visitor of the mosque is sweetened with aromatic tea and cooked with Dagestan flavours - honey injection, harm, mushmoul, miracle leaves, iran and sweets.
During the centuries in Derbent, the great savars are used to drink the tea of numerous guests once.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma-Mechet says that the building was built in the 115th year of the Hajj.
In 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
This is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is impressed by scale and celebrity: the arcades of the couples and swords rely on square columns and are illuminated by the sun rays from the tiny windows.
The content and breeding of bulbs is a traditional hobby of the inhabitants of Derbent.
The owners of the domestic birds put the blueberries in the courts, under the trees, on the shells.
A fascinating view is the rise to the sky of a room of white dolls, similar to the blasts of a holiday fireworks.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians crossed the Caspian doors with a double stone wall.
Going 500 meters into the sea, this building closed the Derbent port.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of the ancient Persian fortification statue.
The cover in Derbent was fabricated in the 5th century, and until today, the technology of this unique craft remained almost unchanged.
On one of the nearby city market streets, covers are sold for any taste - slopes made of shirt, cotton or cotton of all colors and shades, with a wool and without one, with a complex ornament and a strange cave.
The construction of the city began with stalls - neighborhoods with one-storey stone buildings.
Over the years, the mages have almost not changed.
Only satellite plates, air conditioners on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in the Middle Ages, but in the modern city.
The old part of the city preserved the details of the water pipeline built by the Persians about a thousand years ago.
To our days came the ancient sources, where local residents still collect water.
Many derbentists prefer ordinary water from cranes water from proven historical fountains.
In Derbent was one of the centers of the racing craft.
Dry and scratched vasses, dishes, cakes, cups were appreciated throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of the runners are now making wonderful ceramic products for both practical and souvenir purposes.
In the days of holidays and festivals the crowd of spectators gather under the stretched channel, on which the students of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of amazing and risky skill tells us several centuries.
The new trend is that among the channels you can see girls more and more often.
In the room of the former Girl's Bath today works the Museum "Culture and Life of the Ancient Derbent".
Previously, unmarried girls and brides were washed here in the accompanying of friends, and now anyone who wishes can see a swimming room, hot and cold swimming pools, gone into the past accessories for swimming.
The majority of Derbent houses have hot water, but baths and couples are popular today as they were in ancient times.
About the benefits of heating the body by pair is written in ancient books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, the body acquires flexibility and lightness.
The festival "Society", which takes place on the territory of the Fortress of Narin-Kala, is attended by ethno-powerers of many districts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, perform the songs of the peoples of the Caucasus, and prepare visitors with delicious domestic cheese.
Kirchlar is the place of the funeral of forty martyrs who put their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most respected complexes for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
The long-term sarcophages are cut out of whole stone blocks and oriented, as the Arabs accepted, to the east-west axis.
The brothers Gabriel and Albert Yakubov cut and brush customers in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
Parking has been in this place for many years.
The receipts of the circle are transmitted from generation to generation.
At the same time, the brothers of Jacob can make not only the traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old Town, a house was preserved, in which the Caucasian writer-decabrist Alexander Bestozev-Marlinsky lived.
Studying the Turkish language and collecting ethnographic material, he described Derbent in the first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, the life and life of the citizens.
Taihan is a traditional club of the East, where only tea and home baking are served.
Men come here to ease thirst, talk to friends and solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not recommended to cross the chahan threshold.
Derbent dance ensemble "Caspius" was created three years ago, but has already managed to take part in events of the Republican and Russian level.
The solists of the ensemble re-exercise every day, studying in perfection the popular Avar, Dargin, Tats, and Armenian dances.
With the arrival of the evening, when noise is over and street lights are burning, local residents are sitting on the shops near the houses with outgoing terraces.
Normally, the derbents discuss household issues.
But in front of the anniversary, they are increasingly reminding of episodes of the unique history of their city, which has affected the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
In Domodedov, a business "game to the airport" took place.
There is a new form of education in the city.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport employees.
For this purpose in Domodedov, the models of three air cabins were mounted.
The young people not only monitored and registered passengers, but also served aircraft.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but in the complexity it was not downward to reality.
Late flights, immediately two passengers with fractures on board, traps lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
The airport is Hell.
For the one who was founded in the Ancara Domodedova - a standard set of tasks that are to be solved by the beginners.
There are three major airports from different countries in the world.
Today there are four hundred students from capital colleges and universities.
An unprecedented opportunity to know everything about the internal world of the airline.
Registration of passengers, aircraft service, luggage circulation - they were entrusted even by buses on the airport, traps and passengers inspection.
Passengers are problematic.
One had a failure with the documents, the other was late on the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And to deal with all this is necessary, as in life - in a minimum time.
For each of these tasks they are charged a certain amount, virtual money, as if the airline had paid them the corresponding amounts for the service of the flight.
“For the failure to perform the relevant tasks, a fine is charged with them,” explains in an interview with the program “Vesti-Moscow” the financial analyst of the game Dmitry Hilko.
The work is closely monitored by the Ministry of Education.
For them this exam is an attempt to try a new form of learning.
She has already found a place in the course of secondary professional education.
"Six interregional competence centers will be formed, which will become, in essence, new models of activities of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified staff, with modern equipment," says director of the State Policy Department in the field of training of workers and additional professional education of the Ministry of Science of Russia Natalia Zolotareva.
But students are not up to global plans.
After three days of this training, they seem to need a breakthrough.
However, the assessment for this exam had a very material expression.
The newest smart glasses, the best I’ve ever seen!
"I got them for having responded timely to the claim to our airport on Instagram," said the player, the pioneer manager of the Frankfurt Airport team, Sergey Shuvalov.
The best judges, the so-called, took a pencil to invite themselves to work at the time of completion of the study.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the U.S. Centre in Moscow.
The U.S. Embassy in Russia has expressed regret over the closure of the U.S. Centre operating at the Library of Foreign Literature.
The center has been working in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the U.S. Embassy Centre at the All-Russian State Library of M.I. Rudomino in Moscow.
“The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times question the commitment of the Russian government to the relations between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted even during the Cold War and in other difficult moments of the long history of the relations of our countries,” the U.S. Ambassador John Teft said in a statement.
The American Center created deep and strong connections between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a place of meetings with numerous American prominent figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Only last year the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and welcomed more than 50,000 Russian visitors,” the diplomat said.
About a year ago the decision was made to close another Russian-American joint project – the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Court is urgent.
A typical situation: Four officials standing before the table of Judge Swatanther Kumar, listening to his claims to the work done.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn’t give you a 110-page command so that you could throw over it,” Kumar says.
If there is even another rubber, we will order to remove all the existing buildings.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial body established in 2010 to stop the rapid environmental pollution, accompanied by the sharp economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Court was able to consider more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, waste collection, geological developments, toxic waste, and buildings.
In two of three cases, the court decides to terminate the construction that leads to pollution.
The rates are incredibly high: in the unfulfilled 60 years since the announcement of independence of increased industrial development, India has turned from a country of virgin jungles to one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is severe in large metropolis, where the development of infrastructure does not follow the rapid urbanization: cities are covered with a thick smoke, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste of enterprises and households, and a few remaining residential masses are extinguished under construction by new residential neighborhoods.
Despite the formal support of the Green Movement by the state, the NST is regularly criticized by the government of Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of the largest investment projects.
In May, the Minister of the Environment called the court’s decisions “extreme” and “incomplete”.
Sometimes the judgment of the court is really impossible to fulfill within the period set by the court, affirms environmental lawyer Raj Panjvani.
However, unfulfilled delays also have a positive side: at least, they force the responsible people to walk.
“His main objective is to break down this system,” the lawyer added.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly cancelled large buildings: on its account the termination of the construction of the airport, power plants and hundreds of smaller buildings.
At the same time, people are also trying to not forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telangana, which contaminated the local river with fluoride.
We may close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
“People will lose their jobs,” Kumar commented on his decision.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can change thanks to one scratch of the judge pen.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years of age entering the capital, which caused public anger.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and criticism, Swatenter Kumar refused to cancel this decision.
Instead, he ordered from the government of Delhi statistics on entering and outgoing motor vehicles, and also proposed to buy 10,000 additional buses, knowing in advance at factories whether they are able to perform such a order.
As such sources of pollution, such as debris, fuel quality and even road accidents began to get into the field of attention, the people's anger began to slow down.
But the most painful topic of the fundamental judge was the Gang River Cleaning Program, with a pump announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Gang, a holy river for the Hindu, the judge often ceases to suppress his emotions and goes on to cry.
Do you know what the word “Saint” means?
Someone threw the water out of Gang on the statue of God, and there were feces, the judge burns.
You continue to contaminate the river because you think: Gang is Gang, he will take up all our sins.
This is the river that we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
Ganga Cleaning is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm more than 120 times.
Every year, 1.5 to 3 of the 700 million Indians swimming in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Gang's Rescue Fund the money derived from the sale of his costume in which he met Barack Obama and 455 items from his personal collection.
Ecologists immediately accused the premiere in populism: the costume was purchased for $700,000, while the river cleaning takes at least eight billion.
The supporters of the Green Court agree that India will have to go a long way before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that the price of progress should be ecology.
“In a developing country, conversations about the environment are often perceived as unacceptable luxury,” says Malika Bhannot, the Zov Ganga activist.
And the court is trying to find the golden middle between environment and development.”

Xi Jinping calls on to make the economy more open to the world
The economy should become more open to the whole world to drive its growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in address to the group facing the task of leading the reforms.
“China must focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop an openness policy,” he said, addressing the participants of the 16th meeting of the Central Lead Group Committee on the comprehensive deepening of reforms.
According to him, the expansion of openness and the deepening of reforms will give the economy a new impuls and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The leading group adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of regulations for investor access to the market, the change of the rules of border control, the encouragement of public enterprises (SOE) attracting private capital and the review of the registration system of residents.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will gradually dissolve through testing programs.
This is an important step as it will give the market a more significant role in the distribution of resources, ensuring legality in the business and increasing transparency, as stated in the statement.
The government will also weaken control over the powers granted to the companies, ensuring that the companies themselves will run their business.
China will allow border regions to acquire new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to strengthen local growth.
More spheres will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of state-controlled sectors of the economy.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign funding, as well as provide them with better conditions,” the statement said.
Furthermore, the procedure for submitting applications for permits for permanent residence for foreigners, or "green card", will be simplified by optimizing requirements and simplifying the process of submission itself.
The meeting also discussed the protection of the rights of lawyers and the issues of training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report released after the meeting, it also attended Prime Minister Li Katyan and ministers Liu Yongshan and Zhang Gaoli.
