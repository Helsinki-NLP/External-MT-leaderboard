The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Conditorei".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new ODS colleagues in the Prague Council and in the city council.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has somewhat "bumped" members of the new ČSSD council as they dominate the notorious snake that has naturalized itself in the recent years when the current coalition partners in Prague were at the wheel.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the late era of Mayor Pavel Bém, is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils were somewhat obscured with regard to these new terms.
At least you say that.
“Who is Voldemort?”
“I have no idea.”
“I’m rather a newcomer in Prague politics,” Lukáš Kaucký, the new counselor for culture, responded to the test of the “Paten vocabulary.”
But councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - also reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term “golf hole”.
"That's the only expression of those you present to me here that I use from time to time."
“I don’t like much of Slang.”
From the vocabulary published by Tageblatt Aktuálně.cz in June of this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial board picked out six terms, mainly those notoriously associated with the Prague Magistrates.
The Social Democrats should define the terms “Voldemort”, “Prague’s greatest hole in the Gulf”, “go to the bakery”, “starrace”, “betrayal of the capital” and “blur.”
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth – Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system – first promised to participate in the conversation, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth counselor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
“I don’t care about these things, and how the Democrats talk to each other, I don’t judge.”
"For me, it is important how we understand ourselves within our programmes," he said.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kauckýly did not realize in the above-mentioned headline that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor of Bém, Roman Janoušek, was talking.
The term “Voldemort” says nothing to Kaucky at all and the only term he learned correctly during the test was “the largest Prague golf hole”.
“That’s the Blanka tunnel,” Kaucký said, adding, “but I know it from the newspaper.”
And jokingly, “I’ll probably have to take a language course.”
The "golf hole" will then be correctly deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Minister for Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý as Tunnel Blanka.
Both Social Democrats, however, also know who the term Voldemort stands for, and Lukáš Plachý even guesses where this figure is to be found and thus what it means to “go to the bakery.”
"I think, that is, to go to some Prague catering company," Plachý is pretty close to solving the puzzle, knowing that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In accordance with Březina, however, he argues that he derived this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary was his own.
Judging by the test participants, there seems to be no similarly naturalized snake among the Social Democrats.
“I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us.”
"We call each other by name, sometimes we also use abbreviation or nickname," says the Chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called by his party counterparts "Hulda".
"At school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues also call me so," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz tried the name and see there - it works.
Ratsherr Weinert is friendly to the party comrades the "Opa" or less friendly to the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who before the elections drew attention to himself through machinations in party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
So nicknames are the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in the internal party language use.
Hulínskýly dislikes being called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of the Rubber Knight Rights" is allegedly due to the fact that Petr Hulínský acquired his title of Doctor Juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and released a brochure
Women stamped as witches in Burkina Faso typically have some common social traits.
They are more likely to belong to the older generation, they do not find work - for example, for health reasons, they are unemployed and have no children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
“Men are rarely affected by this fate.”
"Even young and healthy women are spared, as they help work and give birth to children," a religious nurse describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special shelter of more than one hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government has now decided to take action against this abnormal “social measure.”
And for this reason, he issued a brochure aimed at stopping the "witch hunt."
But the matter has a hake.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "derStandard" pointed out to the dilemma of written education.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men – they poured oil on her and simply set her on fire.
The incident was by the BBC server.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the incident was only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, there is oil burning, which is used for ritual ointments.
That is, after the group tried to “destroy a evil spirit” from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports people here regardless of their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "Freshers of human souls were a danger in the past as they are today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to de-escalate the witch hunt, the Gambian president in the past year has properly involved the president himself.
“President Yahya Jammeh launched a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt’s death, as they allegedly participated in her death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic.”
“To do this, he called on shamans from Near Guinea who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president’s bodyguard, violently abducted women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the president’s farm in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an absinthe from plants with a hallucinogenic effect, but which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the people arrested did not survive their stay on the farm.
Due to international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He warms up in the oven, but still pays higher rent
An elderly disabled man is just leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "Coal Baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm, a map with three new rental contracts for three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is just serving a prison sentence.
All three were raised in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns monthly rent, the son is expected to raise 4100 crowns next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there is not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he ticks angry with his finger on the son's new lease contract, to which he has a power to sign.
“But what – I signed it,” he explains half discouraged and half resigned.
The citizens’ association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as “incorrect and immoral”, advises tenants simply not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7, when they intend to publish a guide on how to act against such contracts.
But the man just wipes off.
“One says this, the other that,” he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava is thus becoming a large "deregulation laboratory".
After the New Year, this deregulation is ahead of most rented apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not pay market-appropriate rent so far.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already at nine o’clock this Tuesday morning is breaking full.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and there is a calling device.
"Hire 2011", so a special keyboard on the touchscreen lights up.
Shortly typed and already spit out a number sheet.
We have hardly decrypted the number "157" and it is already ticking on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it is your turn.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent at all.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems – repair applications, insurance matters, and the like.
As of mid-November in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new rental contracts will be placed in the mailboxes of most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio.
The RPG Byty proposes a rental increase of approximately 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for the new rents in the customer center has been open since November 18.
“The action runs a little over a week, that is, that’s just the beginning,” the ladies behind the switch answer after a moment of hesitation as the “client” turns out as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala’s former miners’ homes are a bursting topic.
Prior to the elections, Lubomír Zaorálek, deputy deputy chairman of the parliament from Ostrava, from the ČSSD, had taken this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
“For twenty years I want a new ground from them.”
“They couldn’t even change toilet glasses,” the man mentioned at the beginning said.
So far, according to the employees, mainly retirees are at the switch to make sure that they really get the promised tenant discount that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer on time.
In the enjoyment of a half-reduced February rental will also come the other tenants who sign the new rental contract by December 15.
Until now, however, the "deregulation switch" in Havířov is all but overloaded by demand.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rents in 2011 were due here," Schalter officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both its websites and wallpapers where necessary.
However, if the parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not meant to be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and entirely legitimate legal approach," RPG said on its website.
"Nobody goes to court here," says one of RPG Byty's employees, and a man on the street in front of the customer center gives her at least partly right.
“I have 13,000 (krones) of pension, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I get the money for a legal dispute,” he says.
Employees are insecure.
“Let’s see.”
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rental ends in much of the Czech Republic on New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rental increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even enough to maintain the housing fund," says Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - it is precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the outraged tenants that, according to the homeowners, is the main reason for the rental increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion dollars in the housing in the years between 2005 and 2010, it is estimated to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the carpet seats in the waiting room of Havířov, a few bright red information appears over and over again.
"The rental increases in 2011 by 15% or less affect 31,200 apartments, which is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
“It always means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter and month,” read on the LCD monitor.
Only with 400 apartments from RPG’s portfolio, the rent increases by 38 percent.
“In these cases, it’s about raising extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square meter,” RPG argues.
With 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not boost rents, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes another obligation on itself: all the income from the rental increase (see chart) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But – in the first place, these should benefit those who sign the agreements on the rental increase.
The architects saw in - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything involved: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the employees of Arch.Design since last year.
The design and architectural office Arch.Design, from whose ateliers a whole series of renowned Brno buildings originated, counted from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint on the premises for its company’s mini-children’s garden.
In a wise outlook, because most of its 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is focused on the project architects to return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Along with the opportunity to work shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of its social program.
This makes it easier for civil engineers to combine their demanding profession and childcare.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management, they managed to win grants from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (subsidies of 2.8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and equipment were purchased and for a period of 2 years qualified personnel and operation was provided.
After the funding is exhausted (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the Minikindergarten 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the processing of the application.
To the children is cared for full-time qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can attend children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but several children alternate over the day.
The kindergarten operation is flexibly tailored to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program content in the mini kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework program of preschool education.
The children are not only playing here, above all, they are offered excellent lessons - from basic insights to preschool lessons, besides they also learn English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What’s more – the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus eliminate the stress of late picking up the children from a distant kindergarten.
Parents use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that there are also natural and loyal employer-employee relationships.
Arch.Design thus ranked among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in the recruitment of new employees, which are family-friendly and through such programs strengthen their human resources marketing.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric oak, the stairs like the backbone of a dinosaur, and the balconies are ripped fish walls.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house, with its organic shapes, received the nickname "Bone House".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, bricks and mosaics, the shell-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features of the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that remind us of nature and living creatures.
Only with a closer look is it noticed that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the entire facade looks even more plastic, dramatic, and the special lighting enhances the gloss of the colors.
The same swinging lines and swollen shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, bars, ornamental elements of doors, and even glove holes and bars.
The Batlló House in the Eixample district on the bustling shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, which was carried out by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but eventually agreed to Gaudí’s idea of an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
The Casa Batlló was not designed by Antoni Gaudí.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his drawing board that the decorations for the reality owner’s representative apartment were created, and the use of mosaics on the façade was also his idea.
However, many other artists and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's House Casa Milá in Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house received its organic shapes from the local inhabitants due to the nickname "Bone House".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism due to the "climbing house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is depicted the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a central heating system unique to the time with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces.
Somewhat strange is her 45-degree inclination already.
In his creation, Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations of the time and was by no means misled by them.
Before the construction began, he obtained the appropriate building permission from the city, but the information he made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the town fathers were so shocked by the result of the completion that they demanded remedy.
The councillors also encountered, among other things, that the building with its pillars even entered the public sidewalk.
However, there were no changes, quite the opposite – just fifteen days after the district’s request in this regard, Josep Batlló submitted a request for permission to rent the two highest floors of the house – and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the 3rd floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the fundamental elements of the reconstruction, all straight angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting spaces.
The social part can be fully connected through the opening of the salon doors and so a larger society could chat comfortably without having to give up some intimacy in more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new façade, the house received a rather unusual roof and two more floors through Gaudi's reconstruction.
Also impressive is Gaudí's play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the light courtyards.
The game of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum level of light.
In doing so, he simply used the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorb sunlight.
The Casa Batlló, which was listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, is now accessible to anyone.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The homeowners decided to take this step only in the year and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly profitable business, the visits were kept, and they were also extended to other common and the rooftop spaces, including the rooftop terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building temple is not a piece of paper, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist passports get a 20% discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers should try to make friendship with one of the residents of the house and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? women have different wishes than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the bed - so mattresses and rust make the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the desires of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, size, health status and, not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior in which the mattress and rust must be subordinated.
A typical example?
In a weekend home that is not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited as they take much longer to “get warm.”
In addition, they are significantly heavier than ordinary polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
For if they do not have enough ventilation canals in the core and still lie on a solid plate, moisture is stuck: so it is not excluded that mold is formed underneath them.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Anyone who has been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
“All the ice hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can’t sleep right here.”
"For their cut-off shoulders, heels and hips, they just need a soft layer of Visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I also recommend these, among other things, to people with diabetes who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can not receive the "information" from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in coated furniture.
That’s why I already provided many ice hockey players and other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam) years ago.
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don’t have to be a famous ice hockey player to learn to appreciate the benefits of Visco foam.
This “miracle” really works.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it smiles onto the warm body.
It presses nowhere, at night you don’t roll around like after a tough fight.
You just sleep much better.
The visco-elastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (brand wounds).
When choosing the size of the mattress, you should still add to the body size the length of the feet, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Both men and women who are 180 cm tall need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should have at least 90 cm of bed width available, that is, a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are suitable.
For comfort and for potential visitors.
Otherwise, the following thumb rule for the ideal bed width applies: "When you lie on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the master of carpenters and room designers, who has been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for years and also lectures this topic in specialized schools.
For a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and their own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equal in height.
Otherwise, nothing remains but to mount the rooster at different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm tall, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should fall on the shape layer and the fine pillow.
"You should not feel the feathers with the hand or while sitting," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully padded beds with mattresses and substrate such as joined Siamese twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the linen can not be washed, which is already happening today.
And since one loses between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat in one night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress is slowly turning into a huge (and congested) sieve.
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, and even a lifetime guarantee on mattresses.
Everything has it if and if.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: for mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, one should not be afraid of the hygiene of the washable, removable clothes, yet it is recommended to use a mattress saver that can be easily removed and washed.
Even though today mattresses are usually made with a round circle lock, so you get two halves after opening (very important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially carried out alone, often tends to look like the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Do you have a solid plate in your bed instead of a rust?
Get out with it!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, you should prefer to provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are no ones already inside) and use mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket feathers and fine pillows.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (including combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable latten roots with 14 to 18 feather bars (lamelles), always paying for roots with a larger number of feather bars, i.e. from 28 and more feather bars, with lordose support in the lumbar spine area and the possibility to regulate the hardness of the latte.
Adjustable lamel roots do not include mattresses with feathers because they do not respond to the ergonomic arrangement.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the feathers, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is about a special fixation of the feathers, which allows the feathers to be pressed or even swung in such a way that they allow the punctual sinking of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Especially for men with wide shoulders.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "man mattresses".
Women are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point elastic wing feeder systems (Lattoflex) or roste with point elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion feeder are intended.
The pressure is distributed to several points, which reduces the tension.
But - if you use a bad (too big and filled) head pillow for the right mattress and the right rust, most benefits are lost again.
Also here a thumb rule: the head pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm large pillow will appear, as the Scandinavians like it, for example.
In the side position, the head pillow (along with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (filled with hive) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their mixtures.
Even with mattresses, the new magic word is “bio”.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used for the production of polyurethane foams - for example, ricinus and soybean oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
“Bio in mattresses means that their core consists of materials of purely natural origin,” explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, you can also use micro-capsules that spread fresh wood or lavender smell while sleeping.
There is also a difference between man and woman.
While the men use a “cooling” plant extract from birch leaves so that the mattress can absorb the heat and cool the body, the leaves have a “warming” effect for women.
Extracts from red pepper beans stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes comfortable warm while sleeping.
What about today’s favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with damaged cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
By combining the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams, multi-zone mattresses are created that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have to raise 7000 crowns and more.
Health mattresses, however, are usually charged with lower VAT because they are considered medical devices.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and rust is not so easy.
Occasionally, there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with visco foam memory for CZK 11,990.
The second one is given for free.
It was the tempur material that introduced the era of viscoelastic foam materials with open cell structure and high density at a cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launches.
Tempur becomes soft in heat, in a cool environment it in turn solidifies.
Thus, it perfectly adapts to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burn, but also generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foam materials are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot pillows, which are designed to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to keep children under control
The fear of their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for the search for cars, can identify people as well, which would be useful in such cases as recently with the traceless disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it is not likely to be larger than a wristwatch.
Many people are scared and frightened by the case of the missing Anička and are looking for ways and means to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of compromising their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS localization devices on the Czech market.
“I admit that there can be misuse of such devices in individual cases, for example, if you put them in someone’s pocket without them knowing, but we haven’t recorded such a case so far.”
“Most customers really buy it for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn’t like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they don’t want to be controlled.”
"The phones initially raised great expectations among parents, but they can be turned off as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms. Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
“In planned abductions, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with him that could be used to locate him.”
“Today it is the phone.”
“If such surveillance devices were more widely used, they would also look for them, as their sales would be accompanied by massive advertising.”
“In these cases, the police criminals are always one step ahead,” says the psychologist.
However, she acknowledges that similar devices can be quite helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers localization services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be configured to report the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the affected person is available."
"In more expensive devices, even a slope meter is integrated, that is, if you fall down and remain unmoving, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr. Čech.
According to him, similar services could also do smart phones with navigation, you just need to play a special software.
The problem with current locating devices is that these are either stitch box-sized devices that resemble trailers or smaller phones.
There is always the risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin of the Macro Weil, therefore, devices that look like normal digital watches are being tested today.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to realize that it is a surveillance or localization device.
"Or he notices this only after a while, which gives the police a time ahead," he adds.
Regardless of the direction in which the development is going - to bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used, as in the vehicle location.
Thus, the combination of location function using the GPS system (just like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current location.
The army has so many firearms that you could wrap the whole Czech Republic but only hold it for two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignition ropes, with explosives to be ignited.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometers of firearms to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have survived for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the ignition rope from STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
In his justification for the purchase of this enormous quantity of ignition wires, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of ignition wires annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, this statement suggests that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnical training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition wires be half-justified.
This is equivalent to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would be enough for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies, that for the training of every new professional soldier two meters of firearms are entirely enough, then the army has created a reassuring supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also in view of the increased need for pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Defence Minister Vondra that they almost no longer have cartridges for firearms, so that shooting exercises are severely restricted due to the lack of means.
Not to mention the shortage.
“I don’t even understand why they buy such an immense amount of lightning strings from us.”
But it’s ultimately their decision, they’ll already know what they need.”
"For us, the army is a good customer, to whom we as dealers want to come as far as possible," says Jan Děcký, Sales Manager of the STV Group.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of firearms by saying that the army had covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, speaks of only a four-year service life of the ignition cord and police and army pyrotechnicians only about two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are also possible," one of them admits, but who wants to remain unnamed, so as a soldier not to be accused of criticism of the army.
After the expiration of the service period, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
These tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantitative discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition line.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," said Pejšek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.
For comparison, the annual consumption of firearms by police pyrotechnicians, who liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood Army, has been barely exceeding 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only such amounts of this ammunition that they can use before the expiration of their life.
Already due to the safety of the pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and thus also reliable ignition wires remains open.
The Ministry of Defense has enormous problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty period, when the two hundred thousand-member Czechoslovak People's Army prepared for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, who addressed MF DNES, the Czech armed forces expect in a few years the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old ignition cord, which they have bought so "cheaply" today.
I still have the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition.
The winning placement in the competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
Last year’s winner of the competition “Small Entrepreneur of the Year” was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story looks like a movie scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
It was only abroad that he realized that there was a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his vacation work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he acquired a failed house with five apartments.
Given that he was a college student in the sixth semester at the time, this was a brave undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented out to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profits back into the house, which he then transformed step by step into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has managed to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another high-end hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already registered," says the entrepreneur number one from last year.
“A large percentage of this sales of licenses for operating hotels was just the victory in the competition “Entrepreneur of the Year,” Mr. Pytloun adds with appreciation.
The victory brought him greater popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that did really well," he remembers.
I really recommend everyone who wants to something to participate in this competition.
You don’t need to win right away, every visibility is good.
He says he still benefits from contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have happened at all.
"With some of the people I met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relationships to this day."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also falls slightly on each of his employees.
And there he is in the seventy.
“I see greater loyalty and pride in them for being part of something that gets general recognition.”
I really see this not just as a personal success, no, it’s the result of the good work of all of us.”
“My name is only slightly highlighted,” says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind it.
The prize for the first place of the competition Vodafone Company of the Year last year was received by Karel Žďárský, the company owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury praised the efforts with which he stumbled out of the small toolhouse in Česká Skalice a company that generates hundreds of millions of sales.
“I can say that this recognition not only encouraged me, but also all my employees, and strengthened our confidence in fighting the competition,” says the previous year’s winner.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history was the effort to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel Žďárský a small workshop to rent in compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate long, dropped his career in the company where he was employed until then, and founded his own company for the manufacture of plastic baths with a few of his father’s comrades.
Shortly after, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have grown into the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it was only through the success in the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it also entered the awareness of the non-professional public.
“Not only do our customers now see the brand Farmet significantly more intensely, our foreign partners have also started to value the fact that they can work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country,” says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, however, was not only in the sign of victory euphoria.
The assessment was based on the company’s financial results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And especially 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of toolbuilding products.
The crisis, which at the time shook even less citizens, but, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
Of course, we could not escape this situation.”
"The sales declined by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and even resort to redundancies," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable business sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
But it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black numbers, though with lower profits than before the crisis.
At one, the company was unwilling to make cuts - in the investment in research and development.
"Of the grant we built a research and training center, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and won major awards at domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner much joy in the victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A poll that clears up with nonsensical regulations
The poll on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some absurd rules have already been created out of the world.
To the questionable winner of the next year of the poll "Absurdity of the Year" advanced the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
Thus, more than a third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested a paper extract from the Commercial Register, even if the official could have obtained it with two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the poll, this is now changing.
“In the future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extras from the Commercial Register when checking social security payers,” said Jana Buraňová, a spokeswoman for ČSSZ.
The purpose of the poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to take into account all the regulations and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to abolish the nonsense.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organized by the Czech Economic News (HN) and enjoys growing popularity among the public.
If last year about three thousand people took part in the vote, this year it was already four thousand.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder the business.
"As for the number of income tax forms, for example, we take a leading position in the world," notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Businesses of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurial activity has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the rest of the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has not improved much.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, an eight-place lower ranking compared to the previous year.
The competition absurdity of the year was announced for the first time this year and takes place each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of September.
For registration, the web address www.firmaroku.cz. After that, the organizer of the competition will select seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and the public will vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
For this year’s poll, more than a hundred, or more accurately, 105 meaningless regulations and ordinances have been.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the competition’s nominated “finalists” are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways have to pay a fee or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to show up every two years.
The list of this year's "seven" is published on the competition pages.
The announcement of the competition at the Wenzelsplatz in Prague at the beginning of November is part of an event in which political and public figures also participate regularly.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Businesses of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the height of the competition.
"Where the state is throwing the entrepreneurs in the legs, there can be no real economic recovery, so my goal is to abolish at least thirty paragraphs each year that now unnecessarily make their business difficult for entrepreneurs," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create nonsensical arrangements out of the world show effect.
In 2007, people were most bothered by the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to have to report to the trade office at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance of their intention to go to an exhibition stand or carpets.
This obligation was abolished by a novel of the Commercial Law.
The obligation, which in 2007 received the second-largest number of votes – the obligation to report to the employment office business trips of employees in the amount of up to 30 days – was abolished by the law on it, so-called “Green Card”.
All good things are three:
The absurdity of the year 2009 was chosen by the regulation, which required physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal weights in the talk room.
This regulation was somewhat softened by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation fell away.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria include humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects.
A novelty in this year’s fifth year of the competition of the Economic newspaper (HN) is the category “Responsible Company of the Year 2010”.
The main aim of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair.
“We want to support such companies that are aware of the environmental implications of their business activities and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile company Vodafon, who is the initiator and guarantor of this competition, as well as of the competition “Rebell of the Year”.
This year’s first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the Year was attended by companies for whom success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and fine enough fabric for a standalone article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, people with disabilities are concerned with personal problems or the health of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera emerged, which promotes the emergence of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory in Poděbrady also takes exemplary care of its disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was honored with the title "Responsible Company of the Region of Central Bohemia"; in the competition Vodafone Company of the Year it ranked third in this region.
In the region of Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, introducing, among other things, a fluid and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportional reduction in wages.
The jury also honored the fact that the company primarily purchases from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in its surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible to minimize the impact of our business and administration on the environment,” explains Miluše Ryznarová, its CEO.
In turn, the responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region is focused on the health of its employees and therefore has acquired ergonomic seats and keyboards for all laptops, in addition, it promotes homework among its employees and uses cartering services offered by a protected home workshop for corporate actions.
“In addition, we support the “People in Need” Foundation, which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community,” says Ondřej Suchý, the company’s representative.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbad region, which contributes to its employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
“We give our employees contributions for food, for work, to improve their qualifications and for vacation,” says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Morocco-Silesian region.
In the category Responsible Company of the Year, all district finalists of the competition Vodafon Company of the Year were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
False or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation.
If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were not disqualified for this reason.
"A separate registration for this competition alone is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the host agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests by the police in a public tender
In the building of the Ground Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police carried out arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was abducted by the detectives in handcuffs.
The latter allegedly sought to manipulate an ongoing public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition fell to a concrete interested party.
Luboš G. paid half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for the crime of fraud in a public competition," Antonie Zelená, the head of the public prosecutor's office in Pilsner, told the newspaper "Právo", not being able to provide further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old businessman was fired by the police.
How he could manipulate public competition can only be speculated in the light of the scarce official information.
Lubomír Černá, spokeswoman for the Ground Fund, quoted Právo’s question on this subject as saying that the police actually carried out arrests in the Pilsner side of the Ground Fund during a public competition.
“It was a client and not one of our employees,” she said.
According to Ms. Černá, the public tender was correctly referred to as “Invitation to submit an offer of rights for the transfer of land in accordance with the Land Act” and would take place in cases where several applicants expressed interest in the land offered.
“These persons offer in the context of the invitation a higher value of their restitution rights to be paid by the transfer than the declared property value.”
"According to the proposed claims, the order of potential buyers is determined, then the land fund transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokeswoman of the fund.
Obviously, Luboš G. had information on who had applied for the invitation, and since he himself was entitled, since he had purchased a number of refund claims, he offered to an interest in land that he would withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat decomposition.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large sum of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had already had too good contacts with Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the case of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing land for replacement restitutions for which construction projects had already been decided on.
At that time, Luboš G. also acquired land from the Land Fund, for example, for the construction of public roads, more specifically, at the place where the construction of the highway to the commercial area of Borské pole was planned.
Later, he exchanged these very cheaply with the magistrate for a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the properties.
At that time, the town hall had to bear heavy hearts in order not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs increase by several hundred per month
From January, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and sewage charges and higher rents for district heating and in some places.
Families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns a month from their wallets as of January.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places the distant heating supplies are also expensive.
Electricity control alone costs households a few hundred crowns more each year.
The price of solid electricity has been reduced by all major suppliers, so it is due to the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely from photovoltaic installations.
Gas will only be moderately more expensive, but this is exactly when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
It is also worth a few hundred crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive across the Czech Republic, the prices for remote heating vary from city to city.
Particularly larger cities are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay up to 50 crowns per month for telecommunications from January, while families in Liberec pay more than 1000 crowns per year.
The residents of Prague, on the other hand, are threatened with 9 percent higher water and sewage charges in the event that the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, prices in Prague are still among the lowest compared to the whole Czech Republic.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to increase by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rental price increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where from January the so-called rental regulation will be removed.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by exactly 100 percent from January.
Anyone who disagrees with this rental increase will be sued by the company.
The regulated rent, which is still being paid in 300,000 homes today, is expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech Children Drinking With Fernet and Rum Beer Is Out – It Just Feels Too Slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally also a good whisky, which was stolen from the father’s house bar.
These are the drinks after which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen are most often in need of emergency treatment.
No exception are children who have to sleep out their cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evidenced by the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the reception of the children's departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine is completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief medical officer of the children's department at Hořovice Clinic in Central Bohemia.
"Whisky, if it manages to steal a bottle from the house bar to the father, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief physician.
The spokeswoman of the Motol Faculty Hospital, Eva Jurinová, gives him right.
“Most often it is about Fernet or Rum.”
“That’s the trend of alcohol today, especially in elementary schools.”
“It was also about Slibowitz, who is taken from home,” Ms Jurinová said.
According to chief doctor Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the hospital are no exception.
Before the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatric department of the Motol Hospital, where the rescue cars delivered drunk students from near and far.
A girl had to be hospitalized four times.
"Her career began at the age of 12, when she was first administered with 3.5 per cent of alcohol in the blood and even in combination with "ecstasy," the doctor described a severe case.
"She was in the exhibition venue in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing about this was that it wasn't strange for her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief physician said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when striking with their own shoots that is considered to be one of the main causes of growing childhood alcoholism.
According to experts, there is no real dependency in the true sense of the word in children.
"Alcoholism means a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all the phenomena associated with it, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who consume alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is mostly characteristic,” explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman of the Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinová, by mid-November about forty drunk children were admitted to the local child and youth medical department.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization enter the statistics.
Drunk children who are taken home after ambulatory treatment by parents or, if necessary, by the police will not be registered.
Except for the cases where children just drop a bottle of alcohol in the school bench, according to Mr. Pelikán, there are three seasonal amplitudes on which one can rely 100%: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of grief for the bad testimony or out of joy for the holidays."
“In the Walpurgis Night, I also saw seven drunk children at once in the recording,” Dr. Pelikán emphasizes.
A drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who struggles only with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning afterwards, which arise from dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be removed in the hospital with a fluid-donating infusion of glucose and nutrients that are lacking in the body.
"They are clearly better off, because after the 'great' experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without hurting anywhere."
"They are just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, sometimes ruining the patient's good mood at least by listing them the costs they will cost the treatment.
Because the transportation by the ambulance and the night in an emergency bed come well and like to a few tens of thousands of crowns.
“Sometimes I used this as an educational tool when I directly calculated to the children at the visit what their drunkenness cost and that it can happen that they have to work the whole holidays to earn the money for a single such feather,” Dr. Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the health funds do not resort to regression procedures to demand the costs necessary to cure the drunken children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two L-159 light fighter jets out of five exchanged by the Czech Defence Ministry for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft flew to the Spanish city of Sevilla on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is established.
This is the first time that such machines are owned by a foreign army.
So far, they have only been seen at air shows or manoeuvres.
This is the two-seat version of the L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech Army.
The other three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are currently in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took them over last week.
When it will physically ship the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, according to the defence ministry spokesman, is not yet known.
The single-seat L-159 fighter aircraft, in turn, were excluded from long-term storage aircraft and this without further deposits and investments from the department of the Ministry.
"The dual-seat L-159T1 has been replaced in its current condition and appearance," Pejšek told the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army will not have to do without two-seat fighter aircraft, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200-million-dollar contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the conversion of four superfluous L-159s into a two-seat version.
One new aircraft took over the army in July, the second plans to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to imposing the combat aircraft on the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the buyer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are to be used for the training of pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore the customer's matter how he realizes the thing," Pejšek said.
The Economic newspaper (HN) had previously that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for SEK 3.5 billion had been approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At that time, the Ministry of Defence had not issued a tender procedure for the purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defense Office argued that this exchange would support future exports of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 aircraft, of which it only used 24, the rest it wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the aircraft Casa is also likely to have a judicial follow-up.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice.The reason? it should have selected the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by a single manufacturer’s response.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the latter is scheduled to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
This is related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should definitely undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health stresses, Ms. Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the study participants, the right hand’s index finger was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the likelihood of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
For men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, however, this risk decreased by 33 percent, and for men up to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are already formed in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone is equivalent to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that he was flightly aware of this study, yet he does not think the relationship between finger length and cancer risk has been "fully proven" so far.
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under snow on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walkways is mostly stuck snow, the winter servants were on axes in many places all night.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents of trucks and cars, and also the D1 near Brno is "stopping" in the direction of Prague.
This was stated by Novinky.CZ, the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At km 91 a truck crashed, at km 93 two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
A few cars are also on the road.
There are also problems at km 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks also collided.
Drivers should leave directly behind Brno at km 190 or go over Brno and get up at km 182 at the town of Kývalka.
There are kilometres of congestion.
There was also an accident on the D11 on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a snow cover several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns are formed, for example, in the district of Prosek, and the Štěrboholská street is also completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The tramways run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o’clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems on the railway and on the airport.
The Czech state railway has been forced to cancel seven high-speed trains due to snow.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be informed about the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed since Wednesday at 11 p.m. to 5 p.m.
Most of the roads in the south are only accessible with increased caution.
Around Vyškov, three side roads are completely inaccessible, in the surroundings of Brno there are some snowflakes and in the surroundings of Blansko you are forced to use snow freezers on some higher streets.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are three roads still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Snow freezers will also need to be used for snow cleaning.
When they will be available again, cannot be estimated so far.
In the region of Hodonín, caution is required in the territory of the White Carpathians.
On the streets, which for reasons of nature protection can only be spread with inert fluids, lies a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, ČTK said.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten centimeters of new snow fell, most in North Bohemia - up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
In the Czech Republic it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new “smart weapon.”
U.S. troops have deployed a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only as the XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precision cannon.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a collision safety of only a few meters.
The special 25mm caliber bullets, designed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, function practically like small grenades.
The missiles can be programmed so that they can explode not only when hitting the target, but at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use them against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the shell.
From above, it is usually not protected, so the murderous steel crush rains from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to take advantage of "smart" technologies.
"The soldier basically acts this way: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains a precise point of focus, after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he only needs to push off.
“Let’s say you measured 543 meters.”
“When you push it down, the gun charges and shoots at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu Group is moving its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specializing in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 of the group’s jobs, which have been distributed across the region, should be housed there.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in Astro Park would be more suited to the work of the employees.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said, “With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
Excellent connections to the airport are of great importance, especially for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday caused joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
Frankfurter Economic Deserter Markus Frank (CDU) said that this has once again won a "global player".
This is a “great location confession.”
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (The Greens), regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
“Of course, we offered our help to the company,” Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have given rise.
Now it is about preventing a long vacuum in such a prominent place.
"I hope that the owner and tenant of the building will show cooperation."
Fujitsu’s previously used building on the Town Hall Square and the adjacent “Little Vertical” were, along with the rest of the buildings on Marienbader Platz, one of the most controversial construction projects in Kurstadt a decade ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the railway station and the town hall, which caused criticism both due to the massive construction of the areas previously used as parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, investment consultancy and rating firm Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, then still affiliated with Siemens, acquired the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu, based in Tokyo, is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies with computers and servers, for example, and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu employs a lot more people in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad will be incorporated, the other subsidiaries at this site will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped foundation - the Central Association of the Electrical and Electronic Industry has its seat, among others.
Amazon shuts down servers after threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly in trouble.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Per there is political pressure behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic records.
WikiLeaks founder Assange isly in England.
WikiLeaks is increasingly under attack in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their former American servers and are now looking for a home in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's search list, is expected to stay in the UK after a newspaper report.
“Wikileaks removed from Amazon servers.”
“Free speech in the land of freedom,” the disclosure activists shared on Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Earlier, Amazon banned Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic records to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted: “Prima – our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has stopped the use of its servers by WikiLeaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman investigated, CNN, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate committee on Homeland Security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian".
"I wish Amazon would have taken this action sooner in view of previous publications of classified information by WikiLeaks," the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be banned from servers in other countries.
“Wikileaks’ illegal, monstrous and ruthless conduct puts our national security at risk and threatens lives around the globe,” the senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to spread stolen material.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is being sought by the Swedish authorities for alleged rape, is on Interpol’s search list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, the exact location is known Scotland Yard.
The internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even rumors about the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is rightly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The founder of WikiLeaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the man responsible for the WikiLeaks disclosures be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper – apparently ironicly – said on television that Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange, there was an outcry.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for recent spying calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website.”
The U.S. government is now thoroughly testing the protection of its databases.
As a special envoy, Deputy Director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Action, Russell Travers, has been appointed, the White House said.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that have become necessary after WikiLeaks’ disclosure of the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to check how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also said it would ensure the safety of dissidents and activists if they were threatened by the WikiLeaks publication.
“We’ve done everything we can to get in touch with them,” Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them if necessary.”
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice conditors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where did all the ice come from?
From the gelatiere and the gelataio.
The gelatiere, in German somewhat ancient the ice conditor, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
The gelataio takes the ice cream from the refrigerator with a spatule, rubs it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But those who want to know more about ice cream do not miss the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University established the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines everywhere meets the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the home ice cream shop.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just dare to the smooth ice of their vague aspirations.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents – from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to do something for herself after years in a nervous job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a ice shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars – and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste is crucial, but also the silky smoothness and good consistency.
In his training, Luciano also does not forget the splash of the national and in general southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacturing seems simple.
Luciano turns the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which with an electronic program heats everything to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a hood at the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all milk varieties.
Immediately the lecturer is overwhelmed with questions: can you make ice cream only with natural fabrics without a stabilizer?
How can you free up your own experimentation?
Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
Those who talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may have still used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guarkern flour from the guarbohne.
Of course, you can also make ice cream without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it will crumble and the customer will bite on loud ice grains.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the smells.
For the taste in the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powder and pasta.
“The suppliers will all try to attract you dozens of aromatized additives.”
“But you should just experiment.”
Either in the fruit orbits with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just the ice cream from the white base mass, which with eggs becomes the yellow cream and with cocoa powder the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to go to the ice machines.
Luciano lets them each make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The same experiment is carried out with fruit varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit purries - taste it is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice doesn’t necessarily taste more nut if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice is made by the working group, which uses more fruit, less water, and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture can properly enhance the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice making is a calculation task: If peach purry is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar proportion in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano draws out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winners thus measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make computing easier.
Making ice does not require as much physical effort as before.
Not only the device for the automatic production of the base mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously creamed and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all the automation, there are no small failures.
The Brazilian Gustavo clothes himself and his classmates from top to bottom with fruit puree when the overdimensional bar mixer gets out of control.
“In every course,” Maestro Luciano says, “it’s just a matter of time before something like that happens.”
Inspectors in Dwielicht
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is concerned about the use of genetically modified plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which understands itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA Expert Group on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have also been under contract with the Ilsi Lobby Association for years.
It is paid by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the EFSA test regulations for genetic plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The EFSA regulations are equal to the position papers of the Ilsi, thus falsifying the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has complained about a conflict of interest.
For example, a senior EFSA manager recently without any conditions or transition time to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and has thus changed the sides.
Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also recently revealed personal links between a controlling EU authority and an industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environmental Office as well as EU parliamentarians clear.
However, the EFSA cannot identify any conflict of interest.
All reputable data, including those from the industry, are used, as long as they are of high professional quality.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contacts with the industry.
You should disclose them.
Kuiper is dedicating his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the United States.
This forum describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics – including for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the matter, independent experts like Then criticize the fact that genetically modified plants are currently being approved without any animal feeding trials and the response of genetically modified plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does on the field,” says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how do you find them?” asks Then accusing.
Angelika Hilbeck is like that.
The scientist has been doing research in genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area, as is the case in the United States and in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
Business critical studies are usually not published.
“The industry controls security research,” says Hilbeck.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell also worried about some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgart train station, the Tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It is snow.
The story is well known: in September, the drillers had arrived and had begun to break off a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgarter Welt was no longer the same: hundreds of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar demolition of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken down into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft rough stone, installed between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few pieces.
“These stones are relics.”
“You must not disappear.”
“A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthly.”
When he stopped, he smelled of cigarette.
What he is going to do with the pieces, he doesn’t know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The track of the Stuttgarter Steine leads to a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen established his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all those who fell on the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were painted into scraps or disappeared in the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden cage that was once a watchhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he told when it was in the newspapers in September that he had bought the remains of the northern wing from the demolition contractor.
But he spoke to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything for the demolition.
And if that happens, then it would be most reasonable if the stones were to be used again.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the quads weighing an average of 80 kilos at a price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but some also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
500 tons had been bought by Rongen, 25 large trucks.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest has been sold long ago.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, house builder.
They came from everywhere and carried away everything that could carry luggage and trailers.
The Stuttgart stones of thrust have long been transformed into "murals" or into limitations of herb beds.
“Actually, this stone is nothing special,” Rongen says.
“It’t be the political component.”
He climbs into his off-road car and makes a tour of his 20 hectare empire.
He studied law and graduated, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone trader.
and stone lovers.
There are 40,000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany he gathered his treasures.
He says he is the largest antique dealer in the republic.
He is braking.
In the snow there are artistic sandstones.
“They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke,” he says.
Elephant sandstone, yellow, warm, he swarms.
“My favorite stone.”
The road goes up through the forest.
It points to a bunch: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruher railway station.
and on.
“A beautiful travertine.”
The squares once belonged to the tribune of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgarter Police Presidium, red granite from the St. Blasien Cathedral, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen recalls how the stones were previously carved by hand and moved with simple bottle trains and bull chariots, he becomes quite reverent.
“It would be a scandal if something like this were to happen.”
He has not become rich, he has not become rich at all.
But 14 people are employed by the stone merchant today, besides having settled upstairs in the forest stone metze, a sculptor, a forger, a glass blower and a gardener.
“We’re working hard, but it’s satisfactory,” says the residual assessor.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to be saved.
Struggle for high potential
There is rule in the buffet.
16 students press for salmon breads, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automaker Volkswagen have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they will work with VW developers on the car of the future – and get to know Volkswagen.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies now go into the close struggle and, like VW, rely on cooperations with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates in the auditoriums as early as possible before they enter the job market and be re-reported by others.
And because the universities do not publish lists of the achievements of their students, they try to trace and bind the exceptional talent in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the automotive companies promote the talents.
A young lady from the human resources department distributes balls, rubber bars and folders with the VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talent of internship programs and student jobs and shows them paths into the group.
Nico Selle of the TU Braunschweig oversees the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: “Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience.”
"VW can also get to know students, look closer at interesting candidates and consider who would be eligible as an employee."
Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
It is new that it is so offensive about the students.
“Otherwise, the focus was on the technical project,” says Selle.
The struggle for new graduates will be even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer select their employees from a large number of candidates.
Instead, they must praise themselves, especially for highly qualified workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineering jobs remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even greater, according to VDI forecasts.
For the audit and consultancy company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a type of modern hunting where participants must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students across the United States next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Whoever is eligible will be selected in two rounds in advance.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many applicants flies to the United States.
As the high-potentials at the universities hike and sting, the guns are becoming bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
“We want to get out of the crowd with the race.”
“Only a simple sailing door was too little for us.”
For talent hunters, Dykta seems to be raising the bill.
“We have been in contact with all participants in a similar event last year.”
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct buzzing on the campus, especially small and medium-sized enterprises are also very typical at professional fairs.
"We try to reach graduates at trade fairs."
“About on the Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, HR manager at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the neonatal problem.
Currently there are 35 jobs on the company’s website.
“It is very difficult to occupy vacant positions.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give clues that you can do internships with us or write your thesis."
Expensive advertising campaigns are not suitable for the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large corporation can often not offer this," says staff manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the primary role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good upgrading opportunities are other crucial factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute prepares an annual list of best German employers.
To do this, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their work environment and looks at the framework conditions for employees.
Staff manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also benefit job seekers.
“I think applicants are especially looking for external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as employers with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers for more authenticity.
And that means, according to warriors, primarily internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through your own employees,” he says.
In the industry jargon, internal employer branding means employer branding within your own workforce.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
If you treat your people well and identify with the company, they would advertise for their employer in friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a game with gangs,” says Kriegler.
Obama to stop new oil drilling
On the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
A similar ban has been issued by the government in Washington – and thus finally revoked its previous plans.
New drilling is also prohibited off the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is expected to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disaster that killed eleven workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his readiness to allow for new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The aim is to reduce the dependence of the United States on oil supplies from abroad.
Who is responsible for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf is not yet clear.
At the centre of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is facing billions of claims.
An investigation commission commission commissioned by Obama is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tighter security rules, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe.
Currently, the competent supervisory authority, which has been suspended following numerous corruption allegations, is undergoing fundamental reforms.
At the same time, Obama has announced that he will close lucrative tax gaps for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the supply volume in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake to the growth of the oil and gas industry," the results of a recent industry survey by the consulting firm BDO - even ahead of the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also lamented the uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation.”
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further – at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned.
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like a gas station: billions of liters of exhausted crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari is good.
“Don’t worry,” the ecologist reassures the journalists, “you’ll get enough oil sludge out of the lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to paint a boy watering up to his chest in the water with the slides surrounding him: in the rainbow-colored water glow, the scene looks almost beautiful.
That under the surface floating brown crude oil swords is not visible.
She used to harvest garlic here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, huge amounts of crude oil spilled out of a broken pipeline into the enormous wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to ride six hours to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the world’s worst-pested regions.
On the journey through the mangrove bushes, which are carried through rivers, the full extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat blows up brown bouillon, whoever plunges his hand into the water draws out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise out of the ground like black lacrimal sticks, sadly leaving the palm trees hanging their weddings.
Bird heat, as is otherwise common in wetlands, is sought in vain: as soon as the outer border is silent, a ghostly tranquility spreads in the former paradise smelling like a gas station.
“What’s happening here is ecological warfare,” says Celestine Akpobari finster, “we live in constant health danger.”
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement is a battlefield that has been fought for decades: here the first explorers from Europe invaded more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is denied the return to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire Delta region of three times the size of Switzerland with over 5,000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland have broken, the situation is too unstable for the group.
Every few hundred meters, steel stalls like bizarre sculptures rise from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the drilling holes much too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the mark.
Again and again, such a drilling head breaks apart, Akpobari thinks, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
More than two billion liters have flowed into the delta ecosystem in 50 years, according to experts: year after year, the amount of oil that went into the sea outside of Alaska in the crash of the super-tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
Who is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU is controversial.
While the Shell Group holds sabotage and organized oil theft responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see rotting drilling heads and leaky pipelines as the main cause.
Shell imposes significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than otherwise is common in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner accused the group in 2008: the rate of defects on the pipelines alone is "a many times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil lubricated workshop under the open sky from a distance, figurines emerge from the mangroves: they are scattered naked and oil lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with pipes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire blows: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrels, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the pipe, later, at the end of the pipeline, petroleum drops out, and finally, diesel.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300-liter diesel per day: "This brings us 34.000 Naira" - about $ 22.
Delta residents take advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cookers can still subsidize the ridiculously low diesel price of almost 40 euro cents per liter: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" that seize the pipeline network across Ogoniland: in this way, according to experts, the country loses at least 16 million liters of crude oil every day throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a disappearing small part of the interim stored raw material is illegally refined: the lion’s share is filled in tankers by organized criminal networks, which include politicians and senior military personnel, and spread to the world market.
The debate about whether the environmental disaster is due to the displacement of the population or the loose mode of production, the activist Akpobari considers to be purely academic.
“If oil companies weren’t perceived as invaders and had not so thoroughly destroyed the livelihoods of fishermen, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries.”
Meanwhile, the Ogoni’s relationship, especially with Shell, was so damaged that only a withdrawal from the group would be in question: “Maybe other nationalities such as the Chinese appear to be better.”
Michael is nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says the muscular oilman.
“Every minute the soldiers can come.”
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not in danger of arrest, but probably a painful money.
Even the soldiers, mostly from the north, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from the raw material.
“This damn thing has brought our country to the dog in every way,” Akpobari says.
Investigators Discover Dangerous Construction Faults in A380 Engines
The A380 appears to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered during the investigation of an emergency landing machine a possible construction defect that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas has filed a lawsuit against the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the crashed Qantas Airbus in early November appeared to have had much more luck than before: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s during its investigations - and now warns of a possible construction defect.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: with an oil tube connection, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, the ATSB said in a statement released on Thursday.
This could have resulted in a “catastrophic engine failure.”
Rolls-Royce engines in 20 aircraft of the A380 series were affected.
The Qantas Airbus landed in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has initiated legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint with an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing her to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had dissolved and the support surfaces had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce caused oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the accident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators announced that they will conduct further safety tests on the Superjumbos, which are equipped with the engines affected.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue was considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine on an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Snowfall Causes Traffic Chaos
Almost all of Germany has snowed overnight.
There is chaos on many roads, trains and flights are stopped.
In car accidents at least three people died.
Winter freezes Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the entire republic has snowed on Thursday night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east are some 15 cm thick snow coverings.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but was not completed with the constant new snow.
There were also heavy rains over the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm floods on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal level.
In Saxony, snow flooding on motorways and federal roads caused significant problems.
According to the meteorological center Meteomedia, therefore, in Saxony Switzerland, the alarm level was violet - the highest level ever.
In part, 30 centimeters of new snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused waves.
Several trucks and cars were stuck overnight.
In Saxony-Anhalt, the police also major disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 snow and wind led to congestion and traffic congestion.
In Thüringen, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thüringen and in the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the lanes, falling trees on the lanes or destroyed upper lines and slopes are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringia Saalfeld, an ICE to Munich had to stop its journey.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue workers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept over the streets.
On major German airports, the snow winds cause numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, several cancellations have already been.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokeswoman, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The winter service is permanent.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still almost 400 field beds available for them.
Many accidents occurred on the streets on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train on a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: here too, a truck was caught on a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train and the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked until the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after hitting herself with her car on a smooth road near Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists have good news: although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore swirls up in light snow.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is plagued by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could be invested in the property.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters beautiful: the twin towers in the Frankfurter Bankenviertel have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group seems to want to recover the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes, citing a spokesman.
The reason for the planned sale was not stated.
"We are always looking at whether it makes sense to own or sell properties ourselves and then rent them back," he said.
Germany’s largest credit institution will return to its headquarters after a short time.
The bank had only acquired the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a home-owned fund and subsequently thoroughly renovated.
The energy transformation consumed approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers", according to the newspaper, at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will again be sold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn for dead friends
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand thought of the dispersed miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies were still unable to be rescued because the security situation is still precarious.
Two weeks ago, an explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were dumped underground.
A probe had been dropped into the crash box, but had not found any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescuers were not able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance for the companions to survive.
The bodies have not yet been rescued.
Families and friends are now commemorating the dead.
Thousands of people gathered in Greymouth on New Zealand’s South Island.
They remain silent for two minutes.
In honor of the dispersed miners, 29 tables were set up, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the comrades were displayed.
Pictures and personal items, including clothes and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings, the flags waved half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth," New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the attendees of the commemoration.
“But you never came home.”
"He can't finish with his son's death until he has seen his body," said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was shed into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the commemoration.
The first explosion on November 19 also killed miners of British and South African origin.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases are removed, the burning temperatures inside the mine will begin to cool down, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To the hell, warrior!
Is Splatter suitable for art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn bridges old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
Which audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he filmed “Walhalla Rising”?
A captive Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torters and rows his opponents with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabiest killing methods and tears his enemies out of the body when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, does not say a word about the whole film, and the other characters can also be drawn to a maximum of one or two sentences or a few tormenting death screams.
Otherwise, silence will be silenced in Scotland’s terrifyingly beautiful hill landscape, which offers the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
If a film has multiple audiences, it is a pity that they exclude each other.
Since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutality to the Arthouse.
Most art cinema lovers are likely to be scared by the surrounding brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when Einauge, for free interpretable reasons, embarks on a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries and catches an eternity in flute and fog before the crew appears to arrive in America and keep silent there.
No wonder, therefore, that "Walhalla Rising" did not find a cinema rental in Germany and now only appeared on DVD.
This is a pity especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody facade is hidden a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that has deserved some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot, it’s all about atmosphere, a filmed fever dream.
There is no escape for the viewer.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly shakes his throat with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the unimaginable hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy who stands faithfully by his side retains something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who for enemies and temporary allies will eventually become a warrior from hell, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but only for those already corrupted.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious movie that you can hate and admire, to upset, upset and astonish.
and an experience.
Mysterious Earthwork
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a position on this – it still allows for controls.
At midnight from September 5 to 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attack a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name appears in the documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with North Korea’s help in the Quader, hidden in a valley that goes away from the current.
According to a briefing by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Agency (CIA) in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, was well suited to produce plutonium – from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, on the other hand, the technology of the fifties is hardly useful.
The CIA conducted a video presentation featuring blurred satellite images.
Through computer animation, it blinded where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which is a shrunk copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also submitted photos showing the building from close proximity or even the interior.
The reactor wasly in operation shortly before it was put into operation, but was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is hardly more known than then, yes, the mysteries have grown rather bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that while the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, it saw little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a “presumed reactor,” even though they consider the CIA presentation “plausible.”
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how sure he is to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat in the summer replied only lapidar that the IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions."
The destruction of the alleged “unexploited military building” was quickly overturned by the Syrians and the site was thoroughly planned.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers from the time immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client – Israel – bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always argued that it has never run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, this was rejected by the IAEA after analyzing the particles as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss this, as has been the case with the satellite images.
In addition, it denies the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
Israel is silent as well.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently reaffirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been delayed without results since June 2008 and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the space over which the IAEA watches.
As a key to advances in intelligence, the IAEA appears to see three other facilities that are supposed to be "functionally connected" with the alleged reactor - and other than this one still exists.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed what plants are, or what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to South German newspaper information, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these sites and on satellite images found a building complex near Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or right next to a military base – precisely for this reason Syria denies the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition – that the IAEA would be sent by the US to scan out military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip of the U.S. intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three locations and the Euphrates Quader.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be “related to fuel production.”
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities," i.e. uranium enrichment or recycling; processes necessary to build nuclear weapons.
The reactor is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should be cut from later on, there are plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could hold valuable traces, was stored in the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information about where the debris was left.
The al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria examined in 1998 for its suitability as a storage facility for radioactive garbage, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently associated them with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from the orbit show that Syria undertook groundwork at the three suspicious sites and removed large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be coincidence, but has hardly helped to clear the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - the effort alone shows the interest of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna had reassured even a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter has no high urgency, for example, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting in play for a few months so-called special inspections, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna Air Force has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of “an option for which I am open in the future,” but he does not hesitate.
There is a high risk in this path: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all but about to escalate.
On the other hand, as a diplomat has to think, “What if they find nothing at the end?”
Love in Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie began working on her still nameless film debut this summer, there have been troubles.
She wrote the script, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
You don’t know much more about it, but that’s enough for trouble.
There is persistent rumor that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, after which some scheduled shootings in Sarajevo were briefly moved to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war wrote about the UN refugee agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now - Jolie is herself ambassador to the UN refugee agency.
She is not diplomatic – she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in rape camps, and Jolies attitude towards the victims tells her enough about the script.
Their organization has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as ambassador, according to the UN refugee agency.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which read her script, has granted a filming permit for Sarajevo after a while – it is not clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author herself claims that she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give all parties involved a voice.
However, the content remains vague.
So a second synopsis of the film is circulating on the net, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the outbreak of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp, where he works as a guard.
What sounds significantly different than the variant of "rape victim becomes a torture slave".
That Jolie’s movie actually begins before the war – that’s all.
Jolie said the pressure on her was “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now you can only bring peace to the hackers of Hollywood: by putting the script, like so many before, illegally online.
Nothing like leaving here
This week, the Irish are back again.
No trace of sadness.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
The fans cheer of joy at crawling loud music, they stumble with their feet.
The Bailey pub in Southern Cork blows as players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance into beer cups - and hit.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there is 500 Euro winning prize plus airline tickets to Las Vegas for the Beer Pong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this scary drinking game and the restrained computer scientist that doesn’t really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself, distracting himself from the burgeoning question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not for gambling fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct application talks in New Zealand in January.
“I have a bad feeling about it,” he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still have no work there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had ruck, suck her desired job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: Like the Tanners, it looks like many families on the island.
More than 100,000 people are expected to leave Ireland in the near future, experts from the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they expect 200,000 immigrants.
This is a huge loss for the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
If the forecasts come true, there will be an emigration wave comparable to the one Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery that brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is now spreading again.
The economic crisis uncertains especially the young, well-educated Irish, for whom it has so far only gone up.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance.
Three out of ten men and women under 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times has a bunch of letters from young immigrants complaining: “Everything is going down the stream in Ireland.”
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers – but who can, go away and our country will lose a whole generation.”
“Please turn off the light.”
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future rising because the government is only doing eyewashing and no longer offering young people future prospects.
“They’re cutting the minimum wage, but they don’t have a strategy on how to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
She watches her fellow students hanging from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is that she will have to emigrate herself in four years.
“This thought is sad and depressing.”
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the topic positively.
McLarnon is organizing the “WorkingAbroadExpo”, a trade fair that offers a comprehensive service on work abroad.
“For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder,” says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something elsewhere, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are just setting up a fashion house.
In January, we will go to Hannover or Berlin for the next project.
O'Donovan rarely sees his home, as he makes extra layers to pay off the loan for his home.
“The situation is already a little crazy,” he says when he crosses the threshold of his home for the first time in a long time.
“I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I’m almost never.”
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through cool rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with wellined courtyards, large, expensive cars are parked in the entrances.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100% loan funded.
“There were crazy times, there was simple money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that it could go wrong with the loan?
O’Donovan thought for a while, poured hot tea and said, “I don’t have any children to feed and I’m young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again.”
The construction engineer doesn’t like the annoyance he’s often hearing right now.
“No one needs to starve – our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in earlier times here on the island,” he says.
“Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen – maybe it just makes us feel like Irish.”
He laughs and then tells about his father, who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back there and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Open up the future and just look at how life is going elsewhere.
He has a few years of work in London, and why shouldn’t it go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that worries him most these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could turn into a farewell party.
“Just not too many emotions,” he says, drinking a big slice of his beer.
“Goodbye, that sounds scary.”
"Let's rather call it a party, quite loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The democratic routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support for private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These findings came from the Latinobarometer survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are especially highlighted in this year’s survey of September and October.
The Good Mood in Latin America
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has grown sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of Democracy supporters has increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Also in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong recession last year, such a trend is visible.
But only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, lowering the regional average (see chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents stated that they are satisfied with the democratic practice of their country.This is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3).
Approximately 34% trust their country’s Congress and 45% their government. Both figures are the same as last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined efforts for more democracy.
That this continued during the global economic crisis may be due to the fact that Latin American countries experienced only a short period of recession and recovered rapidly.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and has fallen by 32% again this year.)
However, there are significant differences between countries (see diagram 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of the departing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread progressive thinking.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes increased, this is less the case.
It is only the second time since the start of the survey that many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as a bigger problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or a family member have been victims of a crime in the past year, but compared to 38% in the past year, the figures have dropped, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support for the private and market economies: approximately 71% of respondents across regions said that the private sector is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see chart 6).
Approximately 58% stated that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela haveined this view (and 80% are for a private sector), despite their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizing many private companies.
Brazil has the largest weight in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the U.S. as the most influential country, with this role being taken over by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A Electoral Trap
No one expected the November 28 elections in Haiti to be perfect.
But the facts far surpassed the fears of the voters who rushed to help the crushed country.
Overcrowded polling stations, multiple votes cast, ballots in the rocks, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
The polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom were homeless by the January earthquake, wandered around looking for a choice.
Some eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged top riders, demanded the cancellation of the election results due to alleged fraud.
There were violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "pretty good in many respects."
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, “these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show goes on.
The election agency, which is allegedly bound to the unpopular departing president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected election is scheduled for January.
There is hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no approval in the voters, declares the voting audience to be the winner of the vote, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, low voter participation was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were hindered from voting due to lack of organization.
Shortly before the election, about 250,000 passports needed for the election were not yet distributed.
A lot is at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following her husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%.
However, whether this will help her to re-elect next year will depend on whether the apparently mourning Cristina Fernández is more compromising than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led economic policy after his wife's election, often set up budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner’s death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further crashes.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (where one parliamentarian beat another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to discuss this,” said the president.
The 2010 budget now applies to the next year, giving the president even more opportunities to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but numerous private estimates – and labor unions’ wage demands – drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction as its main goals, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleansed the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently improved the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
She called on the private sector and trade union leaders to discuss.
And according to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth momentum by a major devaluation in 2002.
Per this is why Cristina Fernández wants to reconnect Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as is customary elsewhere.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in creating a new national consumer price index.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of her term, even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has mostly had enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy brought to them will be eaten.
If she wants to win another election, she must decide whether to silently and silently overturn many of her husband’s political decisions.
Weak Applause to China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the ocean?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of all eligible voters, rallied to vote for mayors and city councils in the five districts.
By establishing groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbolic figure in relations with the mainland.
He passed the exam, but only briefly.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not get a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocated a greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even entered the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with crashers, flag-swinging mass rallies, and dancers weakly dressed.
There was even the compulsory, mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of KMT, spoke to a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face, Lien was wounded and a standing spectator was killed.
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Independently, according to DPP leader Tsai Ing-wen, the attack disrupted the election and put the DPP in a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
China was probably the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, KMT does not like to focus on its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also avoided stirring up the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
It responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, on the other hand, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of drawing back Taiwan into the community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course, it also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
I would rather wait until the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was heavily weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was jailed for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under the rule of Taï, a new generation of moderate politicians has developed and the DPP is fighting for the voices of professionals and youth.
Tsai was widely supported as a DPP presidential candidate, as was Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
His party is now doing everything it can to show that it is also able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans to create an idea forge as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this requires unprejudiced discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that his party offers a “reliable alternative” to Mas’s accelerated approach to China.
Chen seems very upset by this change.
From his cell, he stated that the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan’s independence.
He even urged the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen’s intervention, the DPP has difficulty choosing its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas’s values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to conduct their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will transform his cabinet and local institutions.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only limited in favour of rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there is no return.”
Grammy Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding Surprisingly Awarded in the Newcomer of the Year Category
If you act at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony.Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since his album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination seems a bit unusual.But it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released no more than three albums before the release of the album, with which he became known to the general public.
Their ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is a step forward.And with her vibrant voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be calmly compared to Norah Jones in 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer comes closest to Spalding in this category of nomination.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer trio was nominated in the category of instrumental songs.
Its competitors include “Moody 4B” by experienced saxophonist James Moody and “Positootly” by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a smoking favourite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the Contemporary Jazz category, which otherwise has albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the big group category. He thus plays against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his Oktett, whose life album "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classics categories
The classics nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is listed by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestra work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with links to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classics nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Berg’s “Lulu” from the Royal Opera House Orchestra; Adolf Hasses “Marc Antonio e Cleopatra” by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariah’s “L’Amour de Loin” from the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins “The Enchanted Wanderer” from the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra and Choir; and Arthur Sullivan’s “Ivanhoe” from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales were nominated.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded on January 4 in the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is titled “Los Angeles” and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who sits in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinenkonzert" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with Orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer claimed to have written the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York City Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Dirigent Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral work for a recording of Strawinsky’s works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
Only women were nominated as vocal singers this year, including Anne Sofie of Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical crossover category, Sopranist Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula achieved the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often fierce public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
However, according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catch.
“The project is supported by many good people—Christians, Jews, Bahá’ís, and many others,” Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said on Thursday.
“As an American, it makes me proud.”
“It shows that there is justice.”
“There are few opponents,” he added.
“You’re just very loud.”
“Wonderful people live in this valley.”
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and the discussions for and against the building of the center lasted almost until midnight, with votes on both sides distributed fairly evenly, according to Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” he said.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
“America is over.”
Planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the site of the terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence.
His community of approximately 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a larger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer for water filter systems.
The new, approximately 2,300-square-meter Mediterranean-style mosque will have two minarets and will be about 13m high.
It will be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project in the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien bacterial species that can live from arsenic, among others, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible without the elements previously considered vital.
“This organism has two possibilities.”
It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow.
“That makes it something very special, even though it’s almost a kind of ‘foreign’ form of life,” said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online issue of the journal Science on Thursday.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in California’s Mono Lake grows even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“You wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life as scientists have to identify life and its forms, Anbar said.
The study examines microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were announced about the discovery, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report might be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery “shows that organisms in other planetary systems can trigger biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the ‘standard elements’ that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily fixed,” said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the UK.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in fundamental biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake due to its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically identical, she assumed that microbes exposed to both could potentially replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to its chemical similarity to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
“But the difference is so great that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus. it enters our biochemical system, where it smells almost everything,” Anbar explains.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to rising arsenic concentrations.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, the fact that it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than it did in the early Earth Age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simons research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Agency.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen outside a Bellflower motel were found, the Los Angeles County Sheriff said on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unknown people stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, officials said.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that the dogs are well,” says Whitmore.
“You are in good condition.”
“They were returned to their legitimate owners.”
Whitmore did not provide accurate details of the dogs' location or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
“The investigation is still ongoing.”
“We don’t want to say more about it,” Whitmore explains.
“We are following some traces.”
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They took their two dogs to a district pet home in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Representatives of the sheriff found the truck and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old rude, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog - were uninjured, according to authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, whom Rickard and Peek wanted to introduce this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, were missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city this weekend for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple’s a month-long tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their truck in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the truck because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard their car was stolen at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised a finder salary to anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder salary would be paid.
The Lion Cries Again After Court Approval for MGM Restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the "prepared" creditor plan to repay the $5 billion debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new films and TV shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so nothing is in the way to reboot MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to approximately 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not actually come into effect until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which contributes $75 million, is managing the company.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with an assignment to investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of the company, which struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year, to help solve its financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to solve MGM’s financial concerns and repay the studio’s more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
But the auction attracted a few biders and none wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started again when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October after months of debates and internal disputes.
If MGM officially survived bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month to run the company, will receive a “success bonus” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual plan of seven or eight films to be released in theaters in early 2012.
They are also planning two films after The Little Hobbit in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio will need a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who funded about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies led to no result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can break a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy dealers – one Wal-Mart, one Toys “R” Us, and one BJ’s Wholesale Club.
This year, the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, there is a broader offer on the most famous of its kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
More and more button-powered toys are coming to the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are plush figures, as big as sea pigs, who sing a note when you press on their belly.
Pressing once is equivalent to a note, by pressing multiple times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start pressing, you can’t stop again.
For a combination of messenger and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2 years old) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers exchange games like 'Simon Says', and thanks to the novel hanger feet with wheel blocking, it dominates the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device used Mickey as a dance teacher; however, their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you’re a child of the 80s, you’ll probably remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he’s back there (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children over 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaires that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with an improver with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to trust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog’s first major revision of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90 for children aged 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children over 8 years old).The five blocks are no larger than a barbed box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised letterboard competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go for the offer in the toy stores alone, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important ones.
For example, to give your child an online pet at Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match character package ($5 for children aged 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for two more parts.
This can be a rolling shoe or a puffle fabric.
The latest head-cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children over 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrant silicone legs in any direction.
It’s fun to send him through a messy garden.
And he holds up a lot.
Our fell from the kitchen table and even stayed in our dog’s mouth for a while.
Police operations in China are becoming milder
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked across a city square, examining his nervous subjects, giving orders with military authority and a dim voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan – China’s robust guard of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their inclination to violence – to impress viewers.
“Be ready!”
“Look straight!”
“Show them,” he whispered, “how beautiful girls are!”
Four girls, barely growing up to the teenage age, stood tight with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight row.
Four decent hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped slides.
“To me, they look average,” Mr. Tang remarked lowly.
“Models are beautiful.”
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
Guangdong province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green.
In Wuhan, central China, violence was replaced by low-stitching: in 2009, 50 officialsly circled an improperly arranged car and stared at the operator until he packed in and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have strengthened the city police strip. They have been selected special because of their appearance, good figure and youth.
They are meant to give the rough police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
It is right, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce city laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely shows a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei struck a spectator to death as he filmed her with his mobile phone while they were shooting down a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual from Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a handshake with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the internet shows Chinese trained officials in an attack on street merchants.
“Chengguan scares the government,” the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, following further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a “truly thorough cleaning.”
Skeptics consider this approach to be inadequate.
When the district searched for eight female recruits by ad in October, an editorial in Beijing Evening News raised the question of whether the women had real duties or should only serve as optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with a good figure and "harmonic facial traits".
They should be above average – over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
According to officials, the activity is physically too stressful for women over 25.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official told the quasi-governmental website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job first depends on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and “internal qualities.”
“Chengguan women are like flower vases,” he said, adding, “but besides, they have other duties.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district city administration, does not want to comment on this description,
But he acknowledged that in China, size standards in job ads are not unusual for both sexes.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this is equal to good appearance is controversial in China.
People with disabilities or physical disorders do not need to apply.
“Unfortunately, we can’t use any lashes or buckles here,” said Mr. Zheng.
“Your image would not be good.”
Liu Yi, who patrols on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple cups and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel as sexist that so much importance is placed on her appearance.
“Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?” she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague, 21 year old Xu Yang, commented, “We have the task of representing the image of the city.”
According to them, they don’t regret the short appointment as they have more ambitious career plans than just cuddling traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve street merchants who try to sell as many loaves and tofu dishes as possible on foot or bicycle before they are chased away.
“Mr. Wang, please leave here.”
“We’ve told you so many times!” explained Fr Xu to a merchant who had fled on foot while temporarily abandoning his noodle kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than exhausting.
“It’s almost the same every day,” explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in the leisure sector.
“All the routine.”
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate merchants’ goods, like their male counterparts.
You can only threaten offenders by reporting them to their male supervisor.
This is to protect them from public hostility, to which officials in China are often exposed.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of the Yunnan province, rallyed after rumors circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were shot down or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared from such violent outbreaks.
Unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square where female officials patrolled that morning, over 50 people gathered at a corner of the street.
Officials had seized a motorcycle, which was repaired against the regulations on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute hesitation, the officers turned their way to their vehicles with grim faces and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male band, left behind, turning his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators – men over 40 – play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
“Sometimes we go verbal.”
“Sometimes even physically,” explained Mr. Li soberly.
“Most of the time, people start with the fight.”
Prosecutor will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges raised against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to get her husband to lobby, Senator’s lawyers said on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most severe lawsuit against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada.Until the scandal, which caused headlines across the country and put a damper on his career, he was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign’s office announced, he was “very pleased” with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign’s lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign have been halted and that there are no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department; in their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, make lucrative orders to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a treasurer during an Ensigns election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work.According to documents and interrogations, after hiring, he took over Hampton's lobbying work for them.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to lobby his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the case, violated the so-called ban on the door-to-door lobbying.
According to the published indications, “it appears to be a deal and a violation of the rotating door statutes,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Justice Department officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the ministry appears to be very cautious in accepting political charges following a variety of defeats pursued by the media with great interest, including last year’s decision to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (an organization whose goal is to fight corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who has brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign’s chief advocate, said in an interview that he received a telephone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another on the following day that he was informed that the ministry would not file lawsuits against his clients.
Mr. Ensign’s defenders had cooperated with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, had “acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins refused to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had raised to prosecutors.
“I don’t feel comfortable going into the details of the conversation between the Justice Department and me, so much to say: we believe we have made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to halt the investigation over a separate lawsuit by the ethics group alleging a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated the federal electoral law.
The election commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that supported the Senator for a long time, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbying work thanks to Mr. Ensign’s help.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after the company passed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton in which he told him he was "calling" at the Department of Internal Affairs for a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also scheduled for lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after that Mr. Hampton had stopped lobbying.
When information about this affair first spread to the public last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth in the Republican rankings.
After not being noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign will no longer be the target of police investigations, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the Senator hopes the Ethics Commission will very quickly follow the example of the Justice Department and stop its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work at the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire calls attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them fled into the riots in the courtroom.
Within a minute, they posted their reports on horrific witness statements via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape trial and children chained to beds in a house that burned.
On Thursday, the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will officially end when the judge’s verdict on the death sentence issued by the jury falls.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have already filed lawsuits with grounds for appeal, which will be employed by the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process – including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – has resulted in a “circus atmosphere” and such widespread, immediate penetration of insurgent details that the jury has been inadmissibly influenced by public outrage.
This objection could cause the courts of appeal to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
“Just as I experienced it during this trial, I think it’s really a danger when the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects everyone’s right to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes’s chief advocate.
Chairman Judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court, briefly rejected the claims by decision last week, saying that the New Media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that was not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court judgments have found that reporting of notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland osteopath alleged to have killed his wife, saying in his decision that there would have been a “carnival atmosphere in the courtroom” due to the New Media.
Some believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Escape" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court rulings considering Mr. Hayes’s sentence half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication routes out of the courtroom, which were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of New Media in trials that are being followed by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said some appeal courts might be fascinated by the idea that limiting immediate communication out of the courtroom could make trials fairer.
The Twitter affair is just one of many that Mr. Hayes’ lawyers present to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been pre-condemned when Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them horrible photos of the scene of the crime during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, have filled them with disgust.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecutor’s office, and that he would have inadmissibly put pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, her arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a judgment appeal they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by candidates during the election campaign for the Governor’s office and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continually renewed the flames of emotions about the case.
“Such a day-to-day influx of media pressers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “has not been seen before in New Haven and even nationwide.”
Their focus on reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said the claim that these direct news are more encouraging than reports that are returned slower is a tech-hateful view that impedes reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said appeal courts would often be confronted with the argument that social and technical changes would need to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayer’s lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling that revoked the conviction of Dr. Sheppard due to reporting and made it clear that the New Media demanded new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Can courtesy unite the separating?
After a campaign of blasphemy and negativity, little courtesy broke out in Washington this week.
Is it the premise of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders did not bring a breakthrough in the major issues to be addressed during the so-called “lame duck session,” the session at the end of a term in which no decisions are made.
After all that is heard, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to rule, but rather an empty episode of a partial point-gathering.
The president’s deficit committee’s public meeting on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members.
It seems to be clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect, masking the ideological gap that continues to separate the members from each other.
This is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase – in which one requires from the other signs of cooperation and compromise, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a new party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s about taxes, donations, health care or welfare, the two sides are miles apart.
Lastly, in the November elections, Washington voted mildly, at least for a short time.
“No question, the tone has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official spokesman for the Bush administration who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
This is inevitable after the elections.
Elections arouse party passions that die away again.
And that is good.”
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the “lame duck session,” Republicans and Democrats have hardly any other choice but to find a solution.”
Bush’s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and nobody supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of them, whether temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, though only because Republicans cannot afford to believe favored tax cuts for the rich while refusing to support unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting in the White House, optimism has risen that one can agree on these issues during the “lame duck session” and at the same time also ratify the New START treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the urgent issues of the “lame duck session” doesn’t necessarily lead to permanent cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, even inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical — and this skepticism is shared by many — that courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today to 2012 as a pre-fight, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the creation of the new Republican majority in the White House and the Tea Party voters who served their formation.
No matter how concerned the Republican leaders are about playing too high poker, they know that they must try to keep their promises of cutting government spending and dismantling health care reform.
These partisan lines are already evident in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include a tax reform and the raising of some taxes as well as the raising of the retirement age and the reduction of government spending.
Vice Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own opinion, have pushed so hard to put the issue of deficit on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes in the commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are struggling to get close to that number.
The biggest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the panel, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little margin or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first struggle will take place next year in the form of party clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of state budget, taxes, and the health system, followed later by a phase of wider bilateral cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to an impasse, as it happened in 1995, then both sides must pay close attention to the public response.
Whoever is doomed to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Particularism and polarization are bigger today than they were in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a much more consistent 2012 election.
Thus, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
However, it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that still separate the two.
Leaked U.S. Document Portrays Moscow as Port of Corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it passes a portion of the bribery money and the protection money it collects on to the Kremlin.
Both the police and the State Security Service are blackmailing high protective funds so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical of authority” – is taking its share of the money that moves up the ladder.
The memo, sent to Washington on behalf of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on his homepage by WikiLeaks on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that he had been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous defamatory lawsuits against such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked for a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s dirty, it’s dirty.”
An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of the ambassador, individual persons are mentioned, and it is unheard of that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
“The direct connection of the Moscow government with crime has led some to call it “disturbed” and to conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocracy than a government,” the memo said.
Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals/mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection) extending across the police, state security (FSB), service supervision (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
“Luzhkov is at the top.”
“The FSB, the MVD and the militia are at the second stage.”
Finally, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors will follow at the lowest level.
“This is an incompetent system where criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city doesn’t offer any help.”
The report further states that the FSB is collecting money from the largest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source, it is said, "explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (and not from organized crime), because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as in demand as it was before."
The memo notes that while the collection of funds is comprehensive, the protection itself will not be very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don’t pay find their business closed very quickly – because of one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The embassy’s memo contains descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases that were presumably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, said in a recent interview.
“But he’s part of that bureaucracy.”
“It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia.”
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, Indem estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (country ranked from “lessly corrupt” to “most corrupt”).
The disclosure of the memo of the US embassy, which took place late in the evening after Moscow time, will surely trigger discontent within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be blamed for the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim to solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be fake and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
“But to be honest, we’t expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure, and in such unethical ways, you know.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a poorly illuminated, concrete classroom with dirty and flattering walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
“Everyone here loves Ta Mok.”
“He was a good leader and he took care of his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42, in a statement.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, known as “the slaughterhouse,” the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge fort in northwest Cambodia, where he has built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing followers in Anlong Veng are challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to publicly confront the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a UN-Cambodia community tribunal sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge for the first time when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, complicating their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
“It divides families.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died from illness, overwork or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and in 1979 the Pol Pot-Ied government was overthrown, the remains of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace treaty led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to run over to the government, leading to the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested by government forces near the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in a prison in Phnom Penh, where he was awaiting his trial.
When their supporters no longer protected them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the devastating poverty of rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
“These people benefited very little from the surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They are anchored in the regime’s utopian agricultural ideology.”
“They grew up without any professional knowledge.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought for Anlang Veng in the jungle before settling in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
“Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat.”
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court.
The task of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
That did little to ease the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who had been district leader in Manteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told officials at the Documentation Center of Cambodia that she had directed the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that allegedly killed thousands of forced laborers.
On a hot evening Im Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun threw long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court brought her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
“Cambodia lives in peace and stability,” she said.
“If there were no persecution, there would be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court prosecuted more suspects, despite experts and historians discussing this.
“Cambodia has to dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
“Reconciliation with Khmer times means gathering together the broken pieces,” he said.
"It's our duty to put these broken pieces together so as to understand everything."
The center created the first government-approved school book on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page “History of Democratic Cambodia.”
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the Ministry of Education’s High School History Book, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
“My family rejects many parts of the book and the court,” he said.
“They’re suspicious because they’re not sure how many people are being convicted by the court.”
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are gradually gaining influence,” he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Above in the Dangrek Mountains, a path overgrown with bushes and crushed with plastic garbage leads to a rectangle of black salt, covered with a rusty leaf roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a tire pile here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone seller on the street, said she didn’t know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot’s last resting place where she would lay a bush of ripe bananas – hoping it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to collect more armed uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure global nuclear materials, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to persuade Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium and seemed to have hit a barrier last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements were reached with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material—approximately £500, according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic.
The agreement appears to be one of the key outcomes of Obama’s April “Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations” that excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next 2012 summit.
“I was really excited that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012).”
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama vowed in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
During Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarus’ President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is basically armed, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... We will not make dirty bombs of it and we will not sell it to anyone.”
“We use it solely for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus, however, approached the United States a few months ago when it expressed interest in meeting an agreement.
The first attempt to remove Belarus’ uranium in October was complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded in a special train that ran more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust” that led to the agreement that Clinton signed, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy ministry spokesman working on global hazard reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Expanded Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the agreement, Belarus will dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, primarily due to Lukashenko’s harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggests a possible approximation.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantanamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
It is added that the former Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are being properly monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe accusing aid to human rights abuse practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American ambassadors Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Prime Minister admitted that the Council’s report “has hit Zapatero in the distance” and reiterated that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory.
"They just want to be informed" so as not to be "unpreparedly surprised," Aguirre reports via cable.
Former Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government “does not pay much attention to this matter, even though the government has little influence because it is in the hands of the judges.”
Prosecutor Vicente González, in his turn, in January 2007 told the embassy that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defense about the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any annoying or sensitive information," the ambassador said after talking to the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the U.S. was more concerned about “the apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors” than about the declassified information from the CNI and the Defense Ministry.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreet handling between governments,” Aguirre complains.
At a lunch in March 2007 attended by the U.S. ambassador and Spanish Interior Secretary Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that “although the Spanish judges are crazyly concerned about their independence and do what they think is appropriate,” he has instructed his staff to “avoid inflated rhetorical comments in order to get the tension off.”
The ambassador also expressed concern about the PP’s approach in this matter.
“Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt the fact that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as potential human rights violations, even if these disclosures could have a negative impact on the U.S. government,” he said.
The child murderer admits that she complained on the Internet about the "must" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she has held since childhood, sheins contact with a cousin and at least one girlfriend. Both are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña where she was born.
The reports are from 2008.
To understand them, one must know their love life, which the daily newspaper ABC reconstructed on the basis of witnesses from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she broke up her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his own, but his ex never let him do a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the labor market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him this, he felt good, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free to do and let what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address where I can send you the boy."
She complains, “If he doesn’t like that I leave the boy with my mother, I’ll pick him up when I get back.”
In May, she talks about returning to her village: “This week I’ll go there, but I’ll only stay there until the 19th, because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don’t want to lose it.”
She says she will take her firstborn with her when everything goes well.
"He will be where he must be, that is, with me.Never in life I will leave him with anyone but my mother," a questionable intention given their bad relationship.
There will be another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
“On the one hand, Caesar is satisfied, on the other, he is not.”
"On the one hand, he's with me and the place he likes a bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She talks about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for babysitting."
Day 17: Memories and Complaints.
“A huge kiss from Caesar asking me when you’re coming.”
"Alberto says he sent me any videos by email.You see, if he wants, he finds me, such a shit."
On the 30th, another one: "The boy is fine. he goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there’s one: “He’s shooting me money.”
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages about her.
She even had her own blog on MySpace, which is now blocked, and in which she called herself “Muki, the Prison Release.”
“Terror a la gallega”
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting supervisor, claims to have a bite of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can’t believe it all happened because she didn’t tell him that she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred from the Centre for Judicial Prisoners in Menorca to the provincial prison in Palma.
Defence lawyer Carlos Maceda said she could not remember the course of the incident, "and she had no intention of causing harm to the little one."
She had previously admitted that she had drowned César in the bathtub and placed his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecutor’s office requested a psychiatric assessment.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at parliamentary elections - preferred or not. their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party gets in these elections is usually twice as high as that in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, compared with only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend – the result of the redirection of the voting share of the PSC and the bonding of the electorate to the PP – continues, PP analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 MPs, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 MPs (out of 25).
These calculations prove the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People’s Party’s analysis, the ERC would lose one member – currently it has three – while the ICV could either keep its member or gain one.
However, if the electoral calendar isined, the next date will be in May 2011 with local elections. Even then, the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to the socialist domination, in four province capitals and with its majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists can neither gain a majority nor resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
Following the Republican debacle, it is not a mistake that this party will lose its representation in the city council of Barcelona, in which it would have to get 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its voting share in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the main role in Tarragon's shift. There they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP.
In Lérida, the PP is just 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros,ins good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met several times during the last election campaign.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People’s Party was able to see a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and strives to create lists in as many places as possible.
Catalan cell seized al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by the police officers of the Barcelona Police Intelligence Service formed the Thailand-controlled jihadist cell that supplied passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including the “Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam” (LTTE) and “Laschkar e-Taiba” (Let) – the latter was the author of the 2008 bombings in Bombay that killed 106 people.
The Spanish Interior Minister attaches great importance to these investigations, which go so far that he assures that with the “Operation Kampai” the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda has been “weakened” worldwide and “thus its capacity for action”.
The researchers estimate that in the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were counterfeited and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries without punishment.
The cell uncovered is not the only one in the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigative agencies, other European police units have also participated in the investigations. It is not to be ruled out that there will be similar attacks in the territory of the EU in the coming days to the one carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another operation was carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had led the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - stole tourist passports according to the regulations of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to carry visa stamps.
In investigative circles it is stressed that so far no links between the arrested in Catalonia and the Bombay attack have been found, although the author of this assassination, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipients of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently fake in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack in Catalonia, several thousand dollars were sent from a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command", which ended the lives of 106 people.
The police seized a large amount of documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone tax agreement
The Chairperson of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present Artur Mas her conditions in support of his entry into office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are not different from those already made during the election campaign and can be summarized with the priority of economic revival and the abandonment of regionalist adventures of independence, such as a financial balance agreement that the regionalist leader wants to propose at the height of his mandate.
The Chairperson of the Catalan People's Party addressed Artur Mas with certainty, given her by the 18 deputies she won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable.Because the candidate from the civic-regionalist CiU party is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining from voting at his inauguration.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to make in the upcoming congressional elections will depend on a possible entente with the PP.
As for the leader of the PPC, she demands that, in support of the entry into office, "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the Autonomous Region - similar to that in the Basque country - and that the party leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum, be employed.
It is common to both political leaders that they want to lessen the overwhelmed political apparatus of the regional administration and abolish the inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations for Mas’ entry into office are being dealt with by Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat on the part of the PPC.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The elderly care home reaffirms that deaths are not due to “lack of measures”
The owners of the old home in Olot do not rule out that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people
The officials of the caregiver La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, highlighting the damage caused to the institution by the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés – the caregiver who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible during his work.
The head of the elderly care home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, appeared in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to prosecute the responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability obliges us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a loss of social reputation because it did not detect the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had examined the deceased personally, but the formalities due to their age and diseases were handled by telephone.
The head of La Caritat denied this point roughly, stating that "missing measures could never have been the cause of the incidents."
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “there were no indications of negligent actions by a person other than the accused in the litigation.”
He confessed to 11 murders and claimed to have committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime, in which he had administered a mixture of different sedatives.
The head of La Caritat explained that the access of staff to the medicines is difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the sedative cocktail were used by the nurse in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will reveal whether Vila lies and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them from within by administering whitening loaves to them, as he confessed to have done to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, one does not believe the statement of the caregiver, not even in terms of the number of murders confessed, which could be quite more.This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available to justice for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
The European Central Bank (ECB) threats
Investors yesterday reacted sharply to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that “markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
The risks of the euro-peripheral countries have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks have risen by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be mistaken and that the euro has barely gained points, causing concern.
Yesterday’s events are typical of an illiquid market that recovers to the extent it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
Institutional investors will not lose their fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, after which tomorrow, for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future, the ECB will have to make a withdrawal.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to buy government debt as they were ineffective, as well as the abolition of all extraordinary temporary liquidity measures.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and quarterly bidding with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to maintain liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the program to continue to buy bonds and send a stronger signal.
If the expectations are not met, the excellent response of yesterday’s markets will be reversed, and if we insist firmly that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just like at the ECB meeting in May, where the bank reiterated not considering buying government bonds and the markets collapsed, this story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new market collapse.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year government bonds in Portugal was quite weak.
The state asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points across the entire curve, reflecting a change in perception of the markets, according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the debt gap figures of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been released.
The sum is estimated at approximately 10 billion in the short term and a potential further 15,000.There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognize the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures under the bailout plan are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must obtain parliamentary approval on its new budget next Tuesday, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland continues to be a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her speech more moderate in view of the summit of heads of state and government on December 14, where political unity is needed to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.
The Spanish Prime Minister presented yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the Autonomous Regions as well as in the financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalization, privatization and employment measures. measures that sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldis Four seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market rose by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets.
Compared to February, the response from the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and compelling, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect.That is why we are betting on a strong demand that will eliminate any doubts about our debt recovery ability.
For Spain, applying for a aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we do not need.The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar’s motto: “Now not only being counts, but also appearance.”
Only courage, we can do it!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen, at the request of his children, contested the shareholders’ meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not fade.
David Álvarez, founder of the corporate group, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers it "absolutely void".
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal action for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of the company group.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding does not seem to be willing to surrender in his legal dispute over the control of the El Enebro organs.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children who appointed themselves as members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders’ meeting held on 18 January this year, which has already been registered as contested in the Commercial Register.
The meeting of shareholders of El Enebro, convened by the Judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the midst of the Álvarez family.
The convocation of the judge to convene the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convocation of the meeting of shareholders.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a “desperate means of the applicants – his five children – to have the cancelled 18 January assembly recognized by means of legal excellence, fraudulent machinery and abuse of law,” officials explain.
This argument is the basis for subsequently challenging the assembly to declare it “absolutely void.”
The same protagonists, covering themselves in discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully in June to convene an assembly in court.
At El Enebro – asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets – David Álvarez’ seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group claims the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the case, which the judge must decide on in the hearing for the review of the appeal, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been shaped in this remarkable universe of speed of surprises and successes.
At first, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising record during the last seasons, at the final race last November, everybody wagered on Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari victory.
Without wanting to diminish the abilities of German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the “secret weapon” that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into the hands and thus created a winning team has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes not related to car racing.
This computer science program, called PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of Industry at Siemens, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 factory Red Bull can design and implement the changes and improvements seen in the races and tests "in a few hours, almost in real time."
Russwurm explains that in 1992, on the racing stations, there were an average of ten technicians who were able to introduce no more than three or four improvements in a season.
Today, Red Bull’s team employs 180 highly skilled young people using powerful computer systems to analyze and make all kinds of changes to the car.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull’s racing cars, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the simulator’s virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million a Formula 1 team can spend on racing in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially by journalists, are severely limited.
Everything that happens is top secret.
The staff consists of 580 people, including the two pilots, world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull’s true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the Energy Drink manufacturer puts in the service of its participation on the racing tracks, other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose fame is equal to zero, hide.
Steve Nevey, head of technology at the plant, emphasizes that five years ago, progress in R&D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computer because they “are unpredictable gladiators.”
HP to Open 20 Own Stores With Local Distributors in Two Years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a 20-storey sales network of 80 to 100 square meters each that the multi intends to open in Spain in the next two years.
The company has agreed to this initiative with the existing 16 multi-brand sales divisions, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP España Vice President Helena Herrero cited as an example the redesigned store at Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group intends to establish 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia).
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming new opening, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The vice president, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening a store is always the same.
The North American company group advises these and takes over the exclusive store equipment (with interactive products for touch).
HP is also responsible for the training of the store staff.
Helena Herrero said it is not a franchising system, highlighting that the exclusive sales network is intended to “optimize customer service and advice for small and micro during and after shopping, and even the packaging.”
The store in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service connects to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
“This system has been developed especially for small and micro enterprises as well as private customers, as the large companies already have their technical customer service contracts,” explained Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell plans to capture one million customers in three years
The executive board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers.He believes 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he predicts a drop in interest rates that banks are trying to offset by raising fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years – a branch still to exist.
Sabadell has found the way to spend the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without using the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers – 700,000 if you deduct the customers that the bank will lose – that is the big challenge this bank faces, because until now it has paid more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year, it has added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share among private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers make up more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase of productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction.The challenges faced by the bank will be presented together with the annual financial report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has disrupted all of the banks’ plans worldwide.
This year, Sabadell will complete its Optima guidance plan, set four years ago, which was originally planned for three years, but has been extended by one business year due to the market situation.
The customers who will leave the savings pockets are the main target of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola stressed 2011 would be a “difficult” year “with great reach”.
The manager believes that Spain will only "slowly" get out of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be “very difficult” to “create jobs” in two or three years – fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if it assumes that the war for liabilities – which punishes interest margins – will fade away, the risk surcharges that banks and savings funds have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity are already rolled off on the price of loans as a compensation for diminishing profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are of a structural nature and they will put pressure on loans."
"We haven't turned the cock away, but the interest rate differences are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued an order on Thursday to its branch network to limit the granting of long-term loans and to increase the interest rate differences (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also acknowledged that the banks were currently pursuing the strategy of "increasing the fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s guiding plan is based on organic growth, although the group, as always, does not rule out corporate.
Not for nothing he assures that in Spain “bigger companies are needed.”
“Everything will change next year,” he said.
He stresses that capital needs are currently “growing tremendously” and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red figures.
He believes that the FROB could replace the money market in case of capital increases.
After assuring that Sabadell could survive even a temporary shutdown of the markets, he defeats the argument of some bankers already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that nothing can be put into circulation, but unlike the events in June, short-term financing can be obtained through rebounds and thus catch up with the crisis.
CECA Excludes a Second Wave of Sparkass Fusion
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta dismissed yesterday the possibility of a wave of sparing funds merger and stressed the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish Sparkasse began, several Sparkasse insisted not to participate in the first phase.
On the other hand, the general director of the Spanish Savings Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, it was more about adjustments."
It may be that instead of seventeen we have thirteen or fourteen, but all the important processes have already been completed.
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta noted that the concentration process "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely expiration, which was set in earlier times, not now, as part of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically unparalleled process.The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which is what we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he noted.
Olavarrieta explained that "there would be a series of uninterrupted opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed nonsense and nonsense" because "Banco de España urges us to conclude on time before the end of the year."
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "maybe" in the whole world, adding that those who doubt this do this "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic context, we need to “not worry” about the situation of financial institutions and savings funds, which have undergone a “very significant” process of concentration, which will be carried out “as soon as possible”.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has chosen to keep the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has proposed new adjustment measures, ranging from tax cuts for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the abolition of the 426 euro aid for unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of the Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, Deputy Prime Minister Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How can these processes be understood?
It should be understood that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany is taking a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which collides with the preservation of the ancient traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the eurozone.
The second: the reintroduction of the German mark – although it sounds more like science fiction at the moment – is supported by a large proportion of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
This means: more macroeconomic control; strict fiscal management; punishment of countries that breach the regulations; possibly the suspension of payments of some countries, as well as the expansion of the cost of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been out for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent it from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of a discrepancy between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was put by the Central European country when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion were absolutely against saving Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes out again with a clear position, calling for a reform of the agreements of the European Union to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time to obligate private lenders to bear a part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European as it propelled the Irish crisis and everything that followed.
In the coming months, we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which is to enable these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures are to be taken now, the old way the euro works will no longer exist from that date.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which violating countries can be severely punished, forced to declare insolvency, and in which case the private sector must bear a part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we must take a tough growth course, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge gaps in the balance of payments, as it was cited by Spain in boom times, will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to 3 percent by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence passes into more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this, and his double announcement (the reforms promised after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not seem that anything would change.
Among the possibilities considered is that we would have to leave the eurozone, which has been completely stopped with few serious countries, cannot be ruled out.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sport and regulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to bypass a sanction.
The alleged exclusion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 game against Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being poured out on whether it was an unsporting act or not and whether both players should possibly be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is commonly known, the two players lost time a few minutes before playing (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls for the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed penalty at the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee penalized the club’s coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
Provoking a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos – the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the debate that has arisen over the case depicted is due to the fact that a team of the Real Madrid football club (who featured nobleness and honour in his anthem and other times punished his players for similar incidents) played the lead role, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this behavior not explicitly prohibited by the statutes is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a rule of law.
In this case, the damage caused to the sporting spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not jeopardized by these actions because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offending players from obtaining an unjustified benefit from the opposite.
The paradox of the plot of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand by misplay or rule error, because the circumvention of the rule was not done secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as striking as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and joyfully accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders drew from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasized here that the rival was neither put in a disadvantage nor were advantages for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It’s also not a useful strategy for the next game because the club will not have those players.
The advantage is obviously that players can start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
However, this is a long-term, to a certain extent uncertain advantage, as the team may eventually exit.In addition, players with this approach receive a penalty and move into the second card cycle, in which they exit with one card less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation.
It is not clear whether this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such approaches are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions to get the most out of the regulations.
In this case, the players did not want to bypass a penalty (that would actually be a clear case of rule failure), they preferred to choose when to undergo it.
They made a strategic decision without escaping a punishment or escaping it.
Although the boundary between invention and rule environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the controversy arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the type of rule transfer provoked.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer campaign to catch customers for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar has caused this year’s lava of reservations to fall on December 16 and 17.
The holidays paid by employees themselves are spreading; they do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas season, which provide oxygen to Barcelona’s restaurant and leisure business. But as a result of the economic crisis, they are launching a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which represents the large crowd: Almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the entrepreneurs and associations surveyed confirm.
To make accounting a bit more complicated, the calendar (New Year’s Eve falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13, resulting in a lava of reservations of dinners on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for budget reasons.
In order not to give up on this tradition, many workers pay for it from their own pockets.
Regardless of the economic situation, we are demanding low prices, confirms the chairman of the Barcelona Hospitality Board, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the Dachverband does not yet dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
“People think ten times before they make a reservation.”
“They like to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those "offer quality at good prices with good service," he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices at 25 euros are most in demand.
A survey in several central restaurants reveals that the evening of December 17 leads the providers to collapse.
The Soteras Group says demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom.The Group has adjusted its menus with full offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In another leading group, Andilana, whichins 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from early November.
"We have done the impossible to keep the prices of the previous year with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locations, optimism is not lost after revenues have flourished again since the second quarter and good, though concentrated on a few days, prospects for the Christmas business are facing.
Sources from the corporate group point out that even the 18th will be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
In addition to the six group menus, a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more as a price. It seems that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you can see green springs sprinkle, which is why the employees are invited again.
On the side of the Fecasarm association (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Recreation Association of Barcelona), Deputy Chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "living" overall, although the customers "pull out a maximum".
However, the fun of the celebration did not decrease, no matter who paid.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises concern in the United States
Islamabad is building nuclear weapons faster than any other country.
WikiLeaks reveals the relationship between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by the Internet portal WikiLeaks, confirms the enormous concerns of Washington about the Pakistani nuclear program.
On the brink of the clarifying and juicy details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, these reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not being strengthened, but, on the contrary, “diminishing,” and that the unstable Asian country is producing more nuclear weapons “at a faster rhythm than any other country.”
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – that the weapons are not assembled, but their parts are stored in order to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of a possible attack – prepares Washington for sleepless nights.
Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, listed the following risks: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the alleged dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer seen as exhausting and reason to be cautious, not only by the US but also by Russia.
"Pakistan must hire strictly faithful personnel to guard the nuclear facilities; due to the low educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who are involved in nuclear or missile programs," Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New on the documentary revealed by Julian Assange’s Internet portal is that the U.S.-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation is slowing down and the increased pace at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office describing the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" stated: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive answers to aid offers or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirmed that “despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country.”
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington, during a visit by the top army commander, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clear" the official that "the Pakistani army must stop its silent support for terrorist groups."
Search for WikiLeaks chief
Obama has appointed a senior anti-terrorist officer to prevent new disclosures.
Interpol has issued a red warning to the prosecution and finding of Assange.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a “red warning” to “discover and pursue” Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It is not new, it is from November 20.
It also has nothing to do with the recent disclosure of over four million US diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens’ lawyer said the police “will know where and how to contact Mr Assange.”
The order was issued by the international police authority based in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities received the authority.
The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and locate Assange, "to arrest him provisionally and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member countries, according to the organization, view the red warning as a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is allegedly staying.
The move outraged Assange’s lawyers, who published a letter yesterday informing them that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks is ready to answer questions from Swedish authorities via a videoconference.
They also recall that Assange requested to leave Sweden and received permission from the prosecutor, who is compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal prosecution," the letter said.
While the world is looking for him – and his mother from Australia claims her son’s innocence – Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silently.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an undetermined location, during which he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violating international agreements signed by the United States, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the resignation request as "ridiculous and absurd."
“I’m not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent new disclosures of documents.
President Barack Obama’s spokesman’s attempt to pay less attention to Assange contradicts the opinions of conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, has urged the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate their funds and pursue anyone who supports or contributes to them."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further and had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be “murdered.”
“Obama would have to turn it into a target disc and use an unmanned aircraft or something like that.”
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was that leaked information into the government, he is guilty of betrayal and everything that is not execution is his too mild punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a blink of eye to the Carod Nearby
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on his continuation in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to go out of the way for the tenth time of an internal riot in the ranks of the ERC, after losing 11 MPs and half the votes of the voters.
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the relatives of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not give him the same headbreaking as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra is trying to win the new critics with a blink of eye, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For the start, he announced yesterday that the over 200 regional council members of ERC could comment secretly on his remaining in office.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the carodists wanted to miss a penalty to the president, they could do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission under his person.
In several interviews he affirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without stating percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod relatives demand more from the president than just to make his office available to the party.An inadequate gesture since Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of Congress.
But as they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board of directors on a plan of action from now until May.
For this purpose, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which the management will submit to the Council for vote on the 18th.
In return, Puigcercós will promise to submit to Congress in the fall of 2011, which the party leader already considers a fact.
The Chairman of the ERC believes that the “polyphony” is damaging to stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the current Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for different goals".
He counted five, two of which are at the forefront.
First, the “restructuring” of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod’s environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally abandon the principle of full assembly as a way of functioning.
Thus, he advocates a reform of the statutes that would allow congresses to be held with elected delegates.
From the end of the full assembly model – an exception in the Spanish party system – Puigcercós’ team, which has already fought for it at the last two congresses, is as obsessed.
In fact, at the bustling assembly of 2008, the party leadership was commissioned to review the general assembly principle at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This deadline is still out, because due to the internal unrest of recent years, it was not advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors on the lookout, it might have been time to re-attack this matter and end it forever.

Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
Chinains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of China stated at COP16, his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and it will maintain its offer to cut 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He concluded that over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work with the international community on this issue.
He explained that China’s climate strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institutional building, and support for pilot programs.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year that includes targets for reducing gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he highlighted that in China, state authorities have worked with those of the central state and municipalities to the targets of energy saving, energy efficiency and emissions reduction.
In addition, he noted that several multiannual plans have already been initiated or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those received funding from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was introduced over the past five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private hands.
There is also a provincial-level project on climate change, another on replacing traditional bulbs with energy-saving bulbs, and another on mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, the government’s scientific adviser on climate change in that country, confirmed that China’s efforts are far greater than commonly thought.
He pointed out that per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States are 100 tons.
Energy efficiency has increased by twenty percent in the last five years and a further increase is expected by 2020, he explained.
Legal Exclusion of Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former chairman of the panist party has the right to turn to the National Order Commission and demand what the right would grant him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former party leader of the PAN has the right to turn to the National Order Commission and demand what the right would grant him.
In an interview before the appeal of Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espino was a decision made at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the order commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal in his case to the Commission de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be made by a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he explained, it is not time to think of 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidate has never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge from the internal vote on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now.It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he concluded.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so “internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, “we enjoy it and it strengthens us,” he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the one or the best chairman that Acción Nacional would need for the next three years.
“I’m quite unconcerned and open, I’d be proud to delegate the post of party chairman to each of the five.”
He predicted that the party’s recovery recorded at the last July 4 election will be reflected in the next election, although “it’s not time to think about 2012.”
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he highlighted that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa carry the flags and would be observed throughout the country.
When questioned about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his discourse course during his four-year government, César Nava urged PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year term of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, should they start defending them, should they finally get out of the closet," he reiterated.
He is of the opinion that the owner of the federal government expressions like those he could make in his discourse at the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no mouth ban and even less censorship.
Obama promotes law for undocumented students on Twitter
"If you are in favour of passing the Dream Act, then call your senators and urge the passing of this law," Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - the law to legalize undocumented students with a post on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you’re in favour of passing the Dream Act, then call your senators and urge them to pass this law,” Obama tweeted.
His short message contains a cyberlink to a broader document urging the public to contact their senators as the vote of the law is imminent.
“With your voice we’re waiting for, it’s time to listen to you,” he said.
The news spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block any vote in favour of any law except the expansion of the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding would be expanded.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he believes that once the tax issue is solved, a timetable for the remaining projects can be set.
“I think we still have a lot of time...”
“We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year.”
"I believe we can reach an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the course of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Chairman Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would "apply for a vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law that allows the initiative to legalize undocumented students to be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, though next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the Law of the American Dream, would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, while living in that country for the last five years and being enrolled in a higher education institution or the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
That’s why the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most controversial Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they have stated that they will no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had voiced in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet defined his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Put your finger in the wound
The second round of 'The Lust in the Language' was a walk in which the participants made a strong effort for the storytelling
"I understand that with sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event, the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... “brings us into trouble,” the Argentine writer spit sweetly to the audience, composed mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then labeled Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a " wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not receive any answers, but clues for the guidance of her story.
She leaves the infectologists convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath in the middle of the hallway, but who explained to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalytic reveals the secret: "the wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative whispers relieved and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that this is really open and does not exist".
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative he called "Praise of the Invention," and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With references to magical realism, he tells of a famous witch who touched the clouds, brought back far-travelled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative made a turn and America, the great novel that did not lack its own chronicles from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the deceived witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with imagination that even lost the sense of shame."
However, he emphasizes, "it is the madmen and liars who best imagine things," and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side of the narrative belongs, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
He actually calls it the “Cervantes tradition.”
"We have inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was in turn, the writer commented and praised the diversity of interpretations to which the FIL’s invitation to the Round Table “The Finger in the Wound” had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that afflicts her country – like all of Latin America – as a result of the fight for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not deliberately planned engagement," she explained after emphasizing that literature is communication and bondage that builds up between the author and the readers like a "chemical reaction."
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also “hopped that finger of the devoted writer in the writer’s wound.”
He noted that in a fast-moving world, intellectual habits and control of consciousness also result in dogmatism, forgetting “that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes.”
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuance means often to put a finger in the wound and harass those who feel much more comfortable thinking in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in pre-fabricated ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white he noted and invited to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Ronaldo is fighting for his first title.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three final defeats, he has experienced up and abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the final match between Santos Laguna and Monterrey, they also face two different styles, defined by their respective coaches, and their contradictory encounter is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he has experienced up and abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has held well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has played up with the medal to the second champion, he is one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The santist strategist reached the first final as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the spikes in hand, with which he experienced a major defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna in the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to make a rebound, as the match with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went undetermined after 210 minutes of play, but at the elfmeter he came forward with 3-1 and got two opportunities to insert his title, but ultimately three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he doesn’t want to be pursued again by misfortune and get rid of the evil spell to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he reaffirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, that's why the title will come to me, but what happens first is the most important thing," he said.
“The only lesson we can learn from this is that until the referee tosses the end, we can’t celebrate, we’re ready on the line, the players too, because the last time we were already prepared to go out with two elephants, and I think that’s a lesson until the game is over, there’s no reason to celebrate.”
Knowing that this series could be decided by elf shooting doesn’t bother him, because he trusts his players: “You never want to arrive at elf shooting, you want to finish in the regular time, but sometimes there’s no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tournament we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the fierce effort to hold the title already in our hands, which left us something for this final game, and we hope it won’t come this time.”
It is in Romanso’s power not to be just a second champion anymore and to enjoy the fame that titles bring for the first time.
The US changes the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves with the visa application services before their interview at the consulate; costs will be reduced waiting times.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants will have to present themselves with the Visa Application Services (ASCs, the first letters in English) before their interview at the consulate.
The ASC staff will record the applicant’s biometric data, which will be verified by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will decrease, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately for the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service using which the document is issued.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary employees) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not need to have an interview at the consulate, they only need to present themselves at the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
As the biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the interview at the consulate will stay there less time than before.
Those applying for the visa at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the service fee of $26.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found at the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA Announces Discovery of Alien Life
The North American Space Agency has convened a press conference to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living creatures in space.
The National Aerospace Agency (NASA) of the United States announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented at a press conference at NASA’s headquarters in Washington tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, a science that examines the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
At the press conference, NASA assured that it would present “a supervisory finding for the search for extraterrestrial life,” sparking speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments that were previously considered uninhabitable, human-like creatures could exist.The hypothesis was raised that these could transform into intelligent beings – like humans – if their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where she lives in an environment that has been thought to be too poisonous for all imaginable life forms because the lake is highly arsenic.
Somehow, the microbe uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account increases the chances that there might be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that "there is actually a different form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the actual range of its fund tomorrow, Thursday, at a press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is exploring the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest moon), questioning whether its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the Law on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th parliamentary term had just begun, and an opposition bloc, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, had already established itself, presenting himself as an independent.
Prior to the opening session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the Organ Act, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a “double-party system” would be introduced, for now it would be two persons, the same number of parties controlling Congress.
These four MEPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the board headed by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as Deputy Chairmen.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the parties PRI and PAN have institutionally introduced their political position with these reforms.
He pointed out that in the coming days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. In doing so, they assumed the political will and if they did not have it, they would be subjugated by both parties again, ending the opposition coalition.
“That’s where I get (the opposition coalition), that’s what I see, because we’re being excluded from all decisions that don’t even take into account the opinions of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there would be agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be permitted, he continued, that Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be “duopolistic.”
“It is not the spirit of legislative reform that a perpetual two-party system should reign in Congress.”
"For the start, this group starts with five MEPs and they are talking to other colleagues so that they become more," the Convergencia member explained.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, citing PAN and PRI, argued that Congress has now turned into a “beat” for two.
“Before it was just one party, now they divide it into two.”
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the MEPs and give them their seat at the negotiating tables.
The five, currently seen as divided into different factions, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform, which was carried out and agreed upon by the others, we have stayed outside and we disagree with this reform."
200,000 pesos more for “the supplier”
The municipality of Mazatlán pays another check to the contested owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check of just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the amount paid in the second half of the year to the owner of the company for electrical equipment is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this check, issued for a sum of 200.144,56 pesos, with the number 9258447, was issued on November 16 with the purpose of "Calculation of Open Accounts".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money would go from the community to this supplier.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount you still owe her and consequently the number of checks still issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"There was nothing bought from her, it's just the debt being paid, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two from October 15, October 19, October 29 and the last from November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal as required by law, if a company is questioned by the ASE to avoid other administrations requesting their services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste published on 25 July the audit of the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was that already before, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also deals with Jumapam, where she collected checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist areas need to be improved
Tourism companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist as a result of the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist into the break-in of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán requested the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and throw a bad image of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Trade Association of the Zona Dorada, recalled that on different occasions it was demanded to nurture the destination and turn the poor conditions tourists encounter into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor state of the streets and walkways would have had a negative impact as tourists would come to wander and see the mess, after which they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to have to shut down a business one day, and they don’t care how much money you’re losing because otherwise they’t do the construction work so slowly and unplannedly.”
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist would have highlighted the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance work by the city.
“The community must assume its responsibility and prevent such a thing from happening again. how should it do that? well, through preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in retrospect,” he explained.
“We are eager to have a clean city because not only does it have to beined because it is a tourist area, but we residents also have a right to a clean habitat.
"There are other places that also look untreated and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists.It needs to be a good product to be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly on fire," he added.
“These arrangements have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents are just what is obvious to everyone: Maintenance is urgently needed.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, Deputy Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist sites of Mazatlán because they would not be properly used and created a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the fore along with the city. Making the city clean, orderly and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
“Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that would first need to be cleaned up and cleaned up in order to make them attractive for tourism and bring them to the inventory we use to promote this destination.
IP demands results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should assume the great responsibility of giving a model for a better Sinaloa facing many challenges.
Mazatlán’s corporate sector demands a decent parliament, free from negotiations between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces big problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 MPs from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of party and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Entrepreneurial Coordination Council, suggested that the new MEPs should assume the great responsibility of giving a model for a better Sinaloa facing many challenges.
“We hope that MEPs will truly exercise their right to act freely from agreements between parties, because it is common for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thus turning them into carnival parades of the rulers and the leaders of parliamentary factions.”
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
“We take care that they do a trustworthy job and are committed above all to society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their trust to them in the last election.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, Chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 people’s representatives is to drive and work together for the country’s economic growth, because today’s economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they will drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will somehow boost job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MPs to allocate the necessary place in the state budget to the Ministry of Tourism in order to promote.
This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
Funding must be allocated to tourism projects, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King is Seeking
Puppies, cars, bicycles and other toys are eagerly desired by the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
It will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes on the next day of the Triune, because the household consists of no more and no less than twelve persons and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende.
“Sometimes it’s hard because my husband doesn’t have a job, but we sell mandarines and potatoes... In the afternoon, I go out to the streets with the farmers to sell,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has wanted to have a 'monster car' for some time now, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothes in the size for a one-year-old.
“(José Alfredo) said to me, ‘I would like this monster so much,’ but I replied, ‘Let’s wait, boy,’ because it was very expensive,” Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size of 12; the ten-year-old Isaías has the size of 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has the size of 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the 'Holy King is sought' campaign by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie as part of the crushing of a production and sales network of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were said to have served mainly in drug manufacturing.
"Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment used for the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec security police.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom are considered to be the main conductors of the drug ring, from Sherbrooke.
The detainees appeared in front of the courthouse in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest.
They could be charged, among other things, with the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale, conspiracy, and the service of crimes.
These home searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that lasted over a year.
"The information obtained from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," Ruel said.
Around 70 police officers from the regional investigation unit Estrien of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Authority had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could be easily tracked
The conservative bill, which, according to the government, is aimed at regulating the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, is likely to be stamped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they can’t endorse the proposal.
“I strongly oppose this Charter.”
“I stand with a party that has put bonds on your feet,” said Michael Ignatieff, the leader of the Liberal Party, after the weekly Caucus session before the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows anyone coming from a sea ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, violates the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," Duceppe said.
The criticism of Olivia Chow’s immigration issue, NDP, has pointed out the critics who claim her party did not behave steadfastly enough toward the covert immigrants.
“The Neo-Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is exactly what we are trying to enforce by mediating another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
We do not support the conservative bill because it seeks to blame the refugees and holds children trapped for at least a year," Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The Canadians are insistently telling MEPs that they do not tolerate this type of covert immigration, these criminal operations that affect Canada and that treat the country like a pedestrian.”
“They expect Canada to take harsh measures,” said Minister Kenney.
“The government has not announced any vote of confidence on its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
One conservative, however, told QMI that the government would convene a vote so that any opponent MP would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The unity does not find unanimity.
Despite Jean Charest’s announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing anti-corruption and collusion unit, numerous observers continue to call for the establishment of a public investigation committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Nor did Stéphane Bergeron, a critic and member of the Québécois Party, qualify this announcement in terms of public safety as “a rabbit drawn out of the hat” and “a solution made right at the end of a table.”
Minister Dutil, in turn, turned to those who fear that political power would have too much influence on the unity in question in the future.
“You’ll see the result when we announce it,” he contented himself to confirm.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace conducting a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this investigative committee, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide," he explained.
“The only means of forming an investigative committee is the resignation of Jean Charest,” said Yves Boisvert, a lecturer in ethics and policy systems at the ENA.
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposes that Quebec give the Financial Audit Authority a special mandate to investigate corruption and secret deals.
“One should be able to extend the mandate of the audit control,” he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspectorate the same power as commissioners, which would also allow it to compel people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the boxes of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend its criminal code in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This request comes from the chief prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Secretary of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague from the Justice Department, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain novelties relating to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which affected the groups of motorcycle police officers, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal code had not been revised.
As a result, Ottawa enforced the anti-gangster law.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several river streams are still under strict surveillance due to the heavy rainfall that has erupted in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, a landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two homes were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another earthquake occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, heavy rainfall ranging from 40 to 70 milliliters of rainfall has spilled on several regions.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rainfall were expected here by Thursday evening, depending on the regions.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
In total, up to 100 millimeters of rainfall have fallen.
Since snow melting, which has already accumulated in certain sub-regions, is to be added to these precipitations, the crossing of several streams is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the flood warning concerning the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the Lanaudiere region.
The river courses in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian Mountains, and the Chêne in Lotbinière are now subject to flood surveillance here and continue to be monitored.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an evacuation bridge was broken down due to heavy rains.
Ten homes had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, according to security adviser Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec State Water Centre, in turn, issued warnings on Wednesday of the sharp rise of several rivers, notably of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont is partially justified
Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial reversal before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) due to his controversial statements about social welfare and Haitians as well as his flawed talk on radio.
The CCNR believes that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to express their own opinions, but that certain statements would have "contained extensive information on social welfare and unjustified negative representations of Haitians, as well as such a disguised speech that is not appropriate to the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion about suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two people who committed suicide violates the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first order was filed following a complaint from the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organization complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators should provide solid information rather than misleading information.
Regarding the topic of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont held that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the supervisory board members had concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
“The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the disputed consequences of ‘Dupont le Midi’ would have addressed a sensitive topic in a family-friendly and appropriate way.”
Therefore, he was not demonstrated in any way against his person.
The last controversial point was the statements referring to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had a media-effective discussion on this subject that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated that he had not donated to Haiti’s aid because it was not certain whether those in need would actually receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not of an abusive nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of Haitians.
"I have already served my three-day suspension in this case."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the moderator explained.
In all its decisions, the Supervisory Board objects to the spread of an unspeakable expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted “beyond its obligations”.
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, inter alia, had to communicate its decisions once during the main end time within a period of three days, are insignificant.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal’s Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, brilliant in "Sanda" (Full Contact Kung-Fu), kickboxing and Thai boxing, is now rising to the Tatami and the boxing rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started fighting sports like kung fu and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago," Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008, explained to further develop among the professionals.
I personally look for fighting everywhere, as for those who don’t like ground fighting, as presented by the mixed martial arts, competitions in North America are rare.”
Recently, a security officer working under his sign and a UPS employee had given bad news to his rival when he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the Amateur World Championship in Edinburgh, Scotland, between 23 and 30 October.
"I have won in the categories of full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
“I’m currently preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China.”
"Those fighters from each category who had placed themselves among the top four at the last World Cup were invited."
I got the Bronze in Toronto in 2009.
“I went to Vietnam in 2005.
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while I finished third in 2009 in Toronto," he added.
"It's worth mentioning that I've made progress in every race."
"With this rhythm, I will be the first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, in which thumbs and footheads as well as ground throws are permitted.
The duels usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer who has emerged from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
Should Nacer Zemmal retain only one event in his career, he would call his presence here at the super-tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest ranking and the most respected in China," the sympathetic pound man explained.
"It's a bit like the equivalent to Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
“It was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) before then losing in the final.
“The one who defeated me was a real professional,” he said.
There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg).
"The winners of the semi-finals each meet in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer their faces to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant project planning firms $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts stands a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, for a sum of $295 million without tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as an accompanying phenomenon of Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over its responsibility to the private sector for this important, $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Québécois party, the recourse to corporate consortia represents a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of competition distortion and price increases.
"This is a new way of playing off-the-top and outsourcing the competition."
"That means that instead of shortened games, instead of in secret, it is now conducted in an open form," Sylvain Simard, MP of the PQ, told the press conference yesterday.
Early in the morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult for him to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon by vehemently denying that this contract was a shortened game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she stressed, stressing that the PQ acted "unfairly" and that "it lacks toughness."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium model is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity in terms of the scope of its work.
The construction process is underway and is expected to be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without a competitive battle; negotiations had already taken place.
Furthermore, the Quebec consortium model is no longer an exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of civil engineering and consultancy is the subject of government investigations.
A brief overflying of the Quebec Enterprise Register allows us to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanent.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, leads to the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
Regarding the "Energie gérance" consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the Baie James territory is subject to a special workforce dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has taken this fact into account in a special way since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has shaken the nose over the fact that the contract for project management was granted by agreement.
"If you make an auction and there are few applicants, your prices will rise quickly."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this March and tell yourself that they will negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte reiterated.
This contract, granted to the Consortium "Énergie gérance", is part of a long list of contracts covering more than $50,000 received from the Québécois party.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, Le Devoir listed more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts approved by companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had signed 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not counting their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these agreements have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had said that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are well known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had suggested that the PQ was equally connected with the companies it “funded” before clarifying that they were their executives.
Barometer of Responsible Consumption - The "green" label is not trustworthy
Greener, but uncompromisingly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but neither in the labelled brands or the eco-label that should guide their choice.
It is a shame, though it is bathing in a media-impact universe where it is flooding with information in favor of a more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has to complain about a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that is recognizable as a brake to its commitment, as the first reading held yesterday showed.
Despite driving the consumption of so-called social-compatible products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to give little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebecers admit that they don’t really believe in the company’s environmental commitment as much as they do in green corporate advertising, according to the measurement tool developed by the responsible consumer center of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates attached to the allegedly fair products, but also the reliability of the products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
Information on responsible consumption, however, seems important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently supported by one-third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the emptiness and questionable nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
Moreover, one-third of Quebecers are suspicious of the declared performance of the green products and services that are being put into their hands.
According to another report, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their beliefs.
According to the Barometer, they also preferred 61% of purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its footprints left in the environment by caring for animal welfare.
But social and environmental awareness still seems to be stopping their car, according to the barometer: only 28% of Quebecers stated that in 2010 they used public transportation or preferred the car center to demonstrate their interest in the environment.
Running and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the clichés.
State bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to contribute financially to the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The development company Angus and Parallèle, which had hoped for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to acquire the Daniel Langlois-owned cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to restore it to its actual cinematic function, apparently did not get what they demanded.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond lower than originally hoped that could bring about a viable solution under favorable conditions, at least according to sources drawn from the state rumor.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the petition has since again been summarically corrected downwards.
A proposal together with an action plan have already been sent by the President of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to the Minister of St-Pierre, who leads the Act eXcentris.
A few days ago, he gave her a final report.
However, the Cabinet’s counterproposal was submitted to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until December 31 to reply.
In any case, the premise of state donation seems to have been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec association of owners of the cinemas and complexes opposed a direct government investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture did not provide financial assistance for real estate projects there, which he did not send to other cinemas.
In contrast, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial, economic aid.
After the self-funded construction of the cinema, director Daniel Langlois had presented the authors’ cinema in the premises of his cinema complex under great difficulties for over ten years, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the State Treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to keep its clients on the bar.
Société Angus, along with Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are running a private-funded campaign that they hoped to raise $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinemas on February 27 next year with the premiere of Xavier Beauvoir’s very successful film “Des hommes et des dieux”.
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not recalled the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the downward corrected proposals that have been made to them.
The Mystery of the Complex Shaken Canada
The new U.S. diplomatic lines spread through WikiLeaks reveal the secret of what the United Nations considers as the Canadians’ inferiority complex toward the Americans, but they also reveal the latter’s sense of superiority toward Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voter does not have the Canadian-American relations in mind when voting, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the Conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly disclosed yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantial content to be knotted on.
A link dated September 22, 2008, that is, during the full run of the federal election campaign, reports on the point from which the United Nations ceases to participate in the actions discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the U.S. ambassador in Ottawa.
Mr. Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
“A near-inherent Canadian inferiority complex conditionally may cause Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday domestic disputes much more likely than the United States to push the Black Peter in this election (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign),” he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus “the proverbial Goliath of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to speak of.”
The ambassador understands this “destroying silence” all the less as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
“Logically,” he said, “it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in the election process.”
The other expression of this sense of importance is the communication sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a business operator in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Their trip will help ensure the government’s survival in the confidence vote on the federal budget in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade as a result of a $30 to $40 billion revitalization program,” describes Breese.
He had not mentioned anywhere that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the collapse of the parliament by the coalition and the conditional survival of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed revitalization program.
Another statement, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast on CBC is spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can watch little subtle references to Maher Arar, the “No-Fly-List” or even removals for the purpose of interrogations conducted by CIA muscle protests.
Another statement details how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was ready to accept certain Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner is said to have answered the question by yes, but on the basis of an individual "case by case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described, “has handed over to the Secretary of State a paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.”
“The Secretary of State has promised to re-examine the file.”
Finally, let’s note that the feelings about the WikiLeaks website are heating up.
Tom Flanagan, an old and very close adviser to Stephen Harper, had told CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be “killed.”
He referred to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday, the UN in Cancun proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs) equivalent to one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its place in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compulsory reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of CFCs released to the earth due to lighting would be avoided if the white-glowing bulbs, which are still a 50-70% monopoly on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better, LEDs.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the world’s vehicle fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 to 49 Gt.
However, 5Gt would have to be deducted from this balance sheet to stabilize the climate rise by 2 degrees Celsius from now until 2020 to prevent it from falling out of control.
In the white-glowing pearls, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced even more than twice.
Compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips launched this week – this company has, by the way, participated in the UN study – have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-glowing bulb, giving a hint of the savings opportunities of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that iese completely new bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
They do not contain mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and must therefore be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless the manufacturers provide a reception point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulbs, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit significantly more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-glowing bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report outlines in detail the gains that each country would generate thanks to this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion annually on electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, which is equivalent to 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia $2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast is looking forward to announcing election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential elections immediately after their deadline has expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent election commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
“He calls on all parties and institutions in Côte d’Ivoire to prove their responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the preliminary results are announced.”
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the election commission had delayed the deadline, set for Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue its work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, numerous calls from all over the world have risen, the CEI may finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the departing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which were achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N’Guessan, leader of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN’s exercises to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president’s supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the lawsuits filed by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo contractors are now more of a belief that the country’s Supreme Court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a politically close affiliate with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who denies any connection to the former rebels, has rated the delay in announcing the election results as “unacceptable” and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even though he has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies reiterate that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and filing a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the election commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of Sunday’s presidential elections were held to crown the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been split into two over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held responsible in the event of possible riots.
Laurent Gbagbo won the first round of elections on October 31 with 38% of the votes against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France remains stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is at a stable 9.3% (including overseas departments at 9.7%) according to the International Labour Office (IAA), according to the preliminary, seasonal data released on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is established at 2,631 million.
The second quarter data amounted to 9.3% of the employable population in the metropolis and 9.7% with overseas departments included.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
More in depth, 3.4 million working people in the French metropolis were unemployed in the third quarter but wanted to find a job, including whether or not they were employable every two weeks or whether or not they were job seekers.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points seen over the year) and 25% including overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The seniors, in turn, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of the people over the age of 50, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year olds were able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France overall.
After a dispute over its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published its monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) from 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Region of Bouches-du-Rhône (PS), was investigated and transferred to a prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into public and fraud suspicious markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with bribery of corporate assets, misappropriation of public goods, healing, complicity in corruption, unlawful bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is fight-ready and intends to comment on any questions that the prosecutor's office will ask him, instead of spreading brainstorming."
"It's easy to submit a series of criminal charges to him, another thing is to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had insisted that a memorandum for his justification be submitted to the judge before his hearing through his lawyers.
A family member of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and jailed on Wednesday night.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything but keep his landfill he had to manage running.
Regarding the business competence or the destination of the associated funds, he would never have known, Simon says.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, a former general director of the public service of the Aubagne area, was also charged with bribery and complicity on Wednesday, but was then released under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these legal acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations on the facts he was accused of."
"The chief prosecutor has considered not to deprive him of his liberty," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released from custody in the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two under legal supervision, Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the waste management company Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for “illegal influence and passive bribery”.
Two state officials from Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the grounds of "the abduction and abuse of public goods by a public service officer", the other on the grounds of "complicity in the abuse of public funds".
Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with "healing and undermining social assets".
Among those faced with Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently jailed for a similar case of public-handed fraud that affected Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company has helped to launder money from “high” criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in public procurement, in particular in the waste sector, is being conducted in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation proceedings.
According to sources close to the investigation, the investigation is focused on the conditions of the procurement and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the Aubagne area as well as from certain cities in the urban watershed of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss Affair: The Elysée Palace Exaggerates Its Intermediary Function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", kept the French public in breath, put the diplomacy in alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attentive gaze of U.S. diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper Le Monde reveal some of the backgrounds of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans who went so far as to give this advice on dealing with their own crisis of “hostage-taking” in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how French officials have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not mean the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by U.S. justice for trafficking material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put a fierce light on the way the French Bureau attempted to manipulate the media in order to make it credible the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 titled "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostage-taking."
François Richier, Elysée’s strategic consultant, spoke with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
He explained the French method.
They advised the Americans to do everything they can to bring back their own nationals who were being forcibly detained in Iran.
“Power noise,” they said, “articulates loudly and clearly and without cessation” the words “fundamental human rights”, “innocence”, “immediate release” in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
“Do this even more, especially because the Iranians are asking you not to do it.”
Because “silence does not solve anything”, bypassing the attempts to discuss in an imperceptible way, the Iranians are “masters in evasive maneuvers”.
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is a “common Iranian tactic”: “Hostage-taking for the purpose of political blackmail.”
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should take place on August 16, the day she fled to the French embassy) “requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians” (230,000 euro deposit).
And he says the Elysée is anticipating further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that “will get worse.”
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago but is still detained in Iran.
Information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demands for illicit trade in sensitive electronics to Iran, has been released from custody following a decision of a judge in Paris.
The U.S. Embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
In an interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only “completely surprised by the judge’s decision,” but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a fierce exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under "strict" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée adviser chooses a telephone number, reads it, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in the buildings managed by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée did not spare its efforts to make believers, through statements and media-organized “flight attempts”, believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an “important” and “influential middle role.”
Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 calls on “the media flash of the French authorities.”
What is so much “thanking” to Mr. Assad based on, the Paris embassy asks.
“Despite their praiseful statements, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then explores the reasons that caused the Elysée to fall for this fiction.
The intense communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008 that was then "perceived by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and unmerited".
“Building up Syria’s role,” Paris said, “is trying to show Syria what promise can be made by playing a constructive role in the region.”
It also aims to “seed disagreements between Syria and Iran.”
The US embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier confided to her: "Of course we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
“But we thanked them despite everything.”
“This should at least confuse the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is in the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law, called the “cinderella,” that will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking access, government officials said.
A bill to urge online gaming operators to deny access to these games to young people under the age of 16 after midnight will be submitted to parliament in December, representatives from culture and family ministries said.
“Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning at school and also living a normal life during the day.”
“We believe this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, a ministerial representative to the French news agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will then be open again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturing companies will have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government is also considering asking manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for access to these games to those youth whose parents ask for it, the official added.
It will also provide free programs for those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “networked” countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in worldwide online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA nominates the country to run
Brightly agitated by corruption suspicions, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday appointed the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which rancoring for influence and lobbying threaten to push technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional high castle (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a bit more exotic; the International Football Federation hopes to be able to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010 or to pursue its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Minister, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) presents the degree of economic and political engagement of a World Cup.
The action behind the scenes threatens to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be as important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which led to the suspension of two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the disclosures, could have equally ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to host the World Cup once, namely in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC showed a documentary report shooting three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who have been lobbying intensely with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government hopes for a re-release of the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who achieved in 2005 for London the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games.
Would this intense effort be enough to re-evaluate the image of England before the Committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack trumps with its already completed stadiums, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadow sides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible retaliations against the British, as well as doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadions, hotels, transportation) has become a significant outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the unwavering hint on the allegations of the English press of "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committee members.
“They are warned with dirt, they are trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, reinforced by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA’s highly sought-after approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which leaves Asian chances out for 2022.
With Australia and Qatar pulling all records with the anticipation of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion toward new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk, because it represents certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights acquired by European countries (due to the time shift), the delicate nerve of FIFA.
The second mandate: transparency
De Gaulle really did.
Mitterand had made him believe he was stuttering.
Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than these.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current president will be an ergo candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not on the side of the mystery attached to the presidency.
So you have to act as if the doubt exists.
In one sense as well as in the other.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac’s supporters argued that a third term was not excluded without even believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision "someday in the fall of 2011".
That on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of UMP parliamentarians the prospect of "two mandates" would sound, therefore, had spread a little fever.
Was that the official announcement of his nomination?
Lots of missing.
The President only reminded that the 2008 constitutional amendment limits the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election in such meetings in a humorous tone.
“In the worst case, you’ll have seven and a half years with me, or in the best case,” he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: “Don’t think I’m not thinking about the phase after.”
His words of the day before make him no more a candidate than the day before, but no less.
If you want to comment, for a two-fold reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the recording of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that many members of the PS urge to fight earlier than thought.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidacy by François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to a survey by BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," the prime minister's environment responded immediately and cautiously.
“If he considered a defeat as possible, he’t be a candidate,” said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe that he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has failed with the openness.
Euro: ECB is forced to keep its purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the ECB’s central banking board last year should provide an opportunity to point out ways to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the order of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of European government debt has forced the central bank in Frankfurt undoubtedly cannot afford to defeat even the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to provoke their worsening.
The political costs would be too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB’s active role in resolving Europe’s public debt.
She has not dared to say whether she thinks the central bank could do more, for example by boosting its program of purchasing government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the ECB, had not spoken much about his plans on the occasion of his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament in Brussels the day before, but rather contented himself with pointing out that the program of purchasing government bonds on the secondary market would "continue" and that we will "see how the decisions go out" at the assembly on Thursday.
The only certainty: the ECB will keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the Treasury’s bond purchases by the ECB doubled last week to approximately 1.35 billion euros.
And according to indiscretions of some merchants, she allegedly made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government bonds yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Between traders, the anticipation of a continued tracking of the purchase price is in no way questionable (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect any significant change.
If the bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB will still be able to freely create its full cash reserves over a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already expecting that this measure will be extended by a few months.
“I can’t imagine that the ECB will change its program in a substantial way.”
"Otherwise, it would risk provoking new tensions in the short-term," said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive withdrawal for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems to me more likely," forecasts Norbert Bräms, a resident at Sal.
by Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the government debt market, “the ECB should maintain such a purchase volume of bonds that revitalizes the sluggish market,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposure position of European banks on the euro area government debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must at all costs stand up to the shortage of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the rush of enthusiasm over the returns paid to the weakest states," a key bond holder testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates start to fly high, states would be further hindered from reducing or even merely stabilizing their debt.
This is the price for protecting the euro.
Berlusconi's government in Italy
After a worrisome start of the week for Italy, the situation has relaxed a little yesterday with the drop of the corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to the fraudulent silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the heads of the region, Giulio Tremonti, had qualified the situation as "indescribable" and heard him expect a "unpredictable" weekend, which the person concerned immediately denied.
On Tuesday, at least, the shares with the German interest rates had reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts covering the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi has pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, expressed "serious concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible threat of infection from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third-largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, a nationalist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain terms, this means that its problem is the lack of economic growth and the associated, dizzying tax revenues that put the state at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... even though the budget present at the Senate for review expects to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates that the budget deficit will still be 4.3% of GDP next year (contrary to the 3.9% forecast by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
Therefore, there is also the riot for a new budget collective, which could be deployed after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says accountant Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently supported by international institutions.
“The foundations of Italy’s economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have repeated for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is in charge of Italy at the IMF.
“At the moment, there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, because despite its high debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011), less stabilization progress is required from Italy than from other countries,” observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The question remains about political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of distrust from the House of Representatives, which could result in early elections being held as early as the end of March.
So there is a slightly favourable period ahead for a decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans consider strengthening anti-crisis measures
In a press conference in Paris, Lagarde said: “I believe it has been proven on Sunday afternoon and evening: Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency area.”
Although completely relative – the deduction recorded yesterday in the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, there is no beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's said it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is especially burdensome on the banking systems," according to the opinion of the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
“The political time is going by much slower than that of the markets.”
The European countries, well aware of both this gap and the danger hidden therein, are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, in the wider sense, with their G20 counterparts are progressing well.
And this also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to strengthen the back of the eurozone countries at the crossroads of the markets (see below).
As for the EU stability funds, their executive director Klaus Regling has already begun his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he is preparing the terrain for this.
The first publicity spending from the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the United States supported a possible increase in the fund mobilized by the additional direct involvement of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the lead, are in the process of implementing structural reforms, in particular in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that will add to the austerity measures, but will have effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid have taken a different path than Greece and Ireland have taken.
Both the one and the other side must avoid, at all costs, having to seek international assistance before they set up their own budget corrections and decide on inevitable structural reforms that will restore their confidence in the long run.
European investors, in turn, are discussing the options available to speed up the normalization process of the government bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on a transit trip to Paris on November 24, was the first to come up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to go back into its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, the leading player in the European government debt market, say an extension of around €100 billion would be sufficient, “preferably” in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This instrument exists: the European Mechanism for Doted Financial Stabilization, which currently amounts to €60 billion.
An advisory board that has every chance to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions worsen.
Snow and Glatte: 24 Departments in Alarm Level Orange
The snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in Orange alert level due to the threat of snow and slopes.
The regions Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have added to the 20 departments already in alert Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowstorms tanger the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, there is slight snow on the Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow coverage is expected from 2 to 5 cm, also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is considerable enough to cause traffic barriers and disrupt certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads have been blocked for heavy traffic over 7.5 tons, including the traffic axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic policemen, who advise not to use your own vehicle only in case of emergency, and the use of some TER travel buses has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardie, school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
There were no specific restrictions on heavy traffic on Wednesday night.
The Prefecture “calls on drivers to be very careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behavior accordingly.”
The General Directorate for Civil Aviation (DGAC) urged airlines to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Paris’s Roissy Airport and 10% from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport economy in Ile-de-France has been in full swing, billions have been raining.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, 23 billion dollars will be paid for the Metro Grand Paris, which will be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start the construction of the SGP, the state has announced a capital donation of 4 billion euros.
In theoretical scheme, this is the amount that would then allow the SGP to lend a portion of the financial amount to double it on the markets.
Today, the first high bills have finally arrived.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the National Assembly’s Finance Commission, contains the measures planned to raise the first portion of these funds.
There are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax for the acquisition and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de-France.
The first, according to article 15 of the bill, goes "in favor of the public-law institute Société du Grand Paris".
The income from this tax amounts to €117 million per year.
The second is a rearrangement of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it, to increase the resulting product and to transfer this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it bring?
is a mystery.
This amount is not mentioned in the text.
The 4 billion is far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of capital donation imposed by the state and gradually paid to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the statement said.
In the SGP, this system is not offensive at all.
"From the moment you record income (the two taxes, i.e.), you can cover the projecting over three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This will be recorded in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which the promised 4 billion will be long to be sought, is at risk of provoking a rather moving, parliamentary discussion.
The first public hearing will take place on December 7.
Revenge hackers and spies
The case of WikiLeaks has a double significance.
On the one hand, it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and gives a taste of the future dominated by regression.
But let’s go on to the turn.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by an intelligence agency (an x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper clips.
The “extraordinary” American disclosures about Berlusconi’s sexual habits throw away nothing more than what one got to read in every x-any newspaper anyway for months (except for those whose owner is Berlusconi), and Gaddafi’s terrifyingly caricaturized profile has long provided cabaret artists with material for their sketches.
The rule that the secret files may only consist of already known news is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not until this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that every work (on the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosary) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not just because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (even because he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
The secret documents as well.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited in mind) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be anything, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers as true what he acknowledges.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why was such an uproar about the disclosures of these files made?
On the one hand, these say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of World War II and since then even the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have turned into spy centers, with the exception of a few small representative tasks.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not by hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an X-voluntary hacker can seize the most secret secrets of the world’s most powerful nation is a major blow to the prestige of the state desertion.
In addition, the scandal brings less of the victims, rather than the "charf judges" in trouble.
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what happened.
Once, in Orwell’s time, all power could be bundled together like a Big Brother controlling every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have proven perfectly correct since then, where one could control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you take into consideration what is happening today, that even the secret crypt of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – elected to avenge the citizen – can bring the secrets of power to life.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets stand?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secret as it discloses the public sphere; but to disclose in the style of WikiLeaks that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to deprive them of any power.
WikiLeaks has not wronged Sarkozy or Merkel, but against Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this insult to such enormous power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer post any reserved information online – that would be the same as putting a poster on the corner of the street.
But it’s just as obvious that with current technologies, it’s futile to hope to be able to keep confidential reports confidential over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state is moving in an airplane and has contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private, only for certain ears, relationships beined in the future?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see myself forced to imagine the government agents moving secretly on uncontrollable routes, carrying their messages with them nowhere but in the mere memory, and, moreover, hiding the few written information they have received in the shoe bag.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed boxes: basically, the Watergate spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer these days, namely, backwards.
A century after wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet is reconstructing a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled film researchers to explore a film band by band by rolling back and forth and unleashing all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro proportions.
The high-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while it takes three and a half hours by plane, including switching.
It is therefore not exceptional that politics and communication technology come back to car and horse.
A last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that require confidential information from the press.
Climate Change: How France Improves Its Financial Promises
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the rapidly resolved financing promises (also called "fast start" or early financing) that have been realized by developing countries.
And already the rough French beauties have been uncovered.
Under the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged €7.2 billion over three years, while France has pledged €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU drew all records to convince its partners of its commitment to fast-start funding: detailed report on the actions of its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and highly valued for its true value: developing countries and civil society would like to see it when all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track to fulfill its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be “new and additional” to ensure that additional investment has been put in place without detrimental impact on public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what “new and additional” means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the guideline he considers best.
For example, the European Commission has chosen itself as a benchmark for the year 2009: international funding will beined and 150 million euros will be provided under the “fast-start” funding over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France considered the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there are no reference values for the previous year’s spending or for public development aid at the global level.
Specifically, the total amount of French aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) – France pretends to meet its commitment regarding “new and additional” funding.
Another crucial element is the separation in donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, consider 1 borrowed € as equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is just hard to accept: the effort is incomparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often emission insulation projects based on the most efficient technology) can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro obtained as the equivalent of a donated euro... Furthermore, only the cost of the loan should be accounted for as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking 91,5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and donating 8,5% of 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that uses large-scale loans.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) pay their obligations 100% by donations.
In other words, if the overwhelming majority of the European Union spends 1 euro to meet its obligations, France will only give 10 cents and understood a comparable contribution.
A beautiful hockey!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double deception: on the one hand with a further development of the action over time and on the other hand with the reality of the financial effort.
France manages to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promises, saving €36.1 million.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once within the EU (why do the other member states continue to donate if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not allow themselves to be completely deceived...
The chapter on early financing is just a small matter in a relatively short time compared to the whole of climate discussions.
But it could be the drop too much in the UNFCCC’s immense machinery.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Either way, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of early financing.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its accounting method for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and equal justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring forward the discussions on the controversial subject of long-term financing (another, crucial and currently discussed topic): one does not escape the question of the “predictability” or the accounting method of its loans.
France could change its position to be as progressive on disputes as it is on other matters.
So the hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France’s fast-start and its vision of “predictability” as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child consumes 81 different chemicals a day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (a former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which stated that its findings “do not reflect a statistically significant value in view of the small number of samples analysed, but rather represent an illustration of the problem addressed,” had between July and September purchased the food typically consumed within four, by a ten-year-old child at the meals, plus an intermittent meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals – including the official recommendations of five fresh fruits and fruits, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day – have been studied as well as lab snacks in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, including 42 classified as potentially or likely carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptors, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
“Even if, in the almost totality of cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, it is very clear from this survey that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruptors is worrying,” the association notes.
Already at breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three proven to be safe as carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as an intermediate meal for the study, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included at lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
Furthermore, the hacksteak, the tuna from the box, even the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemicals were spit.
In the pipe water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chlorophores.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the "most abundant" with 34 identified chemical residues, and even the plastic dish used to heat the meal in the microwave wasn't unloaded.
The final risk of this “pollutant cocktail” for consumers “is likely underestimated,” the study says.
The “Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts” (EE-LV) has, in view of the urgency of the situation, proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the “increase in civilizational diseases”.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) referred to the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
