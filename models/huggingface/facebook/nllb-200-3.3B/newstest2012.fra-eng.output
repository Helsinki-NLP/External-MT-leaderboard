Parliament has not ratified the amendment for Tymoshenko's release
The Ukrainian parliament has rejected, in an amendment to the criminal law, the draft to cancel the paragraph on the indictment of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
MEPs rejected at second reading the draft amendment to reduce sentences for economic crimes, which could have opened the door to freedom for the now imprisoned former Prime Minister.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having made a previously unfavorable deal with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not final and the court is due to rule on the convict's appeal in December.
Tymosenko calls the ruling political revenge of the regime and has provoked a process of suspicions of bias of the court also in the West.
The bill to revoke Article 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 MPs.
It would have taken 226 votes to pass.
Libyan victory is a fact.
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners are yet to be determined.
As is the custom in the region, the winners in the elections are the Islamists, but whether it is the moderates or the radicals.
The National Provisional Council has decreed the customary law of the Sharia and we already know what it is.
Libya is becoming a crime-free country because for robbery, you cut off your hand.
Women can forget emancipation, any non-respect for the faith is subject to capital punishment...
It is the Quran that will unite the society composed of opposing tribes instead of the personality of the dictator.
In Libya there will be such order that we cannot imagine it and certainly would not like it.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and probably would not be advantageous for Libyans.
It is particularly astonishing that the Islamist warriors have gratefully accepted the help of the infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated with each attack.
So when it comes to looking for winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We have participated in the shootings, served Islam and our politicians have turned away from the dictator as a political ally without it bringing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
So it's no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crows".
Without occupying the land, oil companies will have easy access to the Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much, and the West will finally be able to boast of protecting human rights.
I don't care if those sharia followers stop us.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sights of investors.
A whirlwind of statistics swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the states has published GDP information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are not only looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have published their economic development forecasts for the third quarter earlier.
Germany's GDP is forecast to grow by 0.5% and France by 0.4%.
Both countries modified the data for the second quarter, in which Germany improved from the expected growth (0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (there was talk of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that we are heading towards a gradual decrease in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts predicted.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, according to forecast data, which are recalculated periodically.
The eurozone and EU economies grew by 0.2% between July and September compared with the previous quarter, which was in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
The yield on the ten-year bonds is 28.45%
The yields of Spanish and Italian bonds are climbing to critical limits.
The problems are starting to be felt in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Czech bond yields remain below 4% as the situation in the region worsens.
There are voices in Germany that the ECB should be the guarantee of last resort .
The Czechs have qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and are celebrating qualification for 200 million
The football team has accomplished their most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football team has also successfully defended its qualification in the second round and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first half and a lot of luck for the second.
The Czech team also won thanks to the Czech super hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 to Montenegro and celebrated his qualification to the European Championship.
The Montenegrin team was under pressure until the second half due to a precise Czech defense.
The losers of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score.
And thanks to super Petr Cech the Czech team will not be absent from the European Championship next year, plus a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football fund.
From the first minutes we played warrior football.
Both teams struggled to put together combinations and the game was mostly centered around the center line.
The pressure of the national football players did not penetrate the Czech defense which responded accurately to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around an Iranian nuclear site.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students started praying at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Isfahan created a human shield on Tuesday around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center where uranium is processed.
They have openly stated that they would defend their country's nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has found in its latest report that Iran has been steadily building up its nuclear arsenal.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students started praying at noon outside the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the objective of which would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets would not only be Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: does not eat breakfast and takes meat for dinner
Over one third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight, 9% of schoolchildren are overweight and 5% are obese.
As recent research shows, obese children come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This again shows how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models that surround him are.
For example, the proportion of meat products on the tables of obese children is 50% higher than that of normal-weight families.
19% of obese had French fries for dinner according to survey conducted with awareness campaign "Obesity is not an accident"
In families with small children, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schoolchildren today - only 15% said that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out during the last school year and involved 900 pupils from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of the 'Obesity is not an accident' campaign, supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever company.
Since the beginning, more than 12000 students from the sixth to the third grade have enrolled in this project.
One of the key factors driving a dramatic increase in the number of overweight and even obese children is the lack of proper nutrition and physical exercise.
"Only half of the children surveyed said that eating five times a day, for example, breakfast - lunch - snack - dinner, is one of the basic principles of a healthy diet", says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and no meatballs for dinner .
Experts point out that for healthy development, some basic things are needed, such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the families of the students eat at the same time as me.
In most families, breakfast is eaten alone.
And the worst thing that's been found is that one tenth of the population doesn't eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a healthy diet.
The questionnaire showed that obese children's families are more likely to eat unhealthy fries.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly participate in sports, but only 15 percent of the parents do.
You make your own food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from the possibilities offered according to their own tastes and personal opinions.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal when it comes to healthy eating".
Among their favorite foods are many cakes, meat, and sweets.
"The most alarming is a strong preference for sweetened lemonade", says the survey.
For lunch, pasta took first place, just ahead of white meat.
The children did not want any starches and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
The health sector
The survey also showed that children are prepared to change their habits once they receive ad hoc information.
"A group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the 'Obesity is not an accident' awareness session showed a strong desire to switch to a healthy diet", the survey results state.
The most striking was for example the case of sugary lemonade, as children began to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often checked white meat and fish as the main dish and would cut down on sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech special bread-and-potatoes).
Stylists must also be good psychologists, say professionals
In an introductory article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry that there were so many of them at the beginning.
I didn't think about what was going to happen next.
The presentations of three professionals in the field, the costumes of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the ground.
And it will get worse.
The closer we get to the final exams, the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "drunk".
This time we have with the headmistress Alenka (in the class there are no boys) dealt with how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without any particular curve, another overweight.
The stylist must know how to visually reduce the width of arms, lengthen the neck or add the necessary curves.
We've managed to emphasize the character nicely and also not dress too flashy types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
If there is a difference between the waist and the hips, for example, so that the skirt or pants do not fit at all, it is worthwhile to have it made to measure.
And you won't regret it because a flawlessly fitting garment is priceless.
You will feel much better in a custom-made skirt than in one that is constantly slipping, winding and not sticking to the belt and so on.
For those with a masculine appearance, they may have the luxury of Tucker-style clothing, with pieces of fabric sewn together, or even embroidered.
There are obviously many examples of different appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort through all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that in terms of what I have to do at home there's too much.
Each intern was given a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of fashion of the personality as well as his appearance.
I'll have to dress Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Deep down, I'm glad, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has gained almost a hundred kilos recently (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the Internet, print and work on the graphic design.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to consider the graphic part of the styling.
The stylist not only dresses the body but creates, for example, productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, has brought us all this.
But that... until Sunday.
The stylist has to have a big-picture vision.
Three guests from the special added a different twist to Saturday's session, filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka, fashion graphic designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer. This is the first time we've had a meeting with the two.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single garment in a different way.
Variability is paramount in this example.
Like this trench coat that should be worn in a classic way with jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with scarves and take it as a dress.
Or just roll up your sleeves or collar and you instantly have a new look.
"Play with it", he stressed.
But I especially appreciated the following advice: "For the job you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then start to counter it", Jakub said.
I finally understand why we try so hard to learn these rules, what to do with them, to what, why, when in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statements on the fashion shows.
I know again, from fashion photographer Ben, that the stylist must have many more variations of clothing than the ones that are photographed.
This means that for a fashion story that will have ten pages (so a dozen models) I must be ready to "retail" at least fifteen of them.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different from reality.
We have to take that into account when creating a model.
The fact that image and style are sometimes half of success was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna, who's not a super singer, but her image and marketing made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylists' services remains frosty.
And familiar faces sometimes consider them useless (as long as I know something but what I look like is secondary).
And if someone gets a styling done on us, we then have to rely on the fact that he will dictate to us with a high probability a completely different (smaller) size than the one he actually has.
Then we just need to go to Google and see if the tabloids are reporting on the celebrity in question, whether she's lost weight or gained weight, etc.
Honza and Mario made it clear to us on Sunday that it is not enough for a stylist to know fashion and to know how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he's dressing and so it's important to be a good psychologist.
You know, you have to be able to guess people, not flatter yourself, keep your own opinions.
"When a manager asks you to sort out her wardrobe and fill it with new items you can't just throw it all away and say, 'Oh, my God, that's horrible.'"
"You will find some things that you find pretty and you will advise him how to wear them", says Mario.
This one showed us exactly what everything should contain, what is called the "placovka" or stylist's bag.
It's the one you hang around your waist and carry around with you for whatever you need.
In addition to clearly defined items such as scissors, hair removal rollers, and baby pins, there are also nylon threads (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags or hats), special clips with which to close a garment in the back if it is too large (the pin or other type of clip is not used because it could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we would not just be people who listened but who tried something in a practical way, they taught us how to properly fit shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the flat-surface studio, the sole could be damaged, let alone the outside.
And so we stuck and stuck.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors to avoid accidentally injuring ourselves.
So it really does take skill.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me on my creation.
The account I'm reporting is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of classes
I'm beginning to understand that making a career out of styling is not a walk in the park, no matter what anyone says.
The need for speed is being fought all over America.
Reviewed
What started out as a smooth ride turns into a routine morning commute to work because of a bunch of stupid mistakes by people who have nothing to do with it.
It fulfils everyone's ambition to some extent but it's useless if no one wants to do anything more.
The new game, subtitled The Run, has generated high expectations ahead of its release.
It promised to take a new direction with the already aged Need for Speed racing series and to bring out a kind of game from the playable parts that would not just count with points.
So we were curious to see what the extra scenes would be like where the main character gets out of the car and does whatever he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what we expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole thing is going downhill because of some unnecessary bugs that have been around for years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of incomprehensible sloth on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts off well.
You are caught up in the adventure of which the main character Jack has character problems and to solve them starts to participate in illegal races across America.
You're behind the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to be the first to New York.
There are some interesting elements to the idea.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 courses.
As a result, each race is on a different route and the stages are set in different environments that are quite distinct from each other and interesting.
The player does not feel for a moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are of course quite nice even if the graphic technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
It's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in snow-capped mountains is very pleasing to the eye.
The tests are also sometimes accompanied by an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful not to get hit by an avalanche.
Besides that, the different races are neatly arranged one after the other.
There are only a few of them, but that's enough.
There are moments when you are trying to outrun the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) and then you are racing against the clock (classic duel with the stopwatch) and then you are waiting for another duel with an opponent.
Every once in a while you also have the police coming in and trying to make things difficult for you.
The new thing is the off-vehicle passages.
It's more of an interactive animation where most of the time Jack is running away from someone and you have to help him by hitting the right button at the right time.
It's not that complicated.
What's surprising is that there are fewer of these moments than you'd expect (there are actually only three).
The result is that this element is not likely to be an obstacle and is, in the context described above, in the elements that make gambling enjoyable.
The driving pattern is in the tradition of the previous games.
Which means that there's nothing extraordinary about it at the moment, but it's not necessarily a negative thing.
As for the realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But although we can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So it's all right.
The problems start to show up after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not yet developed.
We don't expect this game to be complicated and deformed and collision-prone, but when you don't have any idea of how your car is behaving when you're in a collision with any object, it's not quite good.
In close overtaking, you sometimes touch each other slightly, but otherwise your car goes into a frenzy.
Or it's found in pieces.
Thanks to the reboot system, it's not really a problem, but it really annoys you.
The restart is done so that when you've broken the figure or you've gone out of the set the game takes you back to the moment of the last point on the itinerary.
But you only have five reboots.
When you've used all five reboots you have to start the game over from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, in case something goes wrong, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes restarting doesn't help and you have to find the solution by memorizing the route piece in question.
The great thing about this game is that the same actions end up in the same places.
For example, there are certain corners that you have to go through in a certain way or else you won't.
Otherwise, you will meet "civilian" vehicles in a given place, always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds ahead or one minute behind.
What is irritating are situations where you see the opponent easily pass between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either move to the side and outline them or brake.
It doesn't matter if you go in front of it because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always comes right up to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you arrive at certain places, again without caring about the weather, and you always have the same opponent who is in the same place before you.
It's most annoying at the end of the game when you're driving on a long bridge in reverse.
The enemy must pass in front of you at all costs.
When it passes you it blocks your view of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you get into a lot of collisions.
We can understand that the goal of this game is to do something exciting and adrenaline-filled, but it's clear that you get bored quickly.
And that's a shame because through a simple behavior pattern the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it doesn't matter if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there's no chance of boredom or anything else.
The original idea is to change cars during the races.
You have to be careful at the petrol stations on the routes because you can change cars there, but most of the time the one you have is enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, American big-displacement cars for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic features on highly technical roads such as mountain lace roads.
And the challenge mode, which is racing in particular places that you know from adventure, goes very well with the main story mode.
You not only receive medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you reach the highest conductor level, various objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog function which among other things compares your scores with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the hardest hits to take is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You drive your car into the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speedometer tells you between 90 and 100 miles an hour (pre-arranged), and behind you comes a subway train that sends your car straight to the scrap heap.
In the editorial department we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought when creating this game or whether the authors really think we're idiots.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What's troubling is that in more extreme situations, the imagery doesn't hold up and in some cases tragically.
This is especially true for accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging system is no longer useful.
The sound part is good and the track is choice.
In an effort to appeal to the largest number and especially the youngest audience a new soundtrack has been created in the style of "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
So the overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is really confusing.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game feels like it's not over.
The fun is great, but be prepared for the mistakes to hit you in the eye with the force of an airfield reflector.
The Students of Velour in concert with the Choirs of Charles University
The Festa Academica festival is offering for the third time festivities that link the International Students' Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival 20 choirs from the upper secondary schools and classes perform.
The festival culminated in two organ concerts on 17 November.
"Charles University has a big part in this festival".
"Among the choirs is the Choir of the Faculty of Pedagogy and Humanities, and the festival committee is headed by the rector Vaclav Hampl", says the head of the organising team Jakub Calou.
The highlight of the festival is the concert of the Choir of Secondary Schools and Classes which takes place with free admission on November 17 from 2 pm on the space located in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program includes the composition of the well-known Czech jazzman Karel Ruzicka, Celebration Jazz mass.
In the evening, the "Students of Velvet" concert takes place in the National House in Vinohrady, with the choirs of the higher schools and the Charles University.
The Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate the International Students' Day with dignity and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present to the public choir music of the highest level and to develop the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organiser is the Union of Czech Churches in cooperation with the Jan Kepler High School.
The whole action is placed under the aegis of Bohuslav Svoboda, Mayor of Prague and Vaclav Hampl, Rector of Charles University.
The festival takes place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The programme also includes high-level concerts, musical meetings, a student happening and other activities.
All information is available on the website of the festival www.festaacademica.cz.
Vice-President, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war".
"It will take 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all the players get used to their new role", began Milena Vicenova, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, in her speech at the Faculty of Law.
When she succeeded in describing the different EU bodies and their relations in such a clear and visible way that many lecturers at the Faculty of Law at Charles University could envy her, she showed how seriously she takes her motto 'understandably and openly about Europe'.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticism was that he was dull, that he was a total loser, that he could not fulfill any mission and I must say that he took everyone's breath away because he played his part perfectly".
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 Member States, communicate with them well and has a clear vision of where Europe is going".
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy was explained by the Commissioner in her answer to the question: 'Who is who in the European Union?' 'Which telephone number should I call?' as an important step towards uniformity and greater clarity of the Union's policy towards states such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us from our syrecky.
Mrs Vicenova also referred to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She described the Czech presidency two years ago as a success.
The Czechs have solved the financial crisis, the gas crisis or organised a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation to the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the Ambassador, "business has been in full swing" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis which is still unravelling.
The new seventh budget of the Union must also be approved, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
The budget will be thin and in order to save money, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, all this will have to be resolved in the framework of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels: 'For a Europe that can be understood'.
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand it is true that in Brussels nobody makes round or twisted pickles, or bananas of different sizes or that nobody has forbidden us to make syrecky".
She wants to make better use of the EU environment and to see more Czechs in the EU institutions.
A multi-speed Europe is in the making
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptical and people who only see things in their negative rather than positive aspects.
It also regrets the small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, she said, was due to several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a cover letter and the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she then underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, the Hungarian, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me: 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this group from Visegrad doing?' and he is not at all happy".
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should be able to take decisions on the basis of the results of the negotiations.
The concept of a two-speed Europe, or even a multi-speed Europe, prevails rather than a 'new European federation'.
"We have countries in the eurozone and some outside the eurozone".
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute for enhanced cooperation".
First of all, it was said that those countries that wanted to cooperate with each other and those that did not wanted to cooperate with each other stayed in their corner".
"There will be many such institutes and there will be a truly two-speed Europe", she expects.
In this respect, it also welcomed the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye's mission to establish the basis for all EU-related issues to be discussed among all EU members, not just euro-zone members.
The history of a brand:
The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence
If anyone were to look for the closest word to IBM's strategy, the closest would be "long-term".
For a large public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has passed a hundred years.
The foundation for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm's first chief, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left behind the slogan that many of the world's problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
The slogan "PENSE'!" became the banner around which the life of a future giant would develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was the basis of the care company culture that Watson had developed.
For us IBM means long-term thinking of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years because it always stayed true to its core values and yet was not afraid to change everyone around it.
It's enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more", said the firm's current director, Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, started taking care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic -- the IBM people were the only among the first American employees to have paid vacation, employer-paid insurance plus a stylish employee uniform and a well-crafted reward system for inventors and salespeople.
In the same way IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was a brilliant early-stage talent scout -- one of the first firms to abolish all forms of discrimination and thus have a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano as head of IBM.
She has worked for IBM for thirty years and is currently Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in the last few years has been doing what is called jamy, online brainstorming from which many future strategies and innovations have come.
It's no wonder he has a lot of ideas - the firm has nearly 500,000 people working for it.
An Institution with a Good Name
It is the internal and external image of the firm that ensures its secure position in the business world.
"From the beginning, IBM was more an institution than a technology company", said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor of economics at Harvard Business School and author of the IBM book.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology", added Geogre Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market.
IBM - or the "Big Blue", as it is known in the United States, in reference to its slogan - has grown into one of the largest firms in the world in a hundred years.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services from server products to nanotechnology.
It holds many patents from all the top US technology firms and five of its employees have been awarded Nobel Prizes.
Among his discoveries are the cash machine, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode or the floppy disk.
IBM was the second largest technology firm by market capitalisation this year with $220 billion, after Apple, when it overtook Microsoft for the first time in 1996.
Early preview
Not all innovations and inventions were the preference of the customer and the time - IBM for example did not succeed in betting on its own operating system OS/2, the Prodige online service or the IBM PCjr computer:
"Once your business is built on moving forward you cannot emotionally cling to the past", remarked Samuel J. Palmisano.
So IBM has no problem building its foundation on many platforms and when they don't work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, its competitor Microsoft, which is based on the Windows operating system.
A technology with a future
In IBM's revenue, services, which are made up of a fifth of software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However, in 1990 it was still the strongest hardware representative with more than the motivation of participation.
From 2000 onwards, IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, during which time it invested $58 billion in the acquisition of future technologies.
It continues to invest and even from 2008 when for the first time it surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM trades according to the precepts of its first head Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Economic Crisis also increased his investment volume.
It now appears that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
IBM's share price has skyrocketed 120 percent since 2008, and the firm's net profit continues to grow.
The IBM logo is about changing everything but its values.
This is to be expected, however, that this flexible giant will be able to cope with other crises.
The story of IBM: from sliced cheese to spaceflight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it was originally called the complicated Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - originally it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies like the old "pointers", clocks that would record the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 chaired the company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of the firm - it was Watson's ideas that the company's identity and culture have been based on until now.
Watson ran the firm until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese slicers and meat slicers to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, sales multiplied to $9 million and the firm began to expand to all parts of the world.
Watson was so indispensable to the firm that after 40 years at the helm, his son Thomas Watson Jr. took over as CEO.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM's people and computers helped NASA guide space flights - to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 to the Moon.
By 1964, IBM had developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that set the standard for computers at the time, the IBM 5150 was released in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been successful in the last three years - is the Smarter Planet concept - "a smarter planet".
Its aim is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited such as transport and urban management.
In the field of commerce, IBM has recently developed a 'Smarter Commerce' platform which helps salespeople to manage the entire sales cycle.
IBM has a strong history in our territory as well.
It opened its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern European Centre is based in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team for speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her cheating husband:
Ivette, you can keep that donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53) said, it is finished!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became the bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his rosy dream and return home.
But she couldn't wait and set clear rules for the future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner", explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Ryktarova gave Bartosova a summer home in her house, she had no idea that her marriage would not last.
When Iveta insisted after 30 days to move from Ricany, Pepa did not reject the singer.
And he publicly admitted that he loved her.
In time, Darina came to accept her husband's affair and finally said goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome him on the doorstep of the house.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will throw him out".
"He will no longer be my old, beloved, lost donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship", Rychtarova leaked, showing that she has broken off from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina locked the door on him is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'll stay with Iveta and not change".
"My wife has arranged a paper marriage and I respect that".
"The company continues, I do the repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy".
"Darina and I talk in a completely normal way but we don't sleep together", Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop her.
"We're not sleeping together, and I don't care where she goes, who she goes with, or if she's having an affair.
I know it was my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility", Joseph concluded.
Women's worst vices - Do they affect you?
If you ask men to name some of the vices that are common to women, they are all capable of pulling them out of their own pockets.
My dear ladies, you will learn in the following lines of the female vices that get to pump the blood from the veins of men.
Purchasing
Has your partner ever complained about your shopping habits?
Should you buy at least one item of clothing a week?
You're happy to buy in bulk and at the point of sale?
In your case, we can speak of shopping as a vice.
Some women feel that they should limit their passion for shopping.
But you say, which one would resist the window-shopping of clothing stores, looking for nice clothes for oneself and then trying them all on in a cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And while shopping is a hobby for most women, it can become a living hell for men.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse he was waiting at the door...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
"I need to lose at least 10 pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me?"
Do these phrases not remind you of anything?
- I know.
So you're one of those women who's obsessed with her looks.
It's not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are allergic to their partner always complaining about their appearance.
The stronger sex does not hesitate to say that the more frequent these complaints increase, the more poisonous women become.
Cleanliness and Cleanliness First
It's like an endless ride.
Washing the windows, vacuuming, cleaning the floors, dusting, and picking the bathroom - and that's twice a week.
You're making remarks to your partner about walking with dirty feet on clean floor, to the kids about salivating the sink, smudging the living room glass, and that it gives you a lot of work?
If you are one of these, try to keep in mind that nothing should be overstated and that order and cleanliness should not be the first concern in the home.
This harmless desire for cleanliness, however, can disrupt family relationships and even the peace of the home.
The work of sap
"I'm throwing this old suit in the garbage".
"Are you going to wear those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has no place on the floor".
If you do this digging work on your partner several times a day, you're really going to break him down.
It's obvious you don't mean any harm. You want everything to be flawless.
Maybe if men knew that, women wouldn't have to do so much digging work...
Slander and Slander
Slander, flattery, and even insults against someone are also common among some women.
Women are particularly relationship oriented and thus delight in dealing with topics like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us is letting out a little harmless sniveling here and there.
The hand on the heart is a woman's special feature.
But the worst are those who give advice, persecute, even despise others and are especially dangerous to those around them - especially at work in a women's collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hockey forward Jagr was a two-time winner for Philadelphia during Monday's NHL game on Carolina's ice and is again leading the Czech league in productive players for the contest.
From the standpoint of 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who also made one more pass and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases.
Jagr's Jakub Voracek also scored two goals in the match.
Jagr told the reporters overseas that he had warned Giroux that it would be a big night.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick".
"I felt it".
"Sometimes that feeling comes over you", Jagr said after his action, as Giroux scored a goal on the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later there was a second assault by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goal for the puck and introduced him to goal scorer Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, home run run Patrick Dwyer made a down, but the start of the second half belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically in Giroux.
In a partnership with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds converted a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league but he's really in the top three", Jagr said of his center.
"I never thought I'd end my career playing hockey with a player like him".
"I'm really happy about this".
"I want to play on him".
"All those years in the NHL the other players on the team tried to play me, now it's my turn", Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shoot-out she finished with a goal difference.
Matt Read didn't rule out other complications that ended up in a two-on-one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area".
"He tapped on the paddle, I picked up speed and (Read) moved to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got it", described the last goal of the match from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia came in with this win to lead the Eastern Conference.
Czech defender Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo, coming off the bench in the second third because of an upper-body injury.
The Canadiens couldn't hold on to a seasoned defender, their two-goal lead was taken after a 3-2 penalty.
Tomas Plekanec hasn't turned any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the back line was sick that bothered the home coach more than the missed points because they played the game with only 5 defenders.
"This is bad".
"We played the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young people".
"But there is nothing to be done, it is just the way it is", says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement after replacement" "It wasn't enough and we couldn't resist".
"We just had to simplify the game, push the paddle out of our zone".
For that we had limits", added one of the advocates P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender who took part in the 30th attack on Winnipeg and the victory at Tampou Bay.
Five different shooters participated in the Jets' goals, which ended a five-game losing streak.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at this time offered trips mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, as trips to the west were very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays to East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both on the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have a Western bias and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for citizens of the socialist bloc (also for Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the socialist countries.
In the case of the Czechoslovak citizen wishing to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, he needed an invitation letter otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but you had to either stand in line all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good acquaintance" in the travel agency.
And even after that, it was still not won.
The currency agreement that was the condition for traveling west was denied to the politically incorrect people who couldn't travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not, however, exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the West.
The Czech people spent most of their holidays in the country, so there were many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought and this practice continues to this day.
Travel in the Czech Republic has undergone a major change since 1989.
Although until 1989 holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at their peak, last year the Czechs spent 4 million days abroad on holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we don't realize today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in the neighbouring countries of the West has led to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria, to Vienna and Germany.
Czechs could not for a long time travel by air to the west that everyone wanted to see at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel agencies made us Czech women sleep in tents in the parks because our incomes did not allow us to pay for hotel or boarding.
The typical feature of a Czech traveler in those days was to take along his own canned food, sausage, etc... to save money.
Another important moment was the interchangeability of the Czech crown, which allowed our tourists to finally buy Western currency freely after decades.
Our standard of living and average wage have increased, which brought about another important moment around 1997.
Due to the increasing demand for travel, travel agencies have since 1997 started to arrange tours with air charter connections which, through contracts, have greatly reduced costs compared to what was available before.
In the late 1990s, the Czechs had visa-free travel to virtually all the developed countries of the world, except the EU, which later made it easier for us to travel.
Another interesting moment in the post-revolutionary tourism history was when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, direct air charters have taken Czech tourists to distant warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
That's more than 100,000 Czechs who visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully fit into the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also, for the first time in history, the Czech people spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15 000 CZK per person for holidays abroad including related costs.
The General Assembly must find its President but this may end up in a situation without a solution "a pat"
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and it is likely that Ivan Hasek's successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic will not be known yet after a General Assembly is due to take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on the voting rules.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for any of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the Czech football board.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the post-Hasek era did football turn back to divergences between the Association's chambers that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when a new president had to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House in Prague because the negotiations were deadlocked and there was no discussion of how to elect.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only the statutory representatives or also the officials with full powers.
On this one point there has been a partial agreement since then, also with the help of the State and Law Bureau, that representation on the basis of absolute majority is not possible.
The differences still persist over the rules for the election.
It is all too clear that the Executive Committee, in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also done nothing to improve the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the crux of the matter remains the same.
The question is, how do you go for the third round without falling into the trap?
"The point of contention is that either we proceed according to the statutes or we find another model",said one of the three vice-presidents of the Czech Football Association, Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association.
The rules of the model are that the candidate who receives the most votes in the house for which he is a candidate wins the third round.
Moravia is reportedly ready to withdraw so that the candidate who receives the highest percentage of votes in both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept", admits Svoboda who understands the objections of the Moravian side and according to whom it would be better not to change the regulations and vote according to the statutes in force.
Surprisingly, Tomas Paclik also agrees, even though he believes that the electoral rules established by the statutes favor Pelta the most among all the candidates.
"I want the vote to be taken as much as possible in accordance with the association's statutes".
"So that there are no more foolish ideas imagined by a representative as in past General Assemblies", said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations defined himself mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is optimistic.
He believes that there will be a new President in Nymburk and that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a constructive way.
"Today's possible qualification for the European Championships should calm everyone down".
"Football will be on a wave of happiness again and there will be more enthusiasm for cooperation", adds the Jablonec official, who among the three has the most experience in managing football both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense".
"It's not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the regulations by design".
"This could cause another deadlock in the General Assembly".
"I hope that common sense will win", Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement on all sides.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can say if the entire football management will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorica, which was to carry among others Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was being sought to take part of the executive committee to the field of reprisals.
In the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to welcome the divided parties into the strongest sports association in the country and bring them to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state funding, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclik is running for president because he doesn't see any candidate who is right.
If the head of the Plzen footballers Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have met all his demands for a new President of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not have been campaigning for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not run for office".
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate", Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to enter into competition with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to precisely try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of the AFRT who a priori would be given the advantage for this election.
Paclik also stressed that if he wins the elections he would hold the post of President only until 2013 when a General Assembly is scheduled.
He would see the job as a manager with experience and a high level of experience but who is not connected with the world of football.
"I've talked to people who would have the profile", he says.
"For me it was terrible when some told me that they did not want to be identified with Czech football at the moment".
"I would like to change that image", he added.
What is said to be most troubling to Paclik is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Plzen Regional Football Union Roman Berbr, a man of contrary reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates to the General Assembly.
Paclik says it's not acceptable that Pelta holds the position of President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football".
"And with the support of Berbr, which is a high-flying merchant, it would be even less favorable to football", proclaimed Paclik.
What shocks him further is the fact that Pelta's name was mentioned a few years ago during wiretaps in connection with a corruption investigation, which Pelta got away with.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football".
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I will sell the club from Plzen".
In case Paclik wins Thursday's vote, he would have to prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been endorsed by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco, thinks the same.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with".
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself as head of the delegation, for example".
"But as manager of the Association he would not be able".
"I don't stick my nose in what I don't know", says Paclik who in September drew a lot of attention when he spoke for the cancellation of the Arbitration Commission with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims he's qualified to run the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to run private companies and that he also runs since last year the Plzen club which celebrated with his support last May its triumph in the first division.
"I have the power to make a difference in the world of sport and bring a certain culture to it".
"I would curb the influence of certain interested groups which, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste", added Paclik who does not seek his antipathy for the leader of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power with high-level politicians would help to get more money for sport from the games tax.
"This is one of the key issues that the new president should address".
"If it is the gambling tax as the political parties are saying, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes", he said.
Paclik does not take his current relationship with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT President should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
"It's not ideal".
I don't see any reason to pass on my shares of the Plzen club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later", Paclik said.
Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT which should put an end to the pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to the quarrels about the rules for the elections.
The Jablonec official is looking forward to Thursday's meeting in Nymburk with great optimism and believes that the success of the football team today should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta before the September elections, which did not take place, promised to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial means if he is elected.
He decided to run at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and this two-month delay could well give him the opportunity to defend his vision of football management and present it in a wider context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for Thursday to see a president".
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association", he adds, but he is above all connected with the Jablonec club, worked a great number of years at Sparta and on the Union's Executive Committee.
It is also why he has enough experience to run Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election lies a euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone saw".
"If it weren't for all these different interpretations, we would have had a President since September", stresses Pelta.
It was the revision of the civic association's most important document that captured the attention of the delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as a personal mission and I am prepared to take full responsibility if it doesn't work out".
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist", added Pelta.
Then he tries, they say, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl, whom he recognizes in view of his legal training and that he knows for certain that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He also hasn't attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, who on the contrary doesn't stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been in football for a year and has already had some success".
"His attacks were not the most honorable, however, and surprised many during the campaign".
"That is also why some now have doubts about his character", Pelta said of his opponent, but he said he remained true to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to the national team.
It should be a football game.
"And I would also endeavor to close all cases that begin with the Bohemians or the continuation of the corruption scandal".
"I would immediately enter negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football", the 46th candidate told Czech News Agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not lead to any change in personnel.
"I should get to know all the employees", he told Strahov, who was understandably nervous about the absence of management.
Although there are some catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he thinks the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is one point of disagreement about how to vote in the third round we will manage to overcome it".
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when it has a new leader", Pelta said optimistically two days before what was likely to be the decisive day in his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT will start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the General Assembly on Thursday, many people will not like it, he said.
Rajchl, however, promises that if he is elected, we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and to make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As president, I want to take care of football in its entirety".
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and high-performance youth football".
"But I'm not saying I'll do it all alone", Rajchl said in an interview with CTK.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the responsibilities within the Executive Committee so that each member is dealing with a specific area".
"And I will distribute difficult assignments so that football faces a big step forward".
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others", he added.
He reportedly said that he would not run for office because of the critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know if it's worth it and if I'll have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in the wheels and cast doubt on every action I take", explaining why he hesitated.
"A lot of people have told me that I shouldn't quit because they'd quit too".
"It's a trust I can't betray", he said.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"For the last two years there has been a great deal of work done and I do not want to let it go".
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them", he said, fearing that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union would return to the way it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and that's something Mirek Pelta can't do".
"Behind him are people who would make football so that it would be only for the chosen".
"I may be blamed for a number of things but I am certainly not to endure any".
"I try to be objective".
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy not just the chosen ones
And he confirms again that he would only be a president for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do the maximum for Moravia".
"For example, it is time to consider the second division being divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, whose winners would be in the first division".
"There would not be a situation like today with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is finding young players.
Since Tomas Paclik, the president of the Club of Plzen, entered the competition for the post of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I feel the support of the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes", said Rajchl, who is looking to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiations on contracts with television and on the gambling law.
He says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault.
While he says of Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him Czech football would lose its credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
"No one can doubt in Plzen that he did a great job this year".
"If he were elected he would surely continue what Hasek started and would not make any noticeable change among the people in the Commissions".
"He wouldn't want to waste his successes", said Rajchl, who assessed his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
A leap into the blue

Budapest's magnificent swimming pools and unseen cobblestones: Travellers can experience the blue wonder of Europe - and after a tour of the city or a long walk - can rest their tired legs in sparkling water baths.
A book shows which pool you can experience the most well-being in.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip for the last 18 months, there was one item that should not be missing from her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she watched the artfully arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that were waiting for her on the other side of the pool and couldn't help but marvel at the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If she liked a covered pool, she would write in her notebook all the interesting details about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been surveyed in this way by architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden" (Bath Joies).
She has led her "tours to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries.In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of the culture of the bath.
Meder, explains that she doesn't have much interest in sports but he feels attracted to the water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that swimming fans have to settle for blue tiles and the stench of bleached water while joggers breathe the enchanting scent of spicy forests or can listen to the chirping of joyful birds in the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools must always be so ugly", said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths".
The water surface doubles the architecture
A dip in a pool and the sauna oils - the well-being factor in the swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders had put in a little more effort, the swimming pools could be a real eye-catcher: "Instead of a floor, we have a surface of water in the swimming pools".
"It is transparent on one side, but on the other side it reflects the beauty of the whole building".
All surfaces are visually presented in two ways: high vaults, multi-colored tiles, trampolines.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to take a leap into the blue.
Collector Meder discovered some remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
Alongside splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing waters in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose pools are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
The outdoor heated pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, offer spectacular views of the city, while the snow-capped Arlberg can be seen from the roof of the bath in Zurich, and the outdoor pool in St. Anton has a window that allows you to see the action on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the Ötztal mountains rise to the sky.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of bleach doesn't come from every pool in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths give off a sulfur smell, the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba gives off a strong petroleum smell, which is hard to believe, to be in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing hydrogen carbonate that are almost black and its slime sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
Iris Meder's search for beautiful pools also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in a barricaded area.
The bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed.
Looking out of the window of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she observed the weeds growing between the tiles.
She observed the opposite effect in a lovely swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Bad Wildbad Spa Palace.
The building has already survived three phases; not only can one discover neo-Roman elements that have come out since its design in 1844 but also an Alhambra-style Moorish room that was added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of pool expert Iris Meder - and not just because she is from the Black Forest.
"It is a fine achievement to combine such different building styles into such a formidable unit", says Meder.
With such a palace, a dip in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail commodity speculation
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank give up its speculation in commodities?
SPIEGEL-ONLINE reports that Ackermann has commissioned a task force to study the effects of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the leader of the group wants to draw the consequences.
- Hamburg - What is it ?
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the situation is clear: according to a survey, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on commodities such as maize and wheat.
Two thirds of the people surveyed even demand that German banks and other lending institutions stop doing this because it adds to the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa investigation into the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of the stock exchanges on global commodities, pushes prices up and that the banks share a complicity in the world famine.
The consumer protection campaign is aligned in practice against the head of Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Speculation on commodities was originally introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But most experts now agree that the gamblers have become detached from supply and demand - and profit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to the criticism differently from the American competitors: He promised to investigate the reproaches and said, "no business is worth risking the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations made by Foodwatch-Report.
The review is to be completed by the end of the year, after which the results of the review are to be presented to the board of directors of Deutsche Bank - usually with recommendations.
At the end of January, the head of the bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction of the raw material market or even a complete abandonment of the market.
Ackermann builds his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The speculation on rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how badly the banks of today are hurting the public interest".
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be particularly restricted today.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all investments for which money has been invested in food speculation", Bode said.
"It doesn't matter to Mr. Ackermann whether it's about the hungry people or whether the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake".
Ackermann's realization may at first sight seem surprising, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving his duties.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything in the Board of Directors' plans.
It could improve its brand image with a break from controversial agricultural speculation.
And any losses he might have, he doesn't have to worry about that - his successor will take care of it.
One in two would terminate their commodity investments.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the Manager.
So far more than 30,000 netizens have already joined the campaign of the organization.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires on 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 11 per cent thought it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which food prices bets are made.
Many of the bank's customers would also be personally affected if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one in two would, following the survey, terminate all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43 per cent would advise others not to use such a bank, 49 per cent said they would consider closing their account in order to change banking institution.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
♪ I'm not sure ♪
A story of architecture with highs, lows and a happy ending: the Austrian pavilion for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
Now it is open again and serves as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about post-war modern architecture, for its clear forms, glass hangars, bold and vivid layouts and new building materials which are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the Universal Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its lightweight, suspended steel and glass construction.
The building is considered to this day an important milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, he also built the Pavilion for the following Austrian Universal Exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and its adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the Universal Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum -- no walls to hang the art, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for a long time, until the contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has become increasingly dilapidated.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opened its first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every way.
The new departure was carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvédère in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as a figure skater, then at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, she has particularly carried out transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, she has obtained public and private funding and established the exploitation.
Apart from contemporary art, works by the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a café and a bookshop are located there, and an office is to be built there.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the film, Krischanitz was the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and sensibly enlarged the Secession of Joseph Olbracht and won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen the exhibitions "practically every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness following its move to Vienna and by its change of use.
The current transformation had major problems: the building was "an energy sinkhole", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced with fibreglass was laid and the roof replaced with special safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges were strengthened or replaced, and the asbestos-filled roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new farm, a dimmed light panel between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in a red-brown rust-protective shade.
And the movie theater is exactly the same as it was before.
And all of this under the close supervision of the monument authorities and on a small budget.
"Often good and cheap materials were to be found, and these also please the office of monument protection", says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the stresses, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City" story.
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and yet it wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the 21st century house is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of luck of urban construction: around the Jardin Suisse stands precisely the "quarter of the central station" just newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck may be happening: the 21st century house could benefit from the addition of another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the temporary art center in Berlin, and as it is said, she is already negotiating with the city to get a site in the neighborhood of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan to prevent train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, the railway company Deutsche Bahn will spend over 70 million extra this year.
The daily Bild-Zeitung reported earlier, citing an internal crisis plan at the group, that investments totalling about EUR 300 million were planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for snow removal at railway and wharf installations is expected to double to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the berths of snow and ice by the start of the service phase and to have 90% of the track equipment needed for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the station manager Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a summit conference about train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had enormous problems with passenger transport, because it lacked, among other things, reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had to do this for years, since it has had to have the axles of ICE trains checked much more frequently at the workshop after an axle break occurred on an ICE in Cologne Central Station.
The German bank Deutsche Bank is paying millions in penalties to the US.
After the case of the boss Josef Ackermann there is news in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if Deutsche Bank's problems were not enough, the sector giant's past is catching up with it in the US: the Frankfurt institute is paying a comparison of $145 million (€106 million) to settle a dispute over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage documents.
The financial market regulator NCUA has accused the big banks of a whole series of charges, including that they have encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks down.
"We are pleased that we were able to find a solution to this without the parties having to go to court", said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The Bank did not admit any misconduct in comparison.
This is also true for Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions from the two banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the cooperative banks of the USA and it intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair billions of dollars in damage.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took on other big banks and in the summer it took JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs to court.
The issue of mortgage-backed securities is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
The credit houses are the foundation.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a lot of corporate banks.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events date back a few years, a storm is now blowing on the American banks.
Investors and supervisors have brought numerous actions to obtain redress or to punish wrongdoers.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks, and the two US government-owned real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of having taken advantage in cash in mortgage transactions of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to lodge an appeal with the FHFA, in respect of several transactions totalling USD 14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities demand that Frankfurter be held responsible for "substantial losses" but without specifying a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and stated that it would defend itself.
Warren Buffett is raising $10 billion at IBM.
Buffett, the financial guru, is investing a lot of money in IBM's IT business.
Since March, he's bought more than ten billion dollars worth of stock.
Until then, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always said not to invest in IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only shows bad forecasts.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed his mind about investing in this sector.
He must have understood much earlier that IBM mainly provides services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a chivalrous attack in the world of finance.
The IT division of IBM therefore now has the right to call itself "Mr IBM".
Because Buffett revealed today on CNBC's "Economics" show that he has bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM stock since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway became a major shareholder in IBM with a 5.5% stake.
Buffett said IBM never knew about the commitment until now.
He commended the management, which even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable profits.
"You did a great job", Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been betting on profitable IT services as a business for some time as a way of operating accounting centres.
The computer pioneer, which is over 100 years old, offers software and consulting services as well as high-performance business computers.
Buffett had so far mostly avoided tech companies.
He says he only invests in companies he understands the business of.
But instead, Buffett's more focused on rail freight, lubricant manufacturers, machinery manufacturers.
His Berkshire Hathaway holding company has nearly 80 subsidiaries and shares in a whole range of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Rück munich.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built it into one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to smart investments.
Yet, his life style is modest.
That's why he's a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His near-perfect sense of how to make money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After Buffett's investment announcement, IBM shares rose one percent on the stock exchange.
Big Blue, as IBM is also known, has a total market value of over $220 billion and ranks with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn't want any part of it.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubts the German rule of law.
One newspaper even spoke of a "bloody ideology" that is now being revived.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek business in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and anxiety.
For many German-Turks the spectre that was long thought dead has reappeared: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to this extreme right-wing context against the Turks.
There is xenophobia in Germany, but it has never been mentioned.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology", was the headline of the Turkish daily "Haberturk" online edition.
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, points out that one of the authors was a man from the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire.
The Turkish community in Germany has reacted in a reasonable way by calling for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence at the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
It was only two weeks before that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
The cohabitation was staged in cheerful colours, symbolizing a success story.
Reports from some Turkish media have a slap in the face: "Germany's 50th birthday gift" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriyet therefore draws from it some unambiguous conditions.
"It starts at birth", is the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
He points out that people were allegedly murdered, paid taxes and through their work made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The police action was very critically perceived on the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently discussed the success of their search.
Why did it not occur to the German authorities much earlier to investigate certain suspected far-right circles, the authors wonder.
Many are prepared to resort to rhetorical or even drastic measures: "If the case continues to be neglected, the migrants will have nothing left but self-defence and armament".
"that will be the best self-defense".
"Inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the whole network", writes "Selen".
What this means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, what distrust and distance through acts of violence could lead to.
The attacks, however, have heightened the sense of hostility in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past it was mainly the failure of German policy after the attacks, which the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how many taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if a man's value could be gauged by the amount of his tax liabilities.
The current report from the Turkish media shows once again how deeply distrusted many German-Turks have been with the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to efforts to clarify and reassess the issue of right-wing extremism in Germany, a clear message is needed.
The scandal bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and it's been skating from crisis to crisis.
It's a German who has to lead now.
It's certainly not what Axel Weber had in mind.
After his spectacular departure from the Bundesbank, it was revealed in July that he would take on an almost as spectacular position in 2013: Chairman of the Board of the Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly celebrated Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity and made pleasant remarks about future colleagues.
"UBS has made the Turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the bank's security systems and swindled about 1.7 billion euros.
The chairman of the board of directors of UBS, Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the UBS board has been considered sick for some time - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally return?
We have already heard that Weber can be a bank adviser from February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman of the board in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it is becoming difficult.
He's not a banker, much more an economics professor and bank president, and he certainly would have needed a period of adjustment.
He then suddenly assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank which has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of 'Europe's biggest scandal bank'.
Indeed, UBS is on one side huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating from scandal to scandal for years.
Nothing seems to spare the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, quiet and solid, but also cunning, was combined with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become a very large bank in the field of investment banking.
So UBS on the one hand hand hand handled $1.6 billion more money from wealthy customers in 2007 than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had moved up as an investment bank into the league of the world's largest banks.
It made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger, who later taught banking for many years in Zurich, says: "I always took UBS as a model of good banking for my students".
"In the current world, we're asking ourselves, how could I have been so wrong?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared for the first time that something was not right at UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli, who had hitherto been regarded as a leading intellectual and a brilliant banker, unexpectedly retired.
A few months later we got a feeling of why he had left.
The bank division had been burned with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross of billions.
To supplement this, UBS announced a capital increase of CHF 13 billion and made a mark on it.
It has indeed found investors for this, but not long before they would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund, which was kept silent, to the point that we never even heard its name.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank was again to report billions in losses, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe followed: UBS was, due to its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the State.
The national bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was shocked - for it noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to harbor such large banks.
Finally, the 2007 balance sheet total of UBS was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We have failed to save UBS once again", says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second followed.
A few months before, UBS had already capitulated to a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of wealthy clients, who had cheated the tax perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has agreed to pay $780 million in unjustified profits from these transactions, plus a fine.
So UBS pretty much publicized that it had helped with the tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition with wealthy clients: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was never the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of the money of the clients.
Thus, in a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: investment banking because of bad speculation and asset management because of aid to tax fraud.
And, as there was a bit of a return to calm, and as it was thought, that UBS would get away with it, followed by this unfortunate story of securities dealers: a single securities dealer flames 1.7 billion euros, before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And they publish: with risk management in investment banking it still doesn't seem to work.
"In the Adoboli case, we found that the control of risk has changed too little", says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a major German bank is convinced that "the problem with UBS is that it does not have control of the risks".
However, it was exactly the idea of prudence with which the Swiss bankers had long taken up their function, that of becoming the guardian of the world's great fortune: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasuries of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the solid cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
It's a classic situation.
The Bank is based at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the central station to Lake Zurich, itself surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss Alps.
The buildings here are prestigious, and the rents of the shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's, you can find them here among the Swiss tradition shops as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse Palace to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
We enter the lobby of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank's logo, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has at some point or another led to market failure - or betrayal of the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, after all like all Swiss bankers he also does business with the two big banks.
The UBS had become too big, he said - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had become more prevalent.
The Swiss would have no say in it.
"And yet they have long since adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways".
It was the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed UBS, made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the great Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the coalition government of the small country of seven million people has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen ?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three largest Swiss banks joined together to form a huge group.
A bank was set up, which was already too big for the small Switzerland - and it kept growing.
What helped was that the two different predecessors of UBS were complemented: a rich but sluggish bank with its strong asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more strongly internationalised bank.
Suddenly, the international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they could spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS group, and Marcel Ospel, former chairman of the board of directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team", says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great intellectual, who is modest and well versed in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who worked his way to the top with the apprenticeship of the bank".
But Ospel would have trusted Wuffli to the end.
And Wufli would have probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were reality", says Geiger.
"This is a tragic fall".
Tragic, perhaps, but not for long.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The staff at UBS clearly remembers the executive meetings at which the head of the Wuffli Group always used the same slogan: to dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commissioned the "League Tables" rankings, which documented the banks' success at that time.
After all, UBS wanted to go all the way.
Some of the steps he's already taken have been successful.
In the field of foreign exchange and securities transactions it has played a very important role.
The corporate advisors, who had the responsibility for this, pointed out, however, a weakness: in international interest rate operations, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
UBS is said to have shortcomings in US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its life.
The bank itself and a management fund set up before it invested in the American sub-prime investments.
It has become a massive machine that has packaged and passed the securities based on American mortgages - but it has also retained risk.
Even when other banks have been trying to get down for a long time.
"Still in the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was in flames, UBS bought there", says Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more abrupt the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when it proved more difficult than expected to stop the attempts.
Some positions at UBS have become ejectable and are still vacant.
The man who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He has to come up with a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to investment banking, to concentrate on asset management, to return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not want to go that far (yet).
But the investment bank must be vigorously reduced, as far as is clear so far.
Next Thursday, the head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank unexpectedly split from his predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has won the day: he must run UBS's business on a lasting basis, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of the art in the mid-1990s.
He's cutting 3,500 jobs.
But that won't do.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she ?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber has certainly asked himself.
He has only said publicly so far that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
I'll see you next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe this weekend has discouraged American investors.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The continent's stagnant industrial output has stifled hopes of stabilization in the debt crisis in its infancy.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens was not to be felt.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was only half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems are once again in the forefront, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
Mostly the financial values were on the sales sheets.
The default values of the Dow-Jones-Index recorded a loss of about 0.6% at the close of the markets to 12.078 points.

American investors were sceptical: "We are not an island, but dependent", said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from the banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do anything to end the crisis", he said in an interview with CNBC.
As a result, it was too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle to the wind and entered the American tech industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM has supported the stock price of this traditional group, and allowed it to score almost more than 1%, against the trend of commercial management.

Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, frogs are considered a "bird problem", but experts say that these highly intelligent animals have not been hunted out of cities for a long time.
Some people like them, others want to get rid of them as soon as possible.Crows have been part of the city for centuries, but in many communities residents' complaints are mounting over the filth and noise of the animals.
An antidote for the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first Ostfriesisch Symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to drive the hornets out of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They look for alternatives in the cities
The environmentalists also based the problems of the cities on the exodus of specially protected species: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional living spaces.
Hunting, development, and the cutting down of typical nesting trees made life difficult for the birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with over 600 breeding pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project gained negative publicity because of the carnage of crows in this region.
Critics found the trapping of birds in traps and their killing with gourdons particularly brutal.
"The normal eviction, the eviction, is useless", said Leer's town and country planner Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests by pressurized water or by felling trees often has unintended consequences, said environmentalist Manfred Kaiser of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals are moving away, the large colonies are splitting up and they are scattering to other places".
The removal is only imaginable in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them".
The problem cannot be solved in the cities without including the periphery, according to the mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
A combination of eviction of animals with aversive packaging and attractive offers is acceptable, in order to allow them to re-settle elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens looked for "information boards instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better tolerate a bump on the face with a dose of self-confidence".
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-Sandwich-Educational-Sandwich in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent freaks.
This project has since been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise made by birds: "There is a great deal of communication, these birds have a lot to say".
The intelligence and skill of the animals is legendary: The Freys not only use tools to get a treat but they make their own tools as tools.
Ethologists at Cambridge University recently tested four ways in which birds can be intelligent.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring down a scaffold with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they determined that a stone had to have a certain size and shape to cause the platform to collapse.
In a second test, the cunning crows were then asked to solve a more difficult problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with their beaks.
However, the researchers had placed pieces of wire at their disposal.
All four of them formed a hook with which they would fish the little bucket of the little pipe.
Three out of four tricks are even successful from the start.
Cristiano Ronaldo is leading Portugal to the 2012 European Championship
Hopes of a Bosniak-Turkish coup remained unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the qualifiers for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and knocked out Ukraine.

Ronaldo has a free kick 30 yards ahead in the grid.
A good 15 minutes later, Nani showed his range shooting skills and fired from a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half hour had accomplished nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to striker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship of Manchester City initiated a head ball directed to the bottom of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33e).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally, the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding is the center of attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the penalty of Bosnia, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese (36th) the yellow card.
On the other side, Stark awarded a controversial 11-yard penalty after Fabio Coentrao's action that Misimovic surely diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 European runner-up made four strokes and it all became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champion will be going to the European Championships for the fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), was also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last minute goal by Tomas Sivok potentials (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the cross had to come to the rescue of the already downed Czech world-class goalkeeper, again, the FC Seoul striker had been replaced (50th).
The goal just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb during this time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb couldn't go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink had to give up his place on the bench for the 2002 European Championship, the Croats were able to celebrate their fourth round in the European Championship final.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost made up for a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the post, striker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't leave anything to burn.
The German team was also able to win the match against the German team, but the German team was not able to win the match.
Trapattoni participates in the EM

Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) was the guest of honour.
Ireland pushed at top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Los Angeles Galaxy's Robbie Keane was given the first chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian defence prevent a possible goal from the -first scorer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After a fruitless defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was within reach and caught the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the next few years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Up to 2015, about two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees accordingly", CEO Bill McDermott announced to his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The number of employees will increase from about 2,500 to 4,500.

The Mass Killing of the Individual
Peter Englund's new book is deep and generous, and it's called "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War", and it opens with a long list of characters that make you cringe.
A tip to start with: carefully tear this page and make it your bookmark.
In this novel by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the fog of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he accurately describes as "anti-historical".
It contains a few well-known names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are hardly any ambassadors or discussions of strategies and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, but a "book about what it could be like" and it contains "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and the Sorrow" sums up the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, from both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, paramedics and salesmen.
Some of them will become heroes.
Some will lose limbs, go insane, or lose their lives.
Their lives are wavering here like the candles of a church: as some are extinguished, new ones are being rekindled.
Peter Englund's book deviates from the traditional history books.
It refutes the idea that World War I was merely a terrible trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and the Sorrow" aptly describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under beehives; one is spending Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades these people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When gunshots are heard in the distance, and you are a stay-at-home mother, do you stay or run?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
Englund writes, "the lack of facts has been compounded by speculation, hope, fear, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"Beauty and the Sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
Their versions of life can be terrifying or exciting, but are best preserved by the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them deal with deprivation and the ability to cope.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz".
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons" - that's what I thought.
He's pursuing the alternative food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from cooked rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a fake wooden bone); tobacco made from dried potato roots and skin; wooden shoe soles".
He states that "837 authorized meat substitutes are registered in sausage production.
Some stories are about honor and courage.
A U.S. man acknowledges his own drive for savagery and says of war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were meant to be, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair with a cigarette and a whiskey in your hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and pretending that such a veneer is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no savage behind your thick, stubby shirt.
On the other hand, a British soldier realizes that he is in danger of dying, and no one will notice or pay attention to him.
"When you are resigned to sacrifice yourself, you hope to have an audience", he wrote.
Unfortunately, it is more like "a condemned man strangled in secret".
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is increasingly becoming a story of economic competition", writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories".
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the turn of the century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-fitting clothes, who carries out his butchery while sitting behind a counter".
People act in unexpected ways; there are as many basic behaviors as there are heroic ones.
Peter Englund tells of soldiers who tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes at any cost in order to avoid service at the front.
"The most grotesque expression is found in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital", he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to their eyes, resulting in blindness for life".
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is supple but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures how the war "triggered forces that were entirely uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, social revolution, anti-religion".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are waging war against them.
The best books dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's Great War and Modern Memory, or Erich Maria Remarque's Nothing New in the West, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The ending of the book is the most overwhelming ending I've ever read in a work of non-fiction.
I won't tell.
But it's as if he's emerged from his book, holding in your hands that page with the list of people and burning it with a match.
After a first misstep, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night between Monday and Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers and others who had been informed from the beginning that they were going to conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repetition of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which went against the department's rules and generated a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clear Zuccotti Park of its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the occupation in other cities.
A major drill has been organized on Randall Island, in preparation for the Zuccotti Park operation.
Police officers are receiving better riot training - counterterrorism measures that involve moving large numbers of police officers quickly - to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session was Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move into the park came "at the last minute", said one regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few police officers I know who were called did not know they would be going to Zuccotti Park", said the person, who asked not to be named.
"The only people who knew they were going to the police station were the top brass in the police department".
The city learned a lesson, hence the secrecy of the operation.
On October 14th, police officers attempted to clean up the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters who were informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including task forces from across the neighborhood - dozens of officers accustomed to particularly crime-ridden neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that many people were coming and going to the park during the day, like migrants, so 1 a.m. was a good time.
"It was appropriate to do this when the park had the least number of people", he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with spotlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages from loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue windshields, many of the protesters simply packed up their belongings and left.
No tents were hit until 1:45 a.m., police said, which gave the occupants time to gather their belongings.
Other police teams were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Some journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the chief of the police department, said that this measure was taken purely for security reasons.
But according to many journalists, the police prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, which was severely restrained by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the TV cameras on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved westward through the thick littered trash of protesters, including luggage, plastic grass and leafy bags full of clothes, crews from the sanitation department followed, cleaning up whatever the occupiers left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged, and the images were posted online shortly after.
The main group of protesters took up position near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
About ten people at the epicenter of the camp cling together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services have been called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park before 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleanup operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Mostly for "disturbing public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the police department, was the highest ranking officer on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr Kelly, although present, "was not running the operations", Mr Browne said.
A second group of officers stood along the east side of the park between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of a need for intervention.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, to the south.
We saw the police expand the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them armed with shields, were reportedly seen pushing people away.
About 28 people were on the north side.
One of the night's most vivid action took place in the southern part of the park.
At approximately 5:00 a.m. on South Pine Street, one protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen slashing the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood came out of the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protester were hospitalized.
The school-assist union is suing the city for redundancies.
The union that represents hundreds of school aides who lost their jobs last month plans to file a lawsuit Wednesday against the city for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals, the impact of which is disproportionate on schools that serve disadvantaged students.
Lawsuits are probably the ultimate weapon the 37th District Council uses to try to get the layoffs reversed.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other low-paid employees in the city lost their jobs on October 7. Union leaders likened the firings to political revenge for not allowing the city access to a health care fund run by worker groups that would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The city authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget that closed in June.
One Council member countered that the dismissals of teaching assistants were not specified in the budget.
Council officials from the 37th District said they would file a notice of claim, warning the education department that it would be sued; a press conference will be held Wednesday to formally announce the lawsuits in Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's education department will be the defendants, and the plaintiffs will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all of whom are black or Hispanic, as are most of the school aides who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city has not yet seen the reasons for the lawsuit and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by The New York Times, the union would bet on the number of layoffs in the city's poorest neighborhood schools to support its grievance against unfair treatment, saying that the poorest schools would lose the most aid because of a steady underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and only a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aides have lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of eight teaching assistants employed at Harlem Public School 36, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuits claim that "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can bring in funds to fill the budget gap".
The budget for Public School 36 was cut by 3.26% this year, and funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrolled.
The union also claims that school principals may have been misled by some terms in a memo authorizing the firing of parent coordinators.
The memo used the term "transfer" to describe the action, although "transfer" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a pool of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the complaint draft, "sixty-six parent coordinators were fired", and "not just for overwork".
Mission accomplished: Congress reaches agreement on Libya
It appears that Republicans and Democrats have finally reached an agreement on the Libyan uprising.
It will have taken a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is due to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (D-Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (R-Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut) applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is about honoring the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country", said John Kerry.
"It's bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations".
The language may be innocuous but the debate on Libya has never been simple until now.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties clashed, as well as the White House, over the wording of several resolutions to approve or disapprove the U.S. military role in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and never went to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure to cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
So the US mission remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress was upset enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The Congress' indecision has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell to the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution "commends the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "commends the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their fantastic courage and professionalism".
The resolution also affirmed "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new measure win full support from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or will it divide lawmakers as it did last June?
Senator Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version of the bill.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest draft of the new bill.
Inside the Capitol, the House is expected to vote this week on a constitutional amendment to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, backed by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), would be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to get a floor vote in either the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments through, but they have tried.
The Goodlatte Amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in Congress, on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed to both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations of a previous one.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of the balanced budget amendment alone, and a handful that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but give their backers - especially the new Republicans who want to gild their CVs - a chance to brag about being the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed last August required the House and Senate to vote on the budget amendment to be balanced.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wanted to limit the number of terms for which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (D-NY) wanted to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) proposed a host of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment banning flag desecration.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be struck down if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
As eager as members have been to propose amendments, they are not as quick as in the past.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 in the 110th Congress.
The pace is slowing down from the early 1990s, when members typically proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures from the Senate Library.
But those amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacred but not beaten", says Gabrielle Giffords in her first televised interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at point-blank range in Tucson, Arizona, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-A) appeared on a Monday night television show, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to get better rather than return to Congress.
When she appeared on ABC's "20/20" alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show covered his difficult comeback from the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, through the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprise return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling bill.
In her first televised interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied "quite well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special one-hour edition of "20/20", aired the day before the release of the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special show traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting on January 8th.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, he is seen lying on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on his forehead.
She can use only one or two fingers, with her husband's encouragement.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair as doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A nod of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What".
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to request a change in her breakfast menu.
ABC videos show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: the Representative is seen singing along with the doctors the Cyndi Lauper tune "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'?".
In the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours a day with the doctors, said she had no recollection of the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for the first time about the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri jail and being vigorously treated pending trial.
"There were many deaths", Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard" is the way to go.
When she recovered, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten".
"So I would say, 'Gabby, you haven't been beaten,'" said Mark Kelly.
You just got slaughtered.
And you're gonna get through it, and you're gonna get better and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for New York City's homeless veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness and frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines around him.
The suit-and-tie crowd stood at his feet to cheer him on.
"The military men and women are considered heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military official at the gala, which also included Admiral Mike Mullen, the chief of staff of the United States Armed Forces, saw the role of troops differently.
"They were presented as a kind of orphan", the senior military officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know you do.
But it wasn't respect, it was pity.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the strained relationships that have developed between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they do have a price, say some military personnel.
The public is acting more and more like they're sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support ourselves is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky spirits".
This is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who don't want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the returning troops from the Vietnam War was much worse.
So, most conversations about compassion take place in the privacy of veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would view their service in two ways.
Some would look at them with respect because they've faced insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others might wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface", said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some of the people who were doing the interviews were subtly asking if he would be able to cope with the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after returning from combat.
"When you bring up the subject of service, you are confronted with negative impressions", recalls Colonel Cancian when speaking to his sons.
The military's difficulties arise, in part, from American indifference to war.
Victories are rarely celebrated by a country so unfamiliar with the military and who sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way we did in World War II", says retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise from politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of a soldier's suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
Army faces growing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a landmark hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will sue the military for alleged inaction over rape.
If necessary, hundreds of plaintiffs will prepare the next one.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims she was raped by a soldier.
It was October 2008, and she was walking back to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague who was carrying a case of beer.
He asked her if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It was a wake-up call", says Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texan put her worry aside.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas", she said.
"I should have followed my gut".
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her to the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some on duty and some off duty, will anxiously await the outcome of a historic court case in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether a trial of former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of failing to stop the widespread rape within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The suit, initially filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all of whom claimed to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and also claimed that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says she's going after the military for being too forward, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure", she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
The lawyer also states that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be involved in future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of bringing all the plaintiffs into the case - thus putting all her eggs in one basket - she will bring several lawsuits, if necessary, to keep the pressure on.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense's strategy, and essentially the fact that the military cannot be sued by active or retired soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for injuries suffered by active duty personnel.
"The alleged wrongdoing is inherent in the complainants' military service", the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not have the right to go to war, this distinction is only written on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely exclusively male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in getting in touch with local women.
As a result, in those two wars, 150 female soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in combat.
It's time for the military to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight. Three other cases are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynist atmosphere.
On the other hand, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on diagnoses of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to discharge them - a relatively common occurrence, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the way they processed benefits claims for people who reported having been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine separate bills were introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, there were 3,158 sexual assault cases reported by the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, because according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The March report also looks at the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases recorded in the military were prosecuted - half the percentage in the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Susan Burke case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she notifies the MPD of the rape within an hour of the rape.
That night, she said, she was asked to give 11 detailed accounts of her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She was raped, and her attacker's blood - from a cut on her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat in front of a judge at a trial during which she was questioned about her sexual relationship with her boyfriend earlier in the day of her assault.
Six people testified as moral witnesses for the perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down", says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to have contractions, so I started screaming at the court".
"I was put in a psychiatric unit, and when I came out, I remember telling my commanding officer, 'This was not his trial, it was mine.'"
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed on less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the Lyman and other plaintiffs' case will go forward is a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law.
However, he remarked, "In my opinion, they should be able to move on".
Only this doctrine, which has been criticized since its introduction, stands between them and a verdict.
I've always been critical of the Feres doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it doesn't have the same benefits and deterrents that accountability entails.
"The odds are heavily against them... but it's important that they try", he adds.
Those things only change when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the case doesn't go to trial, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will be bringing her hundreds of other plaintiffs together for further trials.
"We will continue to fight against the military on this issue until there is no reform", she said.
Where until we die, one or the other of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just a guy sharing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to being caught in a murderous rampage in Norway in July that left 77 people dead, faced his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being in cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, chatting with a few million nationalists who support far-right groups on social networking sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers are eager to learn more about these people.
But how can we find them?
Easy... log in to your Facebook.
"We realised that it was not that hard to find them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by the DEMOS thinktank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they're looking for with scientific precision - the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe, and they targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to take a survey, asking questions about their level of education, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
By connecting with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way of doing research", says Jamie Bartlett.
Some of the results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens".
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new go-to tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all the subjects that touch health issues as well as social trends, through "Likes", wall posts and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, the "data supernova" is generating an explosion in search, increasing the number of research papers whose name appears in the headline by almost 800% over the past five years.
Some researchers say the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you wouldn't be able to reach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to do surveys on people in the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never let you in", says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all of that - you have direct access to their information".
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and treat health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues, young students who talked about their achievements on Facebook while drunk were significantly more likely to be alcoholics than students who were quiet about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status would be too often about alcohol.
"You can't treat a problem if you don't diagnose it", says Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We know how to identify children at risk, who would otherwise be unrecognized".
Facebook also constantly accesses its users' information.
The site's data team studied statistics on love life and Valentine's Day, the turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a national happiness index (using only available information - champions of digital freedom have long argued that the site could make its treasure trove of data available to others for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey that they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines for how to gather information other than via the Internet, it is a different story online.
"I don't think a lot of users have ever thought about a researcher studying their profile", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, referring to a 2006 study he conducted of his students' Facebook walls.
"As far as they knew, the exchanges were only seen by their friends".
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even without going online, there's no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in real life are two totally different things", says Neil Selwyn.
So despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks a notebook and a pen are still the best tools you can use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people", he says.
"Social studies are supposed to be about social - and social is not about computer".
"Cold and Inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two bombings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars", he told a courtroom full of 500 people.
"As for the court's jurisdiction, I reject it because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism".
"I admit the facts but I do not plead guilty".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during his monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions".
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, speak to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for an additional 12 weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to be sure he would be put behind bars.
All of them attended the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman", said a survivor of Utoya to Norwegian TV channel NRK.
"I was not comfortable, but I personally advanced a little after seeing and hearing the suspect".
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, looking reporters and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the courtroom.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belonged to a large "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not insane and also stated that there was no evidence that he was acting with accomplices.
The attacks of July 22 seem to be the work of one extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not lessen the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but it doesn't", said a relative of one victim.
"It would have been a lot easier".
7 lessons from the lost Steve Jobs interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some have likened him to Henry Ford - distinguished as the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in a recently discovered interview with Steve Jobs that will be released this week as the first part of a movie in major markets, is how much this creative mind had understood about the product's processes and workflow.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer, identifying himself as a hippie but also as a very meticulous and organized, as well as a chart-improving man - a man who believed that many business executives suffered from a "disease that made them think that a brilliant idea does 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual labor separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the TV series "Triumph of the Nerds", which traced the birth of the computer, and he sat down for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aiming for a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies were lost in the shipment.
It wasn't until after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video was found in the director's garage.
This slightly edited video is the basis of the 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released in theaters next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about expounding on technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs weighs his thoughts clearly, in order to provide a precise answer.
We also find moments where Steve Jobs' perfectionism resurfaces, where he seems eager to hear Cringely's questions, giving him elbows to get him to speed up and move on to questions or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, the iPod, the iPhone, there's a strangely prescient aspect to Lost Interview, where Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good and bad about other companies and shares his own vision for the future of computing.
It's one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then immediately applies them.
Here's a quick recap of seven remarkable sequences from Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
"All these years I've been asking, 'Why do you do things?' and the answer is always the same: 'Oh, just because you have to do them.'"
Nobody knows why, nobody thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs goes on to give details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how costs were recorded - one often starts with a "standard cost" assessed at face value, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that guaranteed accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a trick on the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device used to hack into phone networks and make free long-distance phone calls.
The device has been the subject of much writing beforehand, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public telephone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We would wrap the ball around different things half a dozen times and you'd scream into the pay phone and it would come to you a minute later on the next pay phone", Jobs explains with a laugh.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world".
We didn't know much about anything, but we were able to invent something small that could control big things, and it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Steve Jobs goes on to tell of a wonderful trick he and Wozniak came up with: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night posing as Henry Kissinger and asking to speak to the Pope.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go on a rampage of laughter just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett's outing):
At the age of 12, while hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he looked up Bill Hewlett's number in the yearbook and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my definition of a company and the way employees are treated".
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed".
It was the size of a suitcase, had a little cathode ray tube in it, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On improvising with innovation:
Several times in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a whim.
Early in his career, as he was settling down to sell a few printed circuit boards, he was asked by a client to assemble a complete computer.
Working on only 30 days' credit, he had to take care of the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later, at Apple, he recalled the difficulties he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big fights... people were yelling at me that it would take me five years [to make a $300 mouse]. I got tired, I went out and I went to a designer".
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that turned out to be incredibly reliable.
About the big companies that are out of breath:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had foreseen the way many industry leaders would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
"Suppose you worked at IBM or Xerox, you made a better copier or a better printer, what next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing can drive it, so [these are the types of people] who end up running the companies and the product-specific staff are left out of the decision-making.
The product engineering that has led to this monopoly position is completely corrupted by people who can't imagine designing a good product versus a bad product - the manual labor required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been 10 times bigger than it is now.
They took defeat for victory.
On innovation as an art form:
"A huge amount of manual labor separates a brilliant idea from an outstanding product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows".
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are trade-offs to be made... some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) as you put them together.
And finally, the decisions are made by personal taste, and it's about trying to expose you to the best products that humans have created, and trying to bring those things into the product that you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal.
We're always ashamed to steal great ideas.
And that's part of what makes the Macintosh exceptional, because the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who just happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dining with health care law opponents as the court convenes
On the day the Supreme Court is sitting in camera to consider the political dissent question of whether opposition to President Obama's health care law will be heard, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were spotted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case in the high court.
The event occurred last Thursday, when the nine justices met for a conference to discuss petitions for review.
One of the cases in question involved a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The justices agreed to hear the complaint, as a monumental 5:30 argument is expected in March, and the outcome is likely to destabilize the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court's decision is rendered.
The lawyer who will be appearing in court and arguing the dismissal of the law is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general of the United States during the George W. Bush administration.
Clément's law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was among two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and a vocal opponent of the health care bill.
The star guests at dinner?
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue from the code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fund-raising events of organizations related to law and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, an honored guest, or appear on the program of such an event".
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two of the law firms in the case, as well as a firm with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
"This breach of ethics and superficial disregard for the code contradicts the claims of several judges that the court follows the same rules that apply to all other federal judges", said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"Judges were drinking and dining and at a fund-raising gala with lawyers who have cases pending in court".
Their presence and participation in the fundraising for this event undermines any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little regard for critics claiming they too easily mixed court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was solicitor general in the Obama administration when the first objections to the law were brought to the trial court level.
Her critics pressured Kagan to recuse herself from the case, saying she had become too invested in the defense of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing has placed a record $18 billion order for airliners .
Emirates Airlines has ordered 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle airliners, with an option to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated to be worth over $1 billion.
It is not unusual for a company to receive an order for 50 of its products.
It is quite another when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the sum of these 50 aircraft reaches the record sum of 18 billion dollars.
Equally amazing is who Boeing got this order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that Middle East airlines will need 2,520 aircraft over the next 20 years, worth a total of $450 billion.
Over the weekend, Boeing reported the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle aircraft.
It was Emirates, the Dubai-based airline, that put out this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow that the airline is also likely to purchase 20 more aircraft, bringing the total order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and passenger convenience.
The value of these six devices is over a billion dollars.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing", said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"These particular clients are of immense value".
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
So not only can they afford these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to the airlines because it represents their most important expense - would not be so detrimental to them since the country would gain money from the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point as these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora reported.
"They have a natural risk cover", he said.
Emirates' order reinforces Boeing's dominance of the wide-body aircraft market and helps to curb the attempt to encroach on Airbus' competitor with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the airshow comes four months after Airbus announced it was postponing the debut of the larger version of the A350, which directly competes with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is delaying its debut to increase its thrust following customer demands for increased load capacity and range.
Shares of the Boeing Company rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of Mexican President clearly defeated in Michoacán election
Luisa Maria Calderon says that drug traffickers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the governorship race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her bid to become the governor of Michoacán in a violent election, and she said Monday that drug traffickers have favored one of her opponents.
Early results indicated Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for the governorship of this western state.
"The intervention of organized crime during the entire voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country", said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview on the Monday after the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election officials... they took over the ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he's organizing his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have been only slightly outnumbered by Calderon, who was leading the polls before Election Day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother's conservative party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who is currently serving as governor, came in third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the initial results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any links to drug traffickers and strongly advised the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence has continued.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates renounced campaigning locally out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections may seem, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year".
BASD urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the eurozone emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would hinder the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the managing director of Manila-based BASD, said the two fastest growing economies in the world should "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) against looking at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and noted that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would avoid a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We're all in this together".
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful", he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent but it is not immune".
"So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them".
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian debt has risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The burgeoning sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that the global economy is about to enter recession, and has prompted calls from major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would channel any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - such as buying bonds from the US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - was offering greater bargaining power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's Minister of Commerce and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy is now suffering from a drop in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unstable", he said.
"We have monumental challenges to meet and we must maintain a high level of growth".
"It is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where are we going to find jobs for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help wealthy Europeans as they face their own significant economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get the 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less, to accept aid to Europe.
"One day they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and go on holiday in the sun and they will have a hard time swallowing it", he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why India's reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek civil servants in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis risked causing "significant repercussions" across Asia.
BASD's forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/12 now faces "risk of loss" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop "rescue plans" to protect themselves from economic upheaval and significant capital outflows.
Pentagon warnings of potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta ramped up pressure on Congress Monday, warning that impending automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to the rallies of civilians.
The Pentagon is already digging into $450 billion in spending cuts for the next decade, but now fears that an additional $600 billion or more in cuts is imminent if Congress fails to reach a spending agreement.
"The impacts of these cuts would be devastating to the department", Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that Congress's failure to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is known as sequestration, would result in 23% cuts as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a large cut, applied so indiscriminately, would render most of our ships and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a vessel - and seriously undermine other modernization efforts", Panetta writes to senators.
"We would also be forced to part with a number of our civilian staff and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal".
"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparedness".
The reductions would eventually affect combat troops, Panetta continued.
"While wartime financing of overseas contingency operations accounts would not be directly affected by the sequestration, wartime efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in core budgets", Panetta warned.
"Contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracting and overseeing contracts that support the war".
"Staff handling salaries would be reduced, causing delays in payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted".
Both senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a sequester on the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed leader of global military power".
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action", the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon upon the publication of Panetta's letter.
"It's not a consequence we can live with, and it's certainly not one we should impose on ourselves".
"Seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it shouldn't have to happen".
Whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly blunt about possible cuts, even as he himself has risen to the top of the Pentagon with years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and the knowledge that he was faced with tough choices.
At a press conference last week, the secretary of defense painted a bleak picture of what could happen - a military with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors".
"This is a squad without bullets".
"This is a fighter plane, with not enough trained pilots".
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission", Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed force, ill-prepared and unable to face potential adversaries".
"De facto, it is inciting aggression".
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further cuts could "generate significant operational risks: delayed response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable assumed risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could go under the knife, including those already tested and some just in the early planning stages.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy's Humvee.
Stopping development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it's a critical step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Spot a Lie
A look at recent headlines reveals just how pervasive deception and lying are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy trading allegations of sexual harassment with multiple women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been accused of perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies have destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, was made an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, none of us who have lived through history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton set in motion by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
There are many reports of cheating on school and college tests.
There have been cases where teachers have given test answers to students in order to get a good look at their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter ?
Studies show that on any given day, you can hear anywhere from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study found that strangers lie to each other three times in the first 10 minutes of their first encounter.
Detecting or spotting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game, like, say, charades, where the goal is to shout, "I got you", cheating detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades from prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research on such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look you in the eye.
They don't always stammer, blush, or fuss.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and hard to uncover.
A trained lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, the micro-expressions of the face, the question formation and the time of response.
I've spent several years examining scientific findings in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge about deception, and it's clear that deception detection is a modern skill that's easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating, or managing.
Good liars are good at reading other people, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men lie more "self-centered" lies while women lie more "other-centered" lies - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you're perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called "establishing the reference data".
This helps to provide a reference point for measuring subsequent changes.
Notice your subject's posture, his laugh, the quality of his voice.
You need to know if someone is normally moving their feet all the time so that you don't make unfair accusations when you see them moving their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for signs of verbal and nonverbal deceptive behavior.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
People who are deluded may freeze their upper body when trying to remember their story, they may point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or present a post-interview relief - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change in posture when all the tough questions are over.
Interviewers often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
So pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson slipped by using the past while pretending his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals may also use distant language: "I did not have sexual relations with this woman... Ms. Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal cues are subtle.
One may use a lot of "wood tongue" in answering a difficult question: "Well... to be honest... if I remember correctly... to my knowledge".
This makes the response perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing the skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding being victimized by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be derailed after the threat of delayed US approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - angering labor unions while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the proposed pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Nebraska Dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the Nebraska Dunes and Ogallala aquifer, vast sources of groundwater.
"This is a real way forward", Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new State Department-commissioned environmental review would likely have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, though officials deny political involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's decision, and expressed his support for it.
The pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do that, he'd have to cross six states.
It's hated by environmentalists, but loved by labor groups, who have staked on the estimated 20,000 jobs tied to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are pushing for legislation to force the removal of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only pose limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the department's inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit from fear.
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle, who engaged in a rampage in the lobby of their Manhattan apartment building, terrified their young daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers", her family said in the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10th last year as stage tech Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher Roseanna, and Genevieve were preparing to take a family trip.
While Kevin Monk went to get the car, Roseanna Monk came down the hallway of their Riverside Boulevard apartment building with their luggage, carrying Genevieve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and laid her daughter down for a while.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter does?' I said 'Yes' and went to get her", she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
"She said to me in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't leave your daughter by the door,'" says Roseanna Monk.
"I said, 'I don't care what you say or think.'
She became furious and started using swear words - the word "and" and the word "and" in a loud voice...
She had a water bottle and started spraying me with water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Genevieve became hysterical.
"I told that woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the child's mother said.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother - who was still holding Genevieve in her arms - and had to be restrained by her entourage who dragged her to a waiting car, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl cried so hard that she started vomiting, she added.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
Lawyer and LaBelle representatives haven't returned our calls for comment.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money received to a children's cancer charity.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct", said Mr Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child".
The economic impact of the adverse climate
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's administration, unemployment and informality increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called of the change, which generated great expectations regarding the progress of the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, the rise is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
February's low temperatures, besides causing trillion-dollar losses to the agricultural sector, limited the state's economy's opportunities for growth, caused a contraction in overall economic activity by 3.6% in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historic 31.16% drop in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost damage issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the rest 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated increase, because while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economic Active Population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand Sinaloens unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18 96 thousand people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly depending on the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we are seeing is a rise in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation passed in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars in an illicit way it is not easy that they work to earn them, they invest them and use them in something", he said.
Migration detained
López Cervantes pointed out that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state to go to work abroad, in the United States, has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entering and second because when they enter they already have a lot of difficulties in finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise", he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Sinaloan labour market is aggravated by the high level of lack of seriousness that prevails among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in this state work without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the state's disconnection are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Insurance Institute and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Provision.
The average monthly income of Sinal workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, 2011 saw the biggest drop in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June, the State FDI reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the State Government records a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the State Government in July requested the approval of a credit of 3 billion pesos, for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 billion pesos and until November there was no benefit from the debt in any sector of the state economy.
The reaction
For representatives of the employers' sector, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Processing Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the will of the different sectors, including the State Government.
"The performance of the economy of Sinaloa during this year has been really poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align the efforts of all and especially the good already synchronized march of this new team of Government, let's hope that next year is much better", he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López said events such as the frosts earlier this year have held back the state's economy and restricted its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, among which the freezes, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level e flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations that we had", he said.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, the aim is to channel the state towards productive activities with more dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we think it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we unlock the full potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa", he said.
There's a lot to do.
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better channel the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there is some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme", he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that a lot of work has been done and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still a lot to do", he said.
Convicted of eight kilos of marijuana
A Novolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in jail for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General of the Republic informed that the convicted small trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for health crime, in his variant of marijuana possession for sale.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was traveling in a white pickup truck, in which he was carrying a black bag in the luggage compartment of the vehicle and in the co-pilot's seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items have been made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted is still in the Legal Consequences of Crime Enforcement Center.
Debts to the books
The social works envisaged in programmes such as Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrantes are at risk of not being completed or of being seriously delayed due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The director of municipal social development said that although the construction programs have progressed so far, they are in a risky situation because the State Government has not met its obligations to offer contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is a possibility of delay in their finalization.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is almost over they have not given us anything, although since July they had to give us part of it", he said, "and we, in order not to register delays, we have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipe had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continue to function and this year we, in order to have access to these programmes, we had to obtain the resources to cover what the State had not paid", he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the State authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the procedures so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is almost over, they have given us nothing".
Court upholds "analogical cutting" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals with digital is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has rejected the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the House of Representatives have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to invalidate it were not obtained.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be followed to make the transition to terrestrial digital television a reality.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was defeated for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, due to the fact that the regulation of radio and television is a legal attribution reserved to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favor of the project only voted Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions provided for by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of ministers also decided to reject the complaint lodged by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the bill, in the sense that the Federal Executive could not structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I also do not believe that doing so would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", he said, and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, whose constitutional mandate is to run the state.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this has resulted in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the change, he argued, would be postponing the benefits of digitisation which implies a public interest decision that is not just a technical one, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
The Commission's proposal was to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on the basis of a proposal from the Commission.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done it through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
The executive, he said, could not be said to have invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress by issuing the decree in question, since it ensures the respect of laws issued by the legislature in the administrative sphere.
The possibility of a vote-by-vote count in Michoacán is being analyzed
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the total 6 thousand 74 minutes.
The possibility of a vote-by-vote count is a reality in the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data provided by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the total 6 thousand 74 minutes.
In this sense, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not approved either its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Law, at the same time that the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period for this electoral process to take effect and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the deadlines stipulated by the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same day, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state representative for the constitutional reforms, because he does not have the right to "sanction or challenge them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that with the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out the partial and total counting of votes by the local electoral body.
For example, the partial counting of votes for one or more electoral packages may be due to: the results of the minutes not coinciding; there is no ballot paper and the counting in the ballot box file is not with the president of the ballot box; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
Furthermore, the total count of votes received in all polling stations may be carried out where there is evidence that the difference between the candidate who is deemed to have won the election and the candidate who came second in the ballot is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that there is an express petition at the beginning of the session from the representative of the party and/or coalition who presented the second of the candidates indicated.
The total counting of the votes may also be carried out if at the end of the joint counting it is found that the difference between the candidate who is supposed to have won and the candidate who came second is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party from which the candidate came second, in which case the electoral packages which were the subject of the partial counting will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation in the Morelia election, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will and testament
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapaliname mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday at night, and on Monday people will pay their respects and there will be a requiem mass.
According to his family, the last wish of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving the tributes alongside the other people who died in the accident, Bacio Cortés' family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the chapel of vigil of the Nazario Ortiz Garza boulevard, where family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was honored at the Saltillo Technological Institute by his former colleagues from the baccalaureate of technology and the American football team that Felipe Bacio was a part of when he was preparing for the baccalaureate.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, he always said that to his family and friends", said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all her dreams, she considered him to be in the prime of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and took great care of his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo at a very young age to enroll in the Collège de l'Air in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he even had a truck hangover; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, for this he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an airplane.
His last farewell
With honors was said goodbye to the Mexican Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute that was led by the Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the State Government, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Technological Institute of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself both in studies and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, along with the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all of them civil servants of this department.
The remains of the Saltillo-born pilot Bacio Cortés arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 to be handed over by the funeral home to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the group, where he was awaited by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three abandoned bodies found on the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before they were found, the military authorities had presented to the media 11 people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different body parts and with a gunshot wound, in an abandoned property in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place 1.5 kilometers from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed by this place noticed that in the property, whose fence has the beige and brown color the gate was wide open.
Looking inside, at approximately three meters, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the men wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, no shoes; next to him was another man in a white T-shirt with suspenders.
A few feet away was the body of another individual wearing a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them were lying on their stomachs.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people were killed in another place, because no casings were found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by one organized crime group to the other, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured at Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to be related to kidnappings, murders, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the information published, in a first action on November 11 in the settlement of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and one was saved who had been deprived of freedom.
Three buildings and a cell phone were confiscated; they claimed to be part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another incident that occurred on November 12 at 06:00 AM, military personnel made a surveillance tour in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without license plates with two subjects on board.
When the military stopped them and conducted an inspection, they found a long gun, a magazine and 18 cartridges.
Later, and after these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are credited with clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with Italy's president tomorrow to introduce the new government that will face a crisis that has brought the country to the brink of economic disaster.
The prime minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with Italy's president on Wednesday to introduce the new government that will deal with a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire Eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, though it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present the president with the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
'I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase,' the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The framework is now well defined, he added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been damaged.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability has placed the yield on Italy's BTP 10-year bonds above 7%, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian Confindustria union, told the media after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot".
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Monti's chances of success were boosted considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which was forced to resign last Saturday by the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result", said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any failure or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks added to the pressure by observing that a Monti bankruptcy would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organisations on Monday.
He'll finish his meeting tour Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said his government should persist until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before moving the elections forward.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be formed only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties make it difficult to attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish experience is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 players called up from Spain, 10 have played in more than 50 international games.
Of the 22 delegates from Costa Rica, only one attended the 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to Costa Rica, when compared to the 22 called by both countries for today's friendly at 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San José.
While the national and European champions, number one in the monthly FIFA rankings, have a vast record of inter-team A-class games, only the Tricolore have defender Michael Umana as the only one to have all 50 international games.
This was achieved last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) over Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the Liga de las Estrellas and in powerful clubs in the English Premier League, maintain an intense activity in national league and cup championships and contests in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated qualifiers of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have international experience limited to one area, such as Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the greatest record of the Spanish National Team is that of goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equalled the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against the Tricolore today and they will set a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, the mastermind of the Barcelona team, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centuries of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke forward Raúl González with 102.
Close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with [Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umana are left-back Júnior Díaz, with 48 appearances and goal scorer Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have surpassed 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
The ones with fewer, with more than 30 presentations in Spain, include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest of it doesn't even make 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have yet to start.
Spain's all-time leading scorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto includes the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to deliver one of their best concerts yet next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the band assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to perform in this country.
It's that bassist and founding member Jeff Ament made sure of, speaking exclusively with Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is on the South American leg of their two-decade celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make their only stop in Central America.
That day will be at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the group of Los Angeles The X and the national of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will be performing in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once for a vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So we're really excited to take our music out there.
I ask you, because there's a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the days before.
What is your message to your most ardent followers?
Thank you for sticking by us all these years.
It took us 21 years to get to Costa Rica, and we thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time has passed until this concert.
Some people are already saying that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've done in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We played two huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this will help us get in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to it.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, and for both, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends always went surfing in Costa Rica, and Nicaragua, right next to Mexico, is a great place to surf, and that's how we learned about it, through the guys who like to surf.
When you see the tour, you've seen huge shows, with lots of songs.
What are you planning for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never been there, we have no restrictions as to what we can do.
We're going to try to do the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we're going to try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never rehearse the repertoire.
What is the reason?
I think part of the reason is that we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, which is why it's very difficult to choose which songs to play at each party.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven't played for a very long time, it helps us stay focused and it surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved those songs and that we may have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you're celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all that you've accomplished?
Yes, I'm sure you are.
First of all, I don't think any of us ever imagined that we would be a big rock band, and the fact that we've been doing it for over 20 years makes it sound like a dream.
We continue to share our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together is very moving.
We love each other and we love making music.
We're lucky to be able to go to places in the world that we've always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean to you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group of large groups.
We're very friendly with the people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and it's unusual.
Every once in a while, a group comes out of a city, but it's much more bizarre when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we did a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to still be friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to be a part of that Seattle sound that has emerged.
It's also very strange that a group like yours has been able to stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yeah, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that's a lot longer than a lot of bands normally last.
First of all, I think we're all lucky to be alive, and second of all, we all care about each other.
We're all close friends and because of that there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We have trust in each other with each other's music and it couldn't get any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew older, it became easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure we don't spend too much time on the road because it's easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
Remembering that people are here for the music helps us to remember that we have to respect the music and what it has brought, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and it was great at first.
We were a band for almost three years and we didn't release a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration about how short it was and the most important thing is that we're still very good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think about the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was an amazing human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production has sent us videos with different proposals and this was the band we liked the most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he does it with the first words he can think of.
As a bass player, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Some of the first people I remember were Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could spend the whole afternoon talking about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge going despite the fact that it's out of fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came out around the same time, and if that's relevant now, I think that's wonderful, because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
And that's interesting, because I think there are songs on the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, that are described as very dark songs, even though they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or a friend, those things start to affect your art and your music and those songs, I guess, represent that to me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even like that we can make obscure music.

Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his feet, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his 1990-2000 government, suffers from a variety of ailments, including tongue cancer for which he has undergone four surgeries and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of remission of sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt, he said that he only desires it because he feels innocent.
He has had four operations for tongue cancer, a weight loss of 40 pounds [18 kg], and other medical conditions, including severe erosive gastritis, a pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulation problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving time since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people due to an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official procession, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of various ministers and bosses, will start a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, next Wednesday, the high point of a long agenda of meetings with political and commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "appropriate for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of his ambassador from this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world's strongest emerging and developed countries, and has had a convention with the South American country since January of this year to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax swap agreements to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
In the commercial field, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The plumber with the mustache is going three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he had never done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the youngster in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming to stores this month, was designed from the start to take full advantage of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows for 3D gaming without the use of glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscope without glasses should work", said the head of Nintendo's specialized press in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game designed initially for this medium", as until now hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson maintained that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows for fast and fluid gameplay.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experienced players can take a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This foray into three dimensions of Super Mario also involves the character's return to a mobile console, a fact that has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo winked at the fans of the saga and repeated the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the plumber must travel through platforms mined by perils to release to the Princess Peach.
Even though I player finds novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in Luigi's "playable" cases.
Colom gives his approval to the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer to the United States for conspiring to launder 70 million US dollars.
Thus ends the trial for Guatemala to respond to the demand of the northern country which called for Portillo to be tried there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He said that during his term in office he had "not helped" with any judicial resolution and had given effect to all the extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did presupposes an executive approach after exhausting all the judicial and constitutional instances to try the former mandate of the 2004-2004 period.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Penal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzling Q120 million from the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 at-risk youth
The entity was created to avoid the marginalization of untrained young people.
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
In addition, the number of jobs currently obtained by this social group is over a hundred years old.
The anniversary was marked yesterday with a ceremony held in a former industrial complex in Fabra i Coats, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping people with little education, without work, with problems of drug addiction or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of leaders from entities and institutions that have collaborated with the association for 25 years.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the election season, showed the unified character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Alongside the president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former socialist Minister of Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor and current eco-socialist municipal councillor Ricard Goma attended the event.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, were also present in the Fabra i Coats' main hall.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is also, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove as an example of how to deal with bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does", he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-parties, evacuated
The invaders had taken over 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51
All 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance.
It seems that the nightmare that the residents of number 51 Balmes Street were living has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building they were illegally occupying yesterday at noon voluntarily and organized micro-parties that desperated the neighbors, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From this day forward there will be a control of access", said the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical system and part of the water system, painted the walls and left all kinds of residues, especially bottles of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and desperated the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that the business had dropped by 80% since the building was occupied.
The owner of the nightclub said that the intruders were acting as unfair competition because they were selling the drinks for three euros, whereas in the nightclub they were worth ten.
In addition, the owner of the recreation center had to respond to the neighbors' complaints about the noise, while, according to her, the trouble was not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbors of the area.
The manager of the nightclub explained that the problems were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since he "forgives" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about this situation.
The chairman of the municipal group of the PP in the city hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had called last week for "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of community life and civility that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last months squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there were also robberies.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must put an end to impunity and be implacable against the antisocial behaviour generated in property".
Yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30, the police moved to 35 Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people entering the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the appropriateness of the call beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 gates reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already defunct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed posters promoting Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
It also contained a numerical comparison with New York's Central Park.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park became once again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient itself on the north-south axis, otherwise high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is in favour of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boar as the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall called a mega-competition consisting of 16 contests for all the access gates to Collserola.
A doorway to the park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors on the field.
The question arises: Collserola - park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organisation and in terms of reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation for all architects in Barcelona.
It's almost a recurring theme that two members of this ancient caste of elected officials talk about when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions that coincide with three architects from Barcelona, university professors, who presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
Roldán said that after tackling the coastal front, "it is necessary to discuss the mountain front" because the speech by Ildefons Cerda, that of the green blocks, has not been completed.
"We must assume that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, it is very accessible.
The title 'Collserola gates' contains a 'lexical trap': they should not be thought of as accesses to a park, but as the delimitation of certain areas in which to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban planning world, described the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
The dangers arise from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience of the 1980s in the area of the Forum "swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the boundaries on which we can build.
"To limit something means to set the next step", that is, to go beyond it.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM) ] can cause real disasters".
Modol, who is more specific, thinks that, in a simplified way, the slope of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be understood as a park, not that of Barcelona".
Modol recalls that there is already work done by the Patronat of Collserola that "should not be lost", thanking the opportunity that the town hall offers to his corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
He also believes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe-conduct for architects to enter the debate, but he doubts whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success", he says) that have to be created: "We, the architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question which gives the title to this piece is complex, because the basis of the competition lacks a global vision of Collserola: "Sixteen transversal competitions have been called - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means that, at least in this case, he has chosen to participate in all 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can clash in the program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In his opinion, yes, the City Council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should be provided, throughout its extension, with a zone of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of pre-trial detention, the legal authority of the Red Casino granted a pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the lawsuit initiated against him for alleged blackmail.
After spending 72 years in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red grants him a pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which is following a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which presumably Manuel Jonás demanded the payment of an economic fee to the mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal case against the brother of the PANist mayor and on September 2 he was arrested and held in provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Prosecutor's Office 3 Agent of Property Crimes, he was transferred to the Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when a second detention order was issued after the Public Prosecutor's agent had dismissed the charges of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19th he was transferred to the Cadereyta Penal Center allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; but he only spent a few hours in the medium security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, a warrant was issued by the Clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was enough confirmed evidence to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as the one related to the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the gambling house representatives in exchange for allowing its operation.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to ask for a pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could regain his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Public Ministry agent attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and which of the gambling house's associates had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Under case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is granted a legal pardon and subsequently no claims can be made against him in relation to the lawsuit against him; no compensation for damages and no punishment will be demanded from him.
After the hearing of the court of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The clerk of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, went to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally pardoned and his case would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter crashed directly into the ground with complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate for flying.
"Elements that appear to indicate the unit had various contact with the ground, blades made contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage".
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, therefore it met the requirements necessary to transport the staff.
Furthermore, he said that the investigations made in the impact zone do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In one search it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact was structural.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for carrying them.
The ground was tilted from seven to 30 degrees.
For the moment, the Secretary assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can take a few months, it can even take a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Staff was operating at cruising speed and it happened on a gentle ascent.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruiser operation at the time of impact", he says.
During the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was performed according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions for takeoff, and as the aircraft advanced toward the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were low-altitude layers of fog.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the foggy conditions the crew searched for a lower altitude area with more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris over a small area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and sideways trajectory.
The model of dispersion of the remains of the aircraft allows to assume that the helicopter struck the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
No fire or explosion was detected.
At the crash site there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of any type of explosion or fire.
The latest results from the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple ground contacts.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above mean sea level, with the ground sloping from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it possibly disintegrated along its journey.
The information provides evidence that appears to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After a thorough search of an area wider than the surrounding area, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, supporting the presumption that the impact occurred in structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social insurance is leading an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and youth, called the 'Genetic Protocol of Child and Adolescent Obesity' which will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital de Especialidades of the National Medical Center of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav).
The survey invites the public, whether eligible or not, to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the tests for minors are carried out every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol started in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the target of 500-600 miners, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (southern Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (northern Distrito Federal).
He explained that the aim of this investigation and that of the other is to know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
He mentioned that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of the specific nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their family history of inherited diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays all participants will be subjected to anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetic tests (they are trying to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years there has been a 77 percent increase in obesity in boys and a 47 percent increase in obesity in girls; there has also been a dramatic increase in overweight", the IMSS specialist said.
He said the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country's population is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent Indo-American heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African heritage and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the genetic basis for obesity is usually the inability to burn the excess energy (calories) that is consumed, which is stored as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the integral evaluation of the children, which allows to detect whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even says that the presence of dark-colored pleats (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic abnormalities and even pre-diabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors give it to the parents in writing, and they are told every step and lifestyle change they need to take to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is lack of daily physical activity, sitting for most of the day in front of the TV and using transportation instead of walking short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - meat paste with corn flour wrapped in corn leaves), bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would prevent the rain
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphaltes modified with polymers to produce a mixture with a better yield, irrespective of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs of the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200,000 waterfalls each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous pavement is adequate, the waterfalls could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference "A Technological Opinion on Slate", organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that his laboratory is developing asphaltes modified with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera felt that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve yield, and therefore, the formation of cassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of petroleum, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a lower molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt is that at high temperatures, close to 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it is almost solid, while at very low temperatures asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that the strength of the asphalt on the streets is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental conditions and temperature, warns the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible paving, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
The outermost layer is the asphalt layer, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and later compacted.
Each of the small stones that make up the layer, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it, generating forces, it allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, these would spread better, the chemical engineer thought.
On the asphalt layer, he says, they put a last layer called the rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand, which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the road.
As the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the forces, the rolling bed also requires that it be of adequate thickness and the material of which it is made must be clean.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he says, as these greatly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil becomes wet, water spreads inside the layer and it's hard for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes the blackheads.
In the process of forming a cassis, he says, the first thing to go bad is the bearing film and only later is the asphalt layer affected, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programmes.
The member of the National Research System explained that vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of undercarriage and therefore the thickness of each layer of pavement must always be related to vehicle load and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid frequent formation of undercarriage.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to be investigated and worked on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow the repair of the cassis easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that prevented Melina Ramírez Serna from winning the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle receives her 14th princess title.
Once again Valle del Cauca was left with the desire to win the Miss Colombia crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the winner's podium, wearing the silver crown and the ribbon that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico rode with the crown and sceptre, the department already has 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Aljure (2008).
The big question a lot of people are asking today is:
Because the result represents the defeat of a big favorite who in every presentation has shown that she has everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected Queen of Police and Best Cheerful Face of Vogue in vain, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to designate her as First Princess was the fact that she was not convinced with her answer to the question "What was the book that marked you and why?" asked by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the candidate of Valle's answer to that question:
"I read a lot, I believe quite a lot in literature, I think it's a form of culturalisation, I definitely think the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a quite profound book.
Now I read Crime and Punishment, a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Ardor of Blood".
This answer was not pleasant, firstly because of the term "culturate" and secondly because it did not explain concretely how each book had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the outcome "the universe and wise, it is happening what must happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses put forward is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist in Bogota suggested that being the favorite, the ovated and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best handmade costume, and Queen Mother), "it aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she did not shine on the stage".
And we noted that in his first bathing suit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two runway shows on the eve of the coronation.
Although she appeared confident in both shows, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the Magdalena and Atlántico models.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on the RCN Channel's "Como en casa" (Like at Home) program, said that the fact that Melina was named princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets the most prizes during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
Plus, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That's why two days before the election, international juror Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who is committed to the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before starting the competition are already involved in projects", she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by his defects in his behind and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good diet and responsible physical work.
Queen's trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which actually for me hadn't been too well known, left her with spots on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the candidate's mistake was the surgeries she had undergone.
"Surgery is good, but Valle didn't know how to do it.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that".
For this prize, which the National Beauty Contest is awarding for the first time, after the swimsuit parade there was a cruel prediction that came true last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo was giving to Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown.
Whether it is true or not, the truth is that Melina is beginning a year of reign today, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international designation competitions of the National Competition.
She will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling yet dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
So was the work of the person from Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A typist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4th, a typist from Cali's CTI went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the FARC supreme leader, "Alfonso Cano", by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists who work in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of Eliazar González, a Puerto Tejada man who has been working in the field of criminal investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking adequate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is to say the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take with him clothes for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night, he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be that of the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the body site, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a local peasant, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galton magnifying glass, ink, a scanner, and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the corpse's fingerprints with those on the map.
His eyes did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the Puerto Tejada man was the official who confirmed to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
Searching for the Fingerprint
For a typist from Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dentistry is an exact science, with no margin for error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
Aside from identifying bodies, fingerprint technicians support investigations for crimes such as robbery and homicide and confirm the identity of captured individuals.
When caught, many offenders present false ID or have no documents.
We take their fingerprints and run them through the database.
The researcher related that in a burglary he had to remove part of a wall of a house, for in that place the thief had pressed his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to take a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different robberies", he recalls.
Fingerprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
A man was recently found dead with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a relative may be a suspect in the crime and indeed a print on the bottle coincided.
While that doesn't guarantee he's the killer, it does place him at the crime scene.
A CTI fingerprint technician explained that "fingerprints are extracted from objects with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a lift or a tape is used to remove them.
Afterwards, the prints are sent to Asif, the criminal database, or the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers", said the ITC expert.
He explained that not everything is as it is shown on the television program CSI.
Just as all that glitters is not gold, not everything you touch becomes an imprint.
It can be used, however, if the necessary confrontation is made.
The "indignant" are defying the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were rushing to camp outside Zuccotti Square.
A large number of people have complied with the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied New York City authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, by court order, Manhattan Square, from which they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were rushing to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to go thanks to a court order that allows the 'indignados' to camp again in that place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp in the square again, we will move to another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests", said one of the spokesmen of the Occupy Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the 'outraged' response to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignados' occupied a new park at the junction of the Canal Street and Sixth Avenue power plants, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church.
For at least an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved in and arrested some protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific number, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene in their favor before the Police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property - remains closed pending the celebration of a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday during which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analyzed.
Some of the demonstrators who had been there were carrying and distributing copies of the court order at the time and even handing it to the officers guarding the square, which caused 'some small clashes', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officers beat the protesters.
The court order forbids the authorities to evacuate Occupy Wall Street members or to apply 'laws issued after the beginning of the occupation or to prohibit protesters from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they used previously.'
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, but cautioned them that local laws do not allow them to move in with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councilor personally defended the dawn evacuation of Zuccotti Square, an operation that resulted in the arrest of 200 people and was decided because the protesters were 'violating the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it was becoming "a place where people don't come to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases, to harm other people", because "some shops had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The dawn evacuation this morning was repugnant and shows that deep down Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers", added the movement spokesman, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they do not plan to hold "major actions" on Thursday in conjunction with community organizations and labor unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be playing the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special on television.
She's set to appear alongside Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", a bodyguard on "Baywatch", a bunny in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private broadcaster CTV announced today that Anderson, along with crooner Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st as a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV released footage of the TV show today in which Anderson, also known for the massive Internet leak of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her then-husband, Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, is seen dressed as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus in a crib.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Indian-Canadian comedian who recently hosted a segment of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Noel program also features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is himself not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Rebuilding After the Earthquake
GDP up 1.5% on domestic consumption, ending downward spiral from early March
Since March, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the country's worst disaster since World War II.
The Tokyo Government's initial estimates put the damage at $300,000,000, a figure which, despite the difficult world situation, seems to have been alleviated.
After three consecutive quarters of decline, the data on Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to turn the page for good: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at an annualized rate.
The second quarter growth rate - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest growth rate since the January-March 2010 period.
The recovery is partly explained by the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, firms increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decrease after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real stimulus for the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use the deficits to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by higher expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo returned to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "safe havens" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the uncertain US forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a stone in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of the big technology groups.
Toyota and Sony, for example, blamed their poor results between July and September on the yen.
While markets remained in the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda was not letting down its guard.
"We must keep track of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen", said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the tipping points of the world economy, has highlighted that the major powers are being held back.
The index fell four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared with 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone was even below the average, which is in the 100s, dropping eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens again fuels the doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Tories won't sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to entangle itself in the maze that leads to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the 'consensus' of the new Greek transitional government is imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, said yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100 days period set in his appointment will be too short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said that he would not support the new austerity measures under any circumstances and reiterated his demand for new elections on the scheduled date of February 19.
The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit, Papadimos said yesterday when he opened a parliamentary debate which will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras's message does not cast doubt on his position: "We have committed ourselves to help the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything more".
The Conservative leader went one step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the agencies that need to release the €8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not release aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties sign "an unambiguous written commitment as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika's inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth installment" of 8.000 million, even if there is no definite date either.
The Greeks still have much to do.
Queen Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stresses the "leading" role of Spain in this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a prominent place at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofía recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second largest donor in the world in terms of this cooperation instrument, the "essence" of which is that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen opened yesterday the 5th World Micro-credit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in the one that aims to reduce to half the volume of people living on less than a dollar a day, which is set at the "poverty line".
The EU's new strategy for the fight against poverty, which was launched in the wake of the recent financial crisis, was to help the poorest of the poorest countries to cope with the challenges of the global economic crisis.
We have "achieved many goals" and "are facing many challenges".
The Micro-credit Summit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform from which to promote 'two basic objectives'.
So, His Majesty explained that the objective is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that 100 million of these families are lifted out of the poverty line in which they are living now.
The impetus for the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path pioneered a few years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, Queen Sofía said, as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of poverty eradication", whose work she has known since 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to see its loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project earned him yesterday the title of "head of the family" from the "banker of the poor" at the meeting in Valladolid.
Finally, Queen Sofía ended her speech by encouraging the audience to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to make progress in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
It also stressed that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said that microcredit implies "a serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of the developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it be the victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
Secretary of State for International Cooperation Soraya Rodriguez applauded the "success" of giving "confidence" to people "to whom everyone closes the door"; and Valladolid mayor Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed the people in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Leipzig on Monday 14 November was a smooth affair for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and also chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally included in the programme but was imposed in the autumn, notably to satisfy activists who consider the government's policy too lax with regard to Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The standing ovation that Angela Merkel received for several minutes after her speeches and, a few hours later, that of Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Euro-friendly finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The Chancellor's - and the motion's - main idea is based on a slogan: the response to the crisis is 'not less Europe but more Europe'.
Not only because Europe is peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
The Chancellor said that "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the EU's control over the budgetary policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also lead to the election of the European Commission President by universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe".
This is at least one of the proposals in the motion adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that the Twenty-seven will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU think they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is hostile to it too.
But the milestone has been set.
The delegates also rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight each country's weight in the Executive Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which of course would increase the weight of Germany.
In her efforts to appease the climate within her party, the Chancellor has repeatedly referred to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she has not sought to win her congress on the backs of the "small" European countries or the countries in difficulty who are quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
While the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the crevices.
Two centuries ago, Leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What is sick leave fraud ?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family allowance fund and to deliver a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistants.
And to accompany this offensive, which is based on a desire to save money in a context of austerity, but is no less a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
Firstly, in order to save money, the government is considering imposing a fourth day's absence on private sector employees before they are able to take care of a work stoppage.
Clearly, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, which is at least 15% of his monthly income.
The measure, which is likely to provoke anger, would bring in 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
The new law would also be accompanied by another measure, which would be more symbolic: imposing on civil servants one day of absence without compensation in the event of a stoppage of work (they have so far no period of absence, as opposed to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also re-introduces the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses linked to work stoppages.
"The checks will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you will pay back", Xavier Bertrand warned on the RTL microphone on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of advertising seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of the fraud in the case of work stoppages.
Since 2002, it has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives, which have mostly paid off.
The French are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros in daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, at €11.3 billion.
Of this, 46% was for maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% for sick leave, or EUR 6.2 billion.
And that's 2.5% of health care costs.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days of stoppage from work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the group Alma Consulting.
An average that hides some discrepancies: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had never taken a sick day.
Another study, this time from the Health Insurance Department, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was for less than 8 days, 22% for 8 to 14 days, 15% for 15 days to a month, 15% for one to three months and 11% beyond.
Compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more likely to stop work than those in other countries.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence (for health reasons or not) ranged from 10% to 11% in France, compared to 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16% to 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud of sick leave is very small compared to the black-collar crime.
Fraud is on a small scale.
Since 2002, the legislation has been strengthened, and checks are systematically carried out on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term detentions were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically checked, there were 11% of cases of "inappropriate or unjustified" out of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, therefore, 169 000 cases of "unjustified" work were recorded, out of several million employees who had been taken off work due to illness.
This figure is very small compared with, for example, the number of people working in the dark.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, who authored a report on the issue in June, this would represent a €9-15 billion annual shortfall in tax revenue, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud in these allowances.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to bring its economy back on track.
This was stated by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that the 100 days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To continue the efforts to revive the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme", said the head of government, who made his first public speech at the opening of the vote of confidence debate in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro-area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro-area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Papadémos forecast that the country's public deficit will be reduced to "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right wing, on Monday backed the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to further austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of any new measures", he said at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt and of combating waste but was hostile to any policy that would impede economic recovery.
The European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Olli Rehn, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary €8 billion loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the measures, was told by Samaras that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada
The Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements for it.
This was one of the conclusions of a landmark report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
The committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this option is necessary, for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalisation of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
With or without medical treatment, 77 percent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, say experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the fact that most Canadians would like to die at home, 68.6% of Canadians end up dying in a hospital.
In the country as a whole, Quebec has the highest rate of hospital-related deaths, with 86 percent of all deaths occurring in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors reach conclusions that run counter to the federal government's position, which has already said it does not want to change the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on incompetent or non-consenting persons.
The report also calls for the Commission to take a more active role in the fight against drugs and to promote the use of drugs in the fight against drug addiction.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
It is worth noting that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering, according to a poll conducted by Angus Reid in 2010.
And 66 percent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
Of those who have assisted suicide, 41% feel that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear when it comes to whether or not a patient should continue to receive care, say the authors of the report.
In their list of recommendations, they also suggest that the Criminal Code should state that withdrawal from care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also calls for training of health professionals to respect the duty to refuse end-of-life care without fear of criminal prosecution.
In terms of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Finally, as regards palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations by other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
The report also calls for the adoption of a new approach to the problem of euthanasia, which is to be based on the principle of 'euthanasia for the sick'.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and is over 18 years old could ask for help to commit suicide", said Mr Deschamps, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the individual above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But "in society", he says, "there are signs and constraints".
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's conclusions, calling them "pro-euthanasia rhetoric".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly disputes the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, namely the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls for President Assad to step down
Damascus has denounced a "conspiracy"
Syria is becoming more isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday outside the Foreign Ministry building.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria's Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, is resisting them and denouncing a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League's suspension of Syria, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbors, took a stand in favor of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II yesterday became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "quit power" in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces have been killed.
"If Bashar has the interest of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
The European Parliament has called on the Commission to take the necessary measures to ensure that the EU's financial instruments are properly used to finance the EU's external action.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their own people and cannot satisfy them will leave", he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country towards which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the regime" in Syria, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the US, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are taking a harsher and harsher tone" on the crackdown in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces have died in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians died "in an exchange of fire and shelling by heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was "moving towards the end of the crisis".
He also strongly reacted to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he described as a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not yield", he added, assuring that "plots against Syria will fail".
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civilian protection mechanism" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said was locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis plan decided on 2 November and including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities affected by the protest and the release of the arrested protesters.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, yesterday called the decision of the Arab League "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the plan to end the crisis, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy and
Monti demands time for the markets and sacrifices for the Italians
The future Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and implement a programme, which will include "sacrifices", in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting with the unions and employers' organisations today.
He should set up a relatively small cabinet of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a lot of sacrifices", said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the President-designate of the Council.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to ask for a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti presenting a shortlist of perhaps a dozen ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking for time.
The Commission has also been asked to present a report on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of the environment.
The President's appointment was initially welcomed by the markets, but concern has returned, especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should form a team comprising mostly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should last until 2013, when the next legislative elections are due, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of the Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti, once in office, pledged to work urgently with the aim of Italy becoming a "leader" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has in particular called for further austerity measures.
The Italian 'boss of bosses', Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, 'because a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters'.
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of epoch" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of the serious" and a "different Italy", according to the editors.
The big unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy must put up 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, a US nuclear risk NGO said on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency to identify the researcher.
The IAEA last week expressed "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" to Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS extensively drawing on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, allegedly worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear facility in Chelyabinsk (Ural), and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic explosive diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he allegedly left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company allegedly led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He was then reportedly involved in the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA cites "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "has been aided by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knows the technique well, but who, as one member state has informed the Agency, has spent most of his career working on the technology in his home country's military nuclear programme".
Anti-Muslim crimes and offenses have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or barely progressed, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violent crimes against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase, compared to a 13% increase in crimes against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% overall increase in anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offenses increase again", Human Rights First said, adding that "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant".
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds one of the organization's officials, Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and should do more to address these abuses", he added, suggesting that this could be done through improved police reporting of "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform to look more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes to the layout of its platform, allowing users to track the activity of those they follow, making its service a bit more like Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to follow more clearly, live the activity of other "Twittos", the users whose messages ("tweets") are followed and those who follow you.
This allows you to see if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorites, etc.
Twitter's new feature was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being rolled out to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its unintuitive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to re-air someone else's message, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making the insiders happy, is thus opening up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of the mainstream Facebook and Google+ networks.
On the network, users debated in a series of tweets about the value of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and too much like Facebook", wrote @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some of my Twitter feed", @dannykronstrom tweeted.
Austria
The European Parliament has adopted a resolution on the situation in the Middle East.
The Social Democrats/Christian Democrats government in Austria decided on Tuesday to inscribe a budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation by the rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
The Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann announced this decision after a ministerial meeting, when Austria's public debt was 74.6%, well above the 60% limit set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's creditworthiness were to be reduced by just one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year", argued Christian Democrat deputy chancellor and foreign minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus responding to a request made at the Brussels summit of the eurozone member countries on 26 October last: the Heads of State and Government had called for the reduction of public deficits and the return to a balanced public accounts to be included in the constitution or in a law of the same value by the end of 2012.
The system adopted by the Austrian Government is closer to the "German model", Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, as of 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and the municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to bring public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
The Japanese yen
No threat of further intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was close to the historic levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars in a massive move to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just set a new record of strength against the greenback since 1945.
But the yen has been steadily rising since then, buoyed by purchases by investors who see it as a "value safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell back to 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen bar, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro over 160 yen.
The surge in the Japanese currency is hurting the archipelago's exports because it raises the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign income earned by Japanese firms when they convert it into domestic currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), stressed Mr Noda who fears that this appreciation of the yen will kill the fragile recovery.
The world's third largest economy returned to growth in the third quarter - 1.5% over the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption that had been hit hard by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister said the yen's rise in value did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the Bank's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that no further monetary easing was expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bonds by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion), raising to 55,000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts it spends on purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
The euro area:
Interest rates are rising, stock markets are falling.
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to undermine European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and improved growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro zone, European stock exchanges are sinking a little more into negative territory, this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10am, the CAC 40 is down 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Frankfurt Dax is down 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With renewed tensions over the yields of distressed eurozone states, equity markets around the world continue to return some of their recent gains".
"Investors are nervous, they are all too aware of the risk of contagion", said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, as quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, in turn suffering from renewed fears among market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, is looking to Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of fluctuations until investors have evidence that the situation has stabilized", said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed anxiety about the future of the eurozone is hurting the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
The European currency is at $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it fell after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, adopted a motion at its congress on Monday, which includes the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish bonds of the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These tensions on interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the stakeholders.
The future Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, has asked for time to be given to the markets to restore the situation in Italy, which is threatened with suffocation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the 'main task' of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight as the country holds parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between German and Spanish 10-year bonds reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
Statistically, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1% in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it's really the fourth one that economists worry about the most.
Germany, on the other hand, grew by 0.5% over the same period.
The first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., as the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is one subject which cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of firms.
It is right that an election date should provide an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the role of nuclear energy in them.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores the full economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
With seven billion people on the planet, demographic change will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless we deprive a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources will have to be overcome in order to continue producing electricity permanently, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case in Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, or in Switzerland, which simply intends to build only the latest generation of power stations.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name just a few, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States, on the other hand, decided after Fukushima to add a new unit to its fleet by resuming the construction of a plant that had been interrupted after the accident at Three Mile Island.
The German model, which focuses on renewable energy sources, is sometimes presented as an example, but the reality is contrary to the discourse.
The choice of Berlin will result in higher electricity prices, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, especially from Russia, and a jump in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal-fired power stations.
Within a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is worth considering.
Europe's champion in wind power, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind; as a result, its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
In a globalised economy, the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, while French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a sharp increase in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power illusory.
The price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not oppose this energy on principle, the polls show.
It should be recalled that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build an industrial sector of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 indirect jobs.
It is a strong exporter, and this has led to a galaxy of SMEs specialising in international markets and making them very effective job creators that cannot be outsourced.
If France were to decide to withdraw from nuclear, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing as a burden the 6 billion euros a year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to last 60 years when the manufacturer 's decline is scheduled ?
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no such thing as a miraculous power source, nor is there any evil one.
Areva's development of low-emission, nuclear and renewable solutions is a testament to the complementarity of energy sources.
For the nuclear industry, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France we have a Safety Authority which exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing power stations, such as the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are imbued with the same obsession with safety.
In the past half century, the nuclear industry has suffered three major accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, was operated under normal operating conditions and had no human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human errors caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the safety authorities, the operators and the French and German manufacturers, the EPR has a design that makes it able to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians who wish to build a power station, the halt of its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF, leaving them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy package for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate a debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - overcrowding of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, the administrative harassment of foreign students has made headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (read Libération of May 23) proclaiming that France "does not need foreign talent, bricklayers and restaurant servers".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a fairly broad consensus on this issue between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard, who explained that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on both the left and the right.
On both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that is shown to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally rewarding; it's economically very costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent book synthesising the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may replace domestic workers, especially the low-skilled, putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, working for the most part in sectors where there is a shortage of jobs.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not keep pace with the supply of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will struggle to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants mean that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows leads to a 0.6 to 0.9% increase in real wages in the long term.
This is without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organisation estimates that in Germany, for example, an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 to the public budgets on average over his or her lifetime.
At the beginning of his term of office, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go after the missing growth points "with his teeth".
The teeth in question, by serving as a deterrent to immigrants, have had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it is necessary to think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious commodity; it is also a fragile commodity.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, has known throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have thought that, if democracy was to triumph over its enemies once and for all, it would be enough to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
We know from Napoleon "the Little" that this was a matter of ease of thinking.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can even become an instrument of oppression, as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, the Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also and above all a political and democratic crisis.
The mixed reality of the Greek referendum has been a double-edge in this respect: the need for a strong political comeback, but also the troubling feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought through to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and that, for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to necessity and in scattered order.
A white-seat European absolute monarch or a leap in the void of nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen !
No, we do not want a set of rules, but a common, full-fledged, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - and we would not know where to stop enumerating them - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bending to the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international scene.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgent need is to give back to the people's sovereignty the control of the European project.
Because it is together that Europeans can reduce their debt burden, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The solution to the crisis will require decisions at European level, which cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless of course this leads to disaster.
After having long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for a European economic government.
I'll see you then.
But to think of this without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by the citizens, would be a new folly and a new impasse.
We must take on a new phase of European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not do enough.
That lesson is still valid.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a Europe which is more democratic politically, a genuine European sovereignty of the people.
In order to make Europe, let us make Europeans.
Smart cards are becoming more and more common
The world's smart card fair opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM-based phones, etc.) to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most promising segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or make purchases by simply holding the card in front of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and represent almost 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payments.
Some 26 million Visa cards already have this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been deployed.
But the big surfaces are the double-edged sword.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Passes this year.
To move up to the next level, banks must now equip their customers.
"Two major French banks have committed themselves to systematically distributing contactless cards to their customers in the future", announces Gérard Nébouy, managing director of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is just a first step towards the payment medium of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for transacting.
"They were late".
"But they should finally see a real boom next year".
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012", says Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a contactless payment case.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Corporation, too, said yesterday that it was preparing to launch an offer allowing its customers to pay without contacting their mobile phone.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front spreads
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected links between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
The Commissioner said that the EU had to take action to ensure that the EU's external borders remained open.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French nationals in Niger last January has reportedly uncovered the gateways.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Akimi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their kidnappers in an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the operation, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the calls made is directed towards several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who says he is close to Akmi and the sect.
"This is a breakthrough but we will probably have to wait for more formal evidence before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"It has been known for years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from outside and is becoming more and more active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months this 'support' has been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourse of Boko Haram or in its modes of operation, which now involve the use of increasingly complex suicide bombers or explosive devices of the same design as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has been pressuring Abuja to address the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of intellectuals of little interest.
Success in a Hurry
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Hausa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
The association quickly became successful in this poor region.
It is politicizing and demanding strict observance of Sharia law while its militants are waging a struggle against the ungodly central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars and government offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuance.
The army has surrounded the city, 800 people have been killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, captured alive, is killed in prison.
From then on, the sect will become more radical and leave its northern fiefs.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram attacked the secure police headquarters in Abuja in a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local United Nations headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would run from Mauritania to Somalia and then on to Nigeria, is now a matter of concern for all security specialists.
While AQIM has invaded Mali and Niger, and Somali al-Shabaab operates in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all information".
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are all competing for simplicity and ignorance.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe that.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been making increasingly blunt statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.
The slogans - often unsubstantiated - about China, Iran and aid to Israel were used.
Mitt Romney, the front-runner in the "Grand Old Party" nomination race, has threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and sue them "for currency manipulation", a hot topic in an America exasperated by the migration of entire segments of its industry to Asia.
The Commission has already taken a number of initiatives in this area, including the creation of a European office for the protection of the environment.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly strangled himself in the face of an emotionally "flattering" attitude.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is stagnating in the depths of the polls, remains unheard.
In the image of Reagan
Romney also vowed military action against Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran", he boasted.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-best candidate, has an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop a nuclear capability" - apparently ignorant of the fact that China has had the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike Iran, says he's ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, which was banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We're a long way from 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Opponents of the current president counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They point out that Obama himself was an amateur and had to put water in his wine when it came to counterterrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, on his hesitations in Libya, thus affixing to him the label of weak.
But the attack is not so easy.
The public is rather positive about Obama's national security record, which is that he took out bin Laden.
Since Iraq, she's been wary of military interventions that lead to a stalemate.
And by arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama is striking more justly.
Nord Stream, new gateway for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which links Western Europe directly to Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has been put into operation.
It's supposed to provide the gas equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with glitter.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, which links Russia to Germany directly under the sea, on the shores of the Baltic Sea on Tuesday, with a fine buffet and orchestra.
The European Union has also been involved in the negotiations for the conclusion of the agreement on the European gas market, which is to be signed by the European Union and the United States.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will be delivered to Western Europe every year via a first 1,224 km pipeline linking the St Petersburg region to the state of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline is to be completed by the end of 2012, delivering a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all of France's consumption.
And there's already talk of building a third one on the same course.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this massive project looks like a victory.
The project was strongly opposed by Poland and the Baltic states.
Nord Stream will enable gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, both countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the 1939 Hitler-Stalin alliance to occupy Poland.
That is, whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But this has come at the cost of weakening energy Europe, since the project has created a rift between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are big consumers of gas and whose deposits are in decline.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that links us in an organic way", confirmed François Fillon when inaugurating this gas pipeline, demonstrating how the major gas contracts are as much political as economic.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom executives, present in large numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is steel reinforced with concrete to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the sea floor, at 200 m in average.
The construction of the dam was necessary to avoid minefields from the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution", says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
Measures to protect wildlife have also been increased.
The tube is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, that is not interrupted by anything along its entire length: neither valve, nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off Sweden, but the project was abandoned as the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state-owned company permanently established off their coast.
"If there is a problem, we stop the gas flow in less than a minute", says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leakage, the gas in the gas pipeline is therefore released into the air.
But this is considered unlikely by the builders who have designed the welds to have a leak every 100,000 years.
The pipeline is monitored by a submarine robot, which is towed by a ship for external observation, and by a device which moves inside the pipeline.
It is shaped like a cigar and is inserted into a tube three feet wide and pushed by the gas.
When it arrives, after three full days of travel at a speed of 10 feet per second, it provides precise information on the possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the slightest repair.
The circulation of the gas is simply ensured by pressure.
It's 200 bars at the start, 100 at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which retains 51% of the shares.
The German companies E.ON and BASF each account for 15.5%, followed by the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies have set up a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
The company is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased all the gas transport capacity to this company for a period of 20 years.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported", says Jens Müller.
The construction of the gas pipeline was financed by 30% by the shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to be around EUR 7.4 billion for the two pipelines.
For example, GDF Suez has invested 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure to recoup their costs, since only Gazprom bears the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea at Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
The valves, 15 feet (4.5 m) high, form the gas outlet.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and by 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand name.
Created about 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine is a way to bring back the taste of writing.
It has the smell of adventure, of hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as if aged by time.
Yet, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook design but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover benches, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million units sold.
This is a far cry from the confidential production of the first few years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine is exported beyond Italy to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw a robot portrait of the buyer, because the notebook is attractive to businessmen, students and professionals alike.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which started with 12 employees, has grown to almost 100 and since 2008 has had two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from Fnac to small shops in the city center and has managed to impose her identity.
"We followed the trend and this new need to write, despite the rise of e-mails", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own carnet.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, notebooks, pens, computer cases... The brand is available on a whole range of media.
A success that made some people envious: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate for disabled workers remain so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of the disabled opens today.
Despite a proactive public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate of disabled people is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the general population.
Discouraging ?
"No", says Éric Blanchet, director general of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled".
"The progress made in the last 15 years is considerable".
"Back then, the unemployment rate was not doubled, but tripled".
"But there is still a lot of work to be done".
It must be said that for the unemployed disabled, there are still many obstacles to employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 (on average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a baccalaureate and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10 000 are disabled.
Finally, longterm unemployment is very high: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, these are all criteria which make it particularly difficult to return to employment and which "are at the heart of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, the managing director of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That's for the objective brakes.
The unspoken word remains, the mentality is changing, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association indicated that the managers interviewed had "a low level of knowledge of disability", with an "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disabled".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set by a law of 1987.
The last known figures, from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, director general of Agefiph, the organisation responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of establishments "taxed", as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on companies", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups".
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before facing the Blues on Tuesday night (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens have not hidden the pleasure they have from this friendly match.
We don't go so far as to say that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the podium of the Stade de France, Leekens and Hazard have made peace.
Five months after his striker's temperamental gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to go on", the Lillois said.
As for the contrast between his performances in club and in selection, "it's a whole, he justified himself".
"In Lille, I'm there all year, which is not the case with Belgium".
"I need to get my act together".
Prepared for the match against Romania on Friday night, Hazard is coming to St. Denis to finally "shine".
But it also has the word "pleasure".
He has been a regular for the Blues since the age of seven and was a key part of their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a supporter", he says.
This is bound to add to the 'special' character of this meeting.
Especially since in front, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We just ran into each other".
"To be able to play against them, that's just happiness!"
Leekens, for his part, spoke with a certain glee of "pride".
"Pride" to play "a gala game".
"Proud" also to note - as a "neighbour" - that France has "become a very high-level team again" just over a year after the Knysna trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a great job", he said enthusiastically.
With Belgium missing out on the next Euro, the technician could be sharing a plane with the Blues heading... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting big", he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll find out in the next few games". Including the one against France.
Portugal is very confident
Portugal under Paulo Bento will start with a lot of optimism in their return match against Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams had a lack of realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already seeing it in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, which he has been in charge since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to unlock.
In view of the match 0-0 in the Zenica hell on Friday, it is obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the game for over an hour, but they were unable to score that precious goal, which would have relieved them.
"It's a good result, but it's a bit of a risk because we didn't score on the outside".
But at home, in their brightly lit Stadium of the Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will be able to pass, in front of an audience that should be as boiling, even if the game is obviously "very close", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close game, but we are absolutely convinced that we can win", said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012", said the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The draw on Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk because we didn't score outside", Bento said.
"We are going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and that has players with a lot of individual qualities", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians in order to "not give them time to think".
That's a good idea, but you have to be realistic this time.
