At this stage of world history, there is no such thing as an independent press in America. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinion, and if you did, you would know in advance that it would never appear in the press. I was regularly paid to keep my honest opinion out of the newspaper I work for. Many of you are paid to do the same, and any of you who are crazy enough to write what you think would be out on the street looking for another job. If I had let my honest opinion appear in just one edition of the newspaper I work for, I would have quit my job in less than 24 hours.

Man has many desires which he does not really want to have, and it would be wrong to assume otherwise. He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be a bitter disappointment to him. Such a desire is the desire for eternal life.
