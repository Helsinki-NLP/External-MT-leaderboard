According to the British media, the U.S. Vice-Minister of Naval Operations, General William Moran, said that even as the U.S. Navy is re-energized to deal with the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, the U.S. continues to focus its efforts on the Asia-Pacific region — the Pentagon, which extends the area to include the Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific.
According to the United Kingdom ' s Jane ' s Defense Weekly website, on 24 September, the United States listed Russia and China as strategic competitors in its new defence strategy, which was announced at the beginning of the year.
Since then, the United States Navy has resumed its second fleet in order to confront Russian activities more directly.
Reports suggest that these moves raise some questions and concerns among allies and analysts who fear that the United States Navy may be far away from the “Asia-Pacific rebalancing” strategy that marks the Obama administration.
However, General Moran said that the focus of the United States Navy remained the Western Pacific.
On 24 January 2018, at a round-table discussion entitled “Addressing the challenges of the high seas”, hosted by the National Asian Research Office in Washington, D.C., he said: “There has been no major change for us.”
Milan said, “The focus remains rebalancing, shifting of gravity, or whatever you want to describe it.”
He acknowledged, however, that the United States was close to Europe.
He said, “We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do.”
Although Moran pointed out that the overall policy regarding Russia was within the purview of the United States Secretary of Defense, he warned that “Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has shown that if we clash with them, they will be very tough.”
Admiral Moran said that, as part of the renewed American campaign against Russia, China and other competitors, the United States Navy was dynamically deploying its forces into a “new mode of operation”, which would help surprise opponents as to where American carriers or other assets would be deployed at any given time or place.
He said, "We, the Navy and the Marines, support it -- - the concept of unpredictability of operations, not to appear in the same place again and again, almost like the hairline -- -- this is our approach."
It was reported that this new approach was first attempted by the Harry Truman carrier combat group, whose early deployment included working visits to the port and patrolling the area normally only through.
Moran said that the United States Navy was currently working to ensure that allies knew that these warships would continue to patrol the traditional areas, and was also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment procedures.
The Royal Australian Navy Commander, Lieutenant General Michael Nunan, also addressed the event, stating that the Australian army could work seamlessly with the United States carriers.
He said that the situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy planned to procure an additional nine frigates equipped with the Zeus Shield operational system.
A number of airlines have increased or restored fuel surcharges since October 5.
Yesterday, airlines such as Xiang Poon Air and Okai Air announced that, as of 5 October 2018 (the date of the tickets), the fuel surcharge on the domestic route would be 20 yuan per passenger plus and the fuel surcharge would be 30 yuan per passenger on the domestic route below 800 km.
The company Xiang Poon Aviation, Okai Aviation and others announced that the rate of surcharges for fuel on domestic routes below 800 km has risen from 10 yuan/person to 20 yuan/persons, and the rate of surcharges for fuel on domestic routes over 800 km from 10 yuan/person to 30 yuan/persons per passenger since 5 October 2018 (the date of the ticket).
Children and members of the military/police have been disabled for 10 yuan/persons; infants continue to be exempted.
According to the person in charge of the airfares, the airline had indicated in the notification that the surcharge for fuel was levied on the date of the original ticket, and that the surcharge for fuel was not refunded in exchange for the ticket.
This meant that domestic airline tickets issued prior to 5 October would not be subject to the new fuel surcharge if they were to be changed after 5 October.
Since 5 June 2018, a number of airlines, such as Air State, East China, Naval Navigation, Shanghai Aviation, Spring and Fall Aviation, Shenzhen Aviation, Western Aviation and Okai Aviation, have resumed charging fuel surcharges on domestic routes, which have been cancelled for three years, to the standard of $10 per person.
On this occasion, Xiang Poon Aviation and Okai Aviation were the first to announce an increase in the fuel surcharge, and as of the press release, no follow-up of the adjustment was reported by the four major airlines in the country.
It is also understood that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department provides that the airline will be free to decide whether to charge a surcharge for fuel in November.
At the earliest, on 27 September, it was announced that the fuel surcharge would be recharged as of 2 November.
According to the Thai-Thai air website, all air tickets issued or reissued on or after 2 November by the Thai-Thai and Hong Kong-Tay Dragons will include fuel surcharges, long-distance flights to Hong Kong and the South-West Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, and to Africa, with fuel surcharges of $652 and short-distance flights of $146.
Costs apply to all types of tickets, are calculated for each segment and include quotations for air tickets from all direct distribution channels in Thailand.

On Friday, Ito Ito, Japan, recognized $1.3 billion in impairment losses on investment in China's Sino-China shares, and its largest business investment transaction was written off as a result of trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man walked past the HQ.
According to Maru Hong, the United States cereals sector, under the banner of the trade war, has suspended its financial transactions in agriculture.
Earlier, some Japanese manufacturers of heavy equipment, telecommunications companies, etc., had warned of the effects of trade friction between the United States and the United States when they announced their latest performance, and now these Japanese traders have joined the ranks.
The United States and China imposed customs duties on each other ' s hundreds of billions of dollars of commodities, and the President of the United States, Trump, threatened to extend the tax to more than $500 billion in total Chinese-American merchandise if the dispute could not be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Director of Commercial Finance of Ito, said that the impact of the trade dispute on the Chinese economy might be even greater next year.
Ito ' s business and the Thai Bing Group invested $10 billion in Nakashin in 2015 to gain 20 per cent of their equity.
Hachimura alleges that Ito ' s commercial interest in this portion of the shareholding was increased by a loss of 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion), as it was assumed that the Chinese share price would not recover in the near future.
Ito ' s commercial business maintained a projection of profits for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2019 at 500 billion yen.
In July, China imposed a 25 per cent import tariff on soybeans from the United States to counter China's trade friction initiatives.
"Our grain business has been hit by trade friction between the US and China," says Maru Hong Finance Minister Yahoo.
He stated that Gao Hong had stopped financial transactions in his own account since September.
In his statement on Friday, Gao Hong spokeswoman Pat Burke stated that the company’s move was “restricted by internal policies and due to a lack of market opportunities”.
He also indicated that the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to a reduction in employment.
The estimated annual profitability of the two hundred and thirty billion yen has been maintained, supported by pulp and paper and power generation operations.
On Thursday, residential commerce announced a 16% increase in profitability between April and September, emphasizing that “the US-China trade problem has led to uncertain prospects.”
On Friday, Mitsubishi Commercial moved the annual profit forecast up to record levels as a result of increased coal coke production and higher prices for commodities such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Commercial also announced a new business plan to increase the profits from the fiscal year up to 31 March 2022 from the estimated 640 billion yen this year to 900 billion yen ($7.98 billion).
On November 5th, China-News Network reported that the mid-term election poll in the United States is in a countdown.
On 4 November, President Trump and his Democratic rivals actively “circumstanced” to their core constituents.
Both parties pointed out that voter turnout would be the key to shaping the election.
It was reported that in the 48 hours prior to the popular vote in the United States, Trump was busy attending a Republican campaign, while former President Obama went to Indiana to stand for the impending Democratic Federal Senate candidate, Joe Donnelly, and shouted to the crowd the final demands before the election.
On 4 November, Trump went to Megang, Georgia, to stand for Republican governor candidate Brian Kemp, and said, “Tuesday, you have to be at the polling station, you have to vote.”
“The contrast between this election cannot be made clearer.”
Voter political enthusiasm has risen to a rare peak, and early voting in some states has gone far beyond normal.
Successive Presidents of the United States faced the first midterm elections, and the number of parliamentary seats in his party tended to decline.
According to a new poll published by the Washington Post and the American Broadcasting Corporation News Network (ABC News) on 4 September, while the Democratic Party's federal House of Representatives remained an advantage, Republicans could benefit from economic assessment and from Trump's strict interest in border security.
According to the polls, registered voters prefer the Democratic House of Representatives to Republicans, with a ratio of 50 per cent to 43 per cent, but there is still a decline from the 14 percentage points ahead in August.
Another poll by the National Broadcasting Corporation of the United States (NBC) and the Wall Street Journal also shows that Democrats still outnumber Republicans by 7 percentage points.
Obama, as he was told, said to the crowd on the occasion of Senator Donnelly's campaign: “When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, the consequences are inevitable.
Democracy cannot work when people can only lie to themselves."
“The only way to put an end to the actions of these Republicans is by you and your vote.”
The Democratic Party faces the most difficult elections in the Senate for decades, and the Republican Party now holds more than half of the 51 seats.
However, the vote in the House of Representatives was favourable, and the Democratic Party needed to win 23 more seats to take control of the House of Representatives, which had 435 seats.
According to the analysts of the projected election site FiveThirtyEight.com, the chances of Democrats winning the House of Representatives are as high as 85%.
The National Political Consultative Conference held an important theoretical seminar on strengthening and improving the work of the Civil Affairs Association, attended by and addressed by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
From 29 to 30 June, the National Political Consultative Conference held a seminar in Kyoto on key ideological theories for the strengthening and improvement of the work of the General Secretary of Xi Jinping.
The Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Republic of China and the Chairman of the National Political Consultative Conference, Wang Yang, attended and addressed the meeting.
He stressed that the important ideas of the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping for strengthening and improving the work of the Civil Affairs Association provided a clear picture of the role of the Civil Affairs Association, its objectives, its mission and its practical requirements, and that the scientific answers to a number of key questions of a directional, holistic and strategic nature were a powerful intellectual weapon guiding the work of the Civil Affairs Association of the New Era.
It is important to follow through on this important idea, to grasp its significance, to enrich its content and spiritual essence, to learn to do what is practical and practical, to promote the quality of the work of the Political Consultative Assembly through theoretical learning and intellectual arms, and to take up the new mission of the New Era Civil Affairs Association.
From 29 to 30 September, the National Political Consultative Conference convened in Beijing a seminar of the General Secretary of Xi Jinping on key ideological theories for strengthening and improving the work of the Association.
Wang Yang noted that, since the Party's eighteenth birthday, General Secretary Xi Jinping has proposed a new set of ideas and ideas for the strengthening and improvement of the work of the ACHD. For the first time, ACHD has been proposed as an important channel and specialized consultative body for the negotiation of socialist democracy, an important part of the system of State governance, an institutional arrangement with Chinese characteristics. For the first time, it has clarified the characteristics and advantages of the new party system, with a strong emphasis on the proper handling of the relationship between coherence and diversity. It has revealed the essence of the people's democracy that there are things to be negotiated and people's matters to be discussed. It has revealed the logical link between the “rule of China” and the Chinese political system, building on the deep theoretical thinking on the adherence to and development of the civil affairs system of good people. It is the most recent outcome of the Party's civil affairs co-opt.
Wang stressed the need for PACs at all levels to use theoretical studies as an opportunity to further identify weaknesses and shortcomings in the work of PACs and to work to strengthen and improve their efforts and achieve breakthroughs.
There is a need to strengthen the development of the PAC system in a comprehensive manner and to ensure that the deployment of the Party ' s central decision-making is fully integrated into the work of the PCC.
There is a need to strengthen intellectual and political leadership, to improve the system, procedures and mechanisms for political discourse and consensus-building, “two-way” and to translate intellectual and political leadership into all aspects and processes of performance.
Focusing on the Centre ' s mandate to fulfil its responsibilities, to be more subordinate to the Service Party and the State, to improve the quality and effectiveness of its mandate.
It is important to strengthen the Council ' s capacity-building, to train its commissioners and cadres, to play a fundamental role in the Commission, and to strengthen the basis on which the Council can carry out its functions.
There is a need to strengthen the guidance of the work of the local PACs, to direct, demonstrate and solve problems, and to raise the overall level of their work.
In order to further study and implement the spirit of Xi Jinping’s socialist ideas and party XIX of the Chinese character of the new era, the National System of Political Consultative Associations began, in May, with an important intellectual study and discussion campaign by the Secretary-General of Xi in order to strengthen and improve the work of the Association, convening eight regional and seven expert academic symposia, identifying 18 priority topics and six basic theoretical topics, with a total of 79.38 million members of the Committee and 279,000 officials of the various organs participating in the study and the discussion, resulting in more than 36,000 research papers.
In the light of the current wave of “public entrepreneurship, innovation for all”, the People's Network, Beijing, 5 November, electricity (Wan Xiaoyang), a growing number of science and technology companies have begun to focus on patent R & D and its associated protection, digging deep into the potential value of patents and gaining market dominance.
Similarly, there are a number of technology enterprises that have experienced significant abuses in terms of proprietary technology authorizations, the use of patented technology, and so on.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, Ho Changhong and Rabin, from Guangdong Province, applied to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court for patent infringement against the developer of the APP, Beijing Little Orange Technology Ltd. (hereinafter " Little Orange Technology " ), the operator drop-drop technology Ltd. (hereinafter " drop-off " ), and the seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Ltd. (hereinafter " Guangdong Pacific " ).
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately cease the manufacture, sale, promise and use of the plaintiff ' s patent.
On October 30, 2018, the Chinese Network of Judicial Documents published “Civil decisions of first instance in disputes over patent infringement of inventions, such as Tan Wei, Ho Hung and Beijing Orange Technology Ltd.”, revealing the details of some of the cases of patent infringement in which APPs were prosecuted.
The three plaintiffs argued that the patent owner and inventor of the “mobile terminal-based carpooling services system and methods” patent, while the entire operation of the “roll-by-roll” APP application corresponded to the technical programme of patent protection in question, constituting a patent infringement.
However, at the time of the Court's decision, OrangeTech concluded that the Guangdong Pacific was not a proper defendant, that it had provided on the Internet only free downloads of the APP “drop-outs”, that the patent method in question had not been applied, that there was no direct or indirect violation and that it should not be classified as the defendant in the present case.
Secondly, the violations in this case were not committed in Guangdong.
In accordance with the law, the tort of the patent in question was the place where the patent method was applied in its entirety, and the jurisdiction of the court was challenged, requiring the case to be referred to the court of the defendant ' s domicile, the Beijing Court of Intellectual Property.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, had supplied the alleged tort drop-off APP product on its web platform, and that the plaintiff was not inappropriate in including the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, as the defendant.
The defendant, Guangdong Pacific, also resides in Guangzhou City and is under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant, Orange Technology, argued that the case should be referred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, on insufficient grounds, rejecting the defendant, Orange Technology Ltd. ' s objection to the jurisdiction of the case and bearing the costs of the jurisdiction challenge.
Other proceedings in the case have not yet been made public, and journalists will follow closely the details of the patent infringement case.
Visit to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research: significant results of scientific and technical cooperation in Australia
“China’s science and technology has developed rapidly over the past decades, and the two countries of Australia and China, working together in the field of science, can achieve fruitful results.”
Larry Marshall, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research, in a recent interview with a Chinese News Agency journalist in Beijing, said that cooperation in the field of science and technology in Australia, from climate change to Sky-Eye cooperation, was a promising development.
As the largest national scientific research agency in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved numerous innovative research findings of world visibility in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“This is a lasting friendship, a friendship that embraces trust in partners and a long tradition of cooperation.” Marshall said.
Last May, China's 500-metre spherical radio telescope, China SkyEye, installed the first international 19-beam L-band receiver.
The 19-beam feed receiver, currently the most advanced in the world, was developed jointly by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall indicated that the successful development of the receivers was based on the accumulation of technology by CSIRO over the years and that, with the launch, the speed of the FEST cruise would increase by five to six times, and that more scientific observation objectives would be expanded.
"This is a contribution of CSIRO to FAST."
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO is working closely with Chinese scientific institutions on the construction of a square kilometre array radio telescope, the development of new fuel technologies, and the reduction of energy savings.
“In the past, scientific research has tended to focus on hundreds of years later, and now more scientific research is needed to solve the problems that lie ahead.”
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the area of scientific development, while both countries face a range of challenges in their development.
Extreme weather events, for example, are frequent worldwide, droughts and floods have led to reduced food production, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, the problems of population explosion, ageing and chronic diseases are also serious challenges.
“The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused primarily on solving these immediate difficulties.”
Marshall introduced the International Centre for the Study of the Southern Hemisphere Ocean, established by CSIRO in cooperation with the Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, which focused on observing the El Niño and La Niña phenomena, studying their relationship to extreme weather and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather; and the new varieties of cereals to overcome extreme weather, developed by CSIRO in cooperation with the Chinese Academy, could also alleviate the food shortage caused by extreme weather.
“In the current environment, where science, technology and innovation are difficult to accomplish on their own, very costly, and the number of issues to be addressed, cooperation is particularly important today.”
Marshall stated that the closer the cooperation, the greater the likelihood of ground-breaking progress, was also the significance of closer cooperation between the two parties in the context of the “one-way” framework.
“Strengthening bilateral cooperation, mainly in science and technology, for us.”
For example, Marshall, CSIRO has recently developed a gold-purification method that does not use cyanide, because the traditional cyanide gold-purification method is very harmful to the environment, and many countries hope to find a method of gold-purification that is less polluting to the environment.
“We are willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results of our participation in the ‘way-by-way’ cooperation.”
On 29th, in the city of Urumqi, Xinjiang, where BPW Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Co-operation was held, guests were able to appreciate the development of the BP as well as the local cuisine and the weight of the local historical culture.
During the first month of the event, a series of high-density, large-scale tourism promotion campaigns were conducted in eight cities along the Silk Road, namely, Tian Shui, Cool, Lanzhou, Silvergawa, Sienn, Zhang, Hami, and so forth, laying a good foundation for the successful launch of the 2018 Chicken Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Partnership Fair.
Huixin, Mayor of Po-Ching City, Shanxi Province, introduced the long history and industrial base of Po-chick, the second-largest city in Changxi Province and the sub-centre city of Guan-Tian Economic Zone and Guan-Puan city complex, as well as the important nodal city along the “One Way” initiative.
In recent years, the Pony City has continued to upgrade industrial clusters, logistics hubs, integrated services, open highlands, human cohesion and five functions, accelerating catch-up and high-quality development.
At the meeting, the Pony City Tourism Development Council and the Urumqi Tourism Authority signed two agreements on strategic cooperation in tourism.
At the same time, a number of Xinjiang travel agencies have signed cooperation agreements on tourism with the Bocai River tourist area, the Famen Temple Buddhist cultural site, the Tai White Mountain tourist area, and the Guan Shan prairie area.
“The Great American Xinjiang, where some of the tourism resources are complementary to the BPW, travels all the way to Xinjiang, with a focus on human chickens, fine chickens, natural wind, etc., selects more than 500 photos to make customers feel the beauty of the BP chicken.”
Focusing on tourism resources, tourism projects, tourism routes, etc., the event featured a comprehensive promotion of the entire Pony Tourism image, a high-quality tourism product and an excellent tourism industry project, the consolidation of the Xinjiang Source Market, a comprehensive singing of the brand “Look at China's Paw” and the promotion of the influence and visibility of the Pony City in the north-west, and the attraction of more Xinjiang tourists to the Pony Tourism Experience.
“In this event, the various departments, districts and development districts of the city actively engaged in discussions and coordinated the implementation of a large number of good projects and major projects.
To date, 41 contracted projects have been implemented, involving a total of 26.43 billion yuan. "
In recent years, the Pony has continued to upgrade industrial clusters, logistics hubs, integrated services, open highlands, human cohesion and five main functions around the goal of building internationalized cities along the “one-way” initiative, equipping manufacturing cities, historical and cultural names, and beautiful and happy cities with decent housing, and accelerating catch-up and high-quality development.
In 2017, total regional production reached 218 billion yuan, an increase of 8.7 per cent.
More than 20 national-level honours were awarded to civilized cities throughout the country, the National Ecoforestry City and the China Human Settlements Environment Award.
Urumqi's Standing Committee, Deputy Mayor Yan Namin, introduced Urumqi's special geographical advantage as a town in the new North Province on the Silk Road, connecting Tianshan North and South, communicating with Xinjiang and the interior, connecting China with Central Asia, West Asia and Europe, and an important window for China's opening to the West and its exchange of economic and cultural exchanges with the outside world, with a good investment climate.
The event, which focused on the manufacturing of equipment, logistics and commerce, the tourism industry and with the sincerity of the conspiracy to develop good opportunities and co-operative schemes, was a great event in Urumqi.
At the Xinjiang rally, local customers signed six projects with the Pony Districts, involving a sum of RMB 3.25 billion.
On the same day, foreign guests, such as representatives of the Kyrgyz visa service in Urumqi, the Russian neo-Siberian Law Company Limited, the Tajik Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Urumqi and the Russian Chamber of Commerce of Tatarstan, attended the discussion.
Some 500 members of the Urumqi Municipal Bureau of Recruitment, Commerce, Agriculture, Tourism, etc., as well as enterprises and the media participated in the discussion.
The revitalization of the north-east is a matter of national development.
Industrial enterprises in the north-east are more important and better based, and in the north-east, catching innovation is catching up with development, and innovating is looking for the future.
Is it possible to re-energize the old industrial base, release it and hold the General Secretary's heart?
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea, Mr. Lee Yong Ho, stated to the United Nations that the continued imposition of sanctions was deepening North Korea ' s mistrust of the United States and that it was impossible for the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea to unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
According to Lee Yong-ho at the United Nations General Assembly, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has adopted a “very friendly approach” over the past year, including the cessation of missile and nuclear tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and a commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“But we didn't see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we cannot give up weapons unilaterally.”
Although Lee Yong-ho echoed North Korea's complaints about the United States' opposition to “phased” denuclearization, his remarks were of great significance, as there was no total rejection of unilateral denuclearization, as the DPRK had done in the past.
Lee Yong-ho referred to Kim Jong-un and Trump's joint statement of 12 June, when Kim Jong-un agreed to work towards “denuclearizing the Korean peninsula” and Trump pledged to protect the security of the DPRK.
The DPRK has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has stated that the DPRK must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States also refused to relax the demand for international sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearizing first’ and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its objectives in a high-pressure manner, even refusing to issue the ‘Declaration on the End of War’,” Lee Yong-ho.
“The idea that sanctions can make us beg for forgiveness on our knees is that those who do not understand us are dreaming.
But the problem is that this continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Lee Yong-ho made no mention of the second Special Union plan referred to by the President of the United States earlier this week at the United Nations.
On the contrary, he highlighted the three meetings between Kim Jong-un and Korean President Veng in the last five months, saying: “If the other side of denuclearization is Korea, not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not become so frozen.”
China announced a reduction in import duties for 1,585 tax purposes with effect from 1 November 2018.
Since this year, China has taken successive initiatives to reduce import tariffs.
On 1 May of this year, there was a general tax reduction on medicines, with a total of 28 duty-free import duties adjusted to zero for all generic drugs, including anti-cancer drugs, as well as bioalkali-based drugs with anti-cancer effects, and Chinese-based drugs with actual imports.
At the same time, there has been a significant reduction in the value-added tax on the production and import of anti-cancer medicines.
On 1 July, there was a tax deduction for 218 tax purposes on automobiles and their parts and components.
As a result of the tax reduction, China ' s whole-car tax rate has been below the average in developing countries and is in line with the real situation in China ' s automobile industry.
This tax reduction will drive industrial restructuring and optimal resource allocation, accelerate success and underachievement, improve the quality of products and services, and are expected to contribute to some extent to the adjustment of automobile prices and increase the benefits to consumers.
On 1 July, there was a daily tax reduction on consumer goods for 1,449 tax purposes.
Tax reductions on consumer goods are closely linked to the needs of the people for a better life.
This tax reduction was not only large but also strong, with an average of 56 per cent.
Taxes on consumer goods are reduced on a daily basis, directly benefiting a wide range of consumers and contributing to the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On 1 November, a tax reduction will be imposed on industrial goods such as mechanical and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials for 1585 tax purposes.
Appropriately reducing tariffs on imports of much-needed industrial goods in some parts of the country can attract more foreign investment, contribute to more efficient domestic supply, boost industrial upgrading, and help enterprises to allocate resources on a global scale, reduce production costs, and reduce the pressure on the domestic environment.
The relevant head of the Office of the Customs and Excise Commission of the State Council of China stated that the four above-mentioned autonomous tax reductions, as well as the third step of this year ' s negotiations on the extension of the scope of the information technology agreement on 1 July, would reduce China ' s total tariff level from 9.8 per cent in the previous year to 7.5 per cent.
The overall level of adjusted tariffs is slightly higher than that of the EU and is lower than that of most developing countries, and is at a moderate low level, largely in line with China ' s developing country status and stage of development.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that, as one of the key indicators of China ' s openness in the area of trade in goods, the overall level of tariffs should be adapted to the stage of China ' s economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China ' s trade in goods is the world ' s largest in scale and already has an open economic base for further expansion, but the quality and efficiency of trade development are still far from being the same as that of developed economies, and therefore the overall level of tariffs should be reduced as appropriate.
Tariffs are a means of compliance protection, and tariff levels should be commensurate with industrial competitiveness, encouraging benign competition, and excessive protection is detrimental to industrial development and quality improvement.
Tariff rate adjustments need to be balanced between production needs and consumption needs.
The focus is on reducing the tax rates on commodities with high domestic demand, contributing to the upgrading of the industrial transformation, on increasing the import of niche niche products with more concentrated needs of the population, on increasing the sense of business and public access, and on meeting the upgrading needs of industrial and consumer structures.
Tax cuts need to balance fiscal revenues with the affordability of industrial development.
The choice of specific tax-reducing commodities and tax-reducing margins should be made in a way that harmonizes the two markets, both domestic and foreign, both upstream and downstream, production and consumption, and preserves the momentum of China ' s steady and moderate economic development.
The Officer-in-Charge stressed that this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the reform and opening of the country, and that China has taken the initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs in accordance with the major measures that China needs to achieve its own high-quality development, in order to facilitate the integrated use of both international and foreign resources, to promote the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system and to meet the needs of the population in terms of rising consumption.
These actions and initiatives demonstrate China ' s firm commitment to pursuing a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, its firm support for economic globalization, its determination to uphold the principles of free trade and the multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization as its core, and its continued efforts to harness the momentum of development from its opening up to the world, as well as to make China ' s development more beneficial to the world.
The President of Serbia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
It quoted information from the Office of the President of Serbia that President Vučić of Serbia had ordered the maximum operational readiness of the country ' s armed forces in view of the occupation by the Kosovo Special Forces of the access to the water storage lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station in northern Kosovo, which was controlled by Belgrade.
On 29 September, the Minister of Defence of Serbia, Wu Lin, declared that the Serbian army was in full operational readiness.
Wu Lin stressed that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as the orders issued by Vucic remained in force, and that the Army would respond regardless of the course of events.
According to TAS, on 29 September, Vucic stated in an interview that he had briefed the parties, including the United States and the European Union, on the current situation and would travel to Moscow on 2 October to meet with Russian President Putin and seek Putin ' s support on the issue of Kosovo.
When asked whether Serbia needed Russia’s military support like Syria, Vucic replied in the negative: “I do not want a major military conflict on our soil.”
Vucić also stated that the full operational readiness of the RSLA was only intended to create a deterrent to prevent the conflict, but it was also a clear warning that no violence would be tolerated in Kosovo.
The raising of the operational readiness of the RSLA is linked to two major Kosovo initiatives.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days the Albanian population in the northern part of Kosovo is engaged in mass arrests of Serbs who have been living there for generations and who are not in violation of any law.
Vucić claims that, since the beating and detention of Marko Juridge, head of the Serbian Government's office in Kosovo and Metohija, on 26 March this year, the Albanian community has escalated the situation in the region, carrying out inhuman arrests and expulsions of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the previously self-proclaimed ROSU Special Forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, armed police and snipers, occupied positions near the water storage lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric station, entered the ecological and sports centre near the dam in the northern part of Kosovo and blocked all nearby roads, which were otherwise controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucic pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo was instigated by Western countries and that the actions of the Kosovo Army had not been notified to the Serbian side in advance, in violation of chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the military-technical agreement between Serbia and Montenegro.
Vucic has already spoken to NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg, criticizing the hypocrisy of Western countries on the Kosovo issue.
The root cause of the current conflict remains the centuries-old historical feud between the two communities in Kosovo.
With regard to Kosovo's attribution, there is a difference between the Serb and Albanian communities.
Serbia views Kosovo as a national birthplace and a cradle of culture, as it established its most powerful State here in the 12th century, while ethnic Albanians moved in massively only after the Ottoman Empire invasion and the defeat of the Serbian army in the north.
The Albanians, for their part, maintained that the original tribe of Ilya, which lived in Kosovo in the fourth and fifth centuries B.C., was the ancestry of the Albanians and that Kosovo had been an Albanian territory since time immemorial.
Subjective political divisions have led to violent clashes among different ethnic, religious and cultural groups and to a fierce confrontation between the Serb and Albanian communities in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
In the wake of the First World War, a large number of ethnic Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, with a relative increase in the proportion of Serbs, which, in the view of the Serbs, “only take back their own land” was perceived by the ethnic Albanians as the plundering of “Greater Serbism” and fuelled by bi-communal contradictions.
Kosovo became the “powder bucket” of the Balkans.
In 1999, an armed conflict between the Albanian separatists of the KLA and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO forces and the outbreak of the war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its secession from Serbia.
Since then, despite the news that Serbia will normalize its relations with Kosovo and sign global and legally binding agreements, agreements that have been held hostage to various forces, such as the United States and the Russian Federation, have not been concluded owing to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints.
And just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he advocated the separation of Serbs from Albanians in Kosovo and once again publicized the conflict between the two communities.
Electricity is still out of order, and the Indonesian earthquake has been coupled with the tsunami.
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early hours of the morning of 30, a strong earthquake and tsunami in Dungara district, Central Sulawesi Province, in the country, resulted in 420 deaths.
The head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, Wilem Rampangilei, stated that the figure was only a preliminary count of the city of Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi, about 80 kilometres from the epicentre, where intensive buildings, such as hotels, malls, warehouses, etc., destroyed by the collapse of the earthquake, had not yet been searched, owing to the lack of large search and rescue machines.
On 29 September 2018, local time, in Balo, Indonesia, a bridge damaged by an earthquake and tsunami collapsed in several sections.
As a result of the severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, the earthquake in the Central Dungara district and the adjacent Sigi region remain unconnected “islands”, unable to account for the number of victims.
In this media report, Vice-President Kara of Indonesia reported the death toll of thousands of people.
Power cuts, communications disruptions, road blockages, airport damage...
As a result of the power cuts, some hospitals and rescue settlements in the city of Palu are dependent on fuel for electricity generation.
Roads into and out of the city were blocked by landslides and the lack of access of large transport vehicles, including tanker trucks, straining the supply of fuel.
According to the Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs, Agus, emergency relief supplies, such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothing, food, household kits and other emergency relief supplies from the departments of South Sulawesi and Columbus, adjacent to the earthquake zone, have not yet arrived in the affected areas as a result of road damage.
Disaster relief materials transferred from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported to the affected areas by air transport aircraft.
In view of the damage caused to the Palu airport command tower and runway during the earthquake, and in order to ensure safety and security of the rescue, all commercial flights have been suspended for the purpose of landing and landing only military aircraft transporting relief supplies and personnel.
The Indonesian Minister of Political, Legal and Security Affairs in charge of the rescue in the earthquake zone, Wiranto, called for the prompt resumption of electricity supply and airport commercial flight services in order to ensure the functioning of relief agencies, such as hospitals, and the arrival of more rescue workers and volunteers and aid supplies in the affected areas.
A series of strong earthquakes in Dungara district, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, triggered by a tsunami at 1702 hours, triggered by a 7.07-scale earthquake, caused major disasters in the cities of Palu, Dungara and Sigi.
In the recent past, Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky mode, bringing thousands of Kyotoers to the social platform, and enjoying happiness on the screen, saying, “In the blue sky, the ‘drinking’ skyline is the best card in Beijing.”
Since August, Beijing has welcomed the "Blueest Sky".
Within the city, people can be seen and photographed at any time or place with a smart phone, or with a single anti-camera.
On social platforms like Weibo, Weibo Circle of Friends, the palaces, Tiananmen, the nests, the alleys in the webcams everywhere, the buildings display different beautys under the blue sky.
Some netizens say that such a “windlight” is the best urban propaganda film in Beijing; others argue that if such a blue sky is brushed for a long time, people with cervical vertebrae can be cured; and even more, they hope that “the blue will last through the winter for spring and summer, so that the sky of the city will be blue all over the season”.
Why does the people of the city love the sky so much?
People who lived in this city in the past suffered from the fog, and so they longed for the blue sky, and after Beijing, when the “Blue Sky Defense War” was launched, the air quality continued to improve, the fog became less, the blue sky became more, and the happiness that people felt in their eyes was particularly important.
On the Fourth of July, the weather was clear in Beijing.
At 8 a.m., the vast majority of the 35 air quality monitoring stations throughout the city were shown to be “first-class” green.
The "Blueest Sky" thematic photography competition on social networking platforms, spontaneous by the people, is still going on.
Why is it so blue in Beijing these days?
According to the head of the Beijing City Environmental Protection Agency, the average concentration of fine particles (PM2.5) in Beijing in August of this year was 35 μg/m3, the best ever recorded for the last five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 in September was even more frequent in places.
A major factor in the emergence of the “Blueest Sky” is the overall favourable weather conditions in recent times and, more importantly, the persistence of atmospheric pollution control in Beijing, the vigorous promotion of clean air action plans over the past five years, the continued release of environmental benefits and the resulting reduction of total pollutant emissions in the region, all of which provide the basis for a sustained improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially launched and implemented the Beijing City Plan of Action for Clean Air 2013-2017 in 2013.
Under the plan, official efforts are continuously directed at defunctionalizing non-capital functions and promoting energy clean-up and pollution reduction, with a total of 4923 coal-fired boilers phased out.
As a result, Beijing became the first large city in China to become a net gas-free city.
The data show that between 2013 and 2017, the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased cumulatively by 35.6 per cent; the number of air quality days increased by 50 days; the number of first-best days increased by 25 days; and the number of days of heavy contamination decreased by a total of 35 days and the incidence of heavy contamination decreased significantly.
At the same time as air quality continues to improve, Beijing officially released in September this year the Beijing Three-Year Plan of Action to Win the Blue Sky Defense, based on a new round of PM2.5 sources, focusing on the current governance phase and pollution features, the priority areas of diesel trucks, dusting, volatile organic matter management, optimizing transport structures, industrial structures, energy structures and land use structures, strengthening regional alliances, strengthening city fine management, promoting green development across the board, and returning the “Blueest Sky” to Kyoto as a background rather than a protagonist.
During the Golden Week of the National Day, the relevant departments, such as the Municipal Tourism Board, the Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Municipal Administration, Public Security and others, will intensify their law enforcement checks on the “one-day” market, focusing on the “six-black” of tourism, and, once found to be in violation of the law, will be subject to severe and cumulative penalties in accordance with the law.
Yesterday morning, the municipality organized a special conference on the subject of the illegal “one day” and deployed a special operation to fight further the illegal “one day” “one day”.
At the conference, it was revealed that the focus on black votes, black guides, gangsters, black cars, black shops, black-net interest chains were interwoven with “six blacks”, and since 28 July the city has launched a special campaign against illegal “one-day” trips.
A total of 39 “one-day” complaints have been processed throughout the city, a decrease of 63 per cent over the same period; 270 “one-day” complaints have been processed throughout the city since this year, a decrease of 62 per cent over the same period.
Over the past two months, the city has seized 248 “black cars” for a total of 158 violations of the rules governing tourist passenger operations, closed down 29 shopping “black shops” and theatres, seized 13 “black houses” and 27 black guides, confiscated 26,000 illegal advertisements, removed 31 illegal “one day” billboards and 3 public transport placards, investigated 1789 offences involving various travels, opened 181 cases with heavy fines of $4.48 million and detained 111 persons involved in travel offences.
As a result of the clean-up, the illegal “one-day” chaos was largely contained, and the “one-day” market order became stable and positive.
In recent years, it has been reported that the city has been increasing its efforts to deal with illegal “one day” trips.
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission received 1612 and 897 “one-day” complaints, a decrease of 79 per cent and 44 per cent, respectively, but the illegal “one-day” continued to bounce, often rebound, and created a hysteria of the interwoven “six-blank” of the chain of interests, such as black ticketing, black-guiding, black-seller, black-seller, black-net, etc.
Specifically, illegal street tourists, i.e. “black ticketers”, illegal websites that publish false tourism information, i.e. “black nets”, travel agencies engaged in illegal “one-day” trips, or agencies or individuals without the qualifications of travel agencies, i.e. “mafia”, “black guides” employed by “mafia” who do not have a tour permit or practice in violation of the law, and vehicles used by them that do not have the qualifications to travel passengers or which provide passenger services for illegal “one-day” tours, i.e. “black cars”, which eventually bring tourists into designated tourist shopping shops, i.e. “black shops”.
As part of this campaign, the city has continued to increase the number of regular inspections and mobile patrols of illegal “one-day” trips. In response to the illegal “one-day” high-frequency and high-impact tourist route locations, the relevant authorities have sent daily undercover teams to carry out unannounced visits, and have found evidence of violations of the law, in accordance with the law.
Among them, the “black car” and the “black shop” were the two hard-hit priorities of the special operations.
It was reported that, without black cars, illegal “one-day” trips could not take place, and that black cars were easy to detect, remember and trace, as well as high-value fixed assets.
The authorities use road traffic surveillance probes to increase the supervision of the main “one-day” routes for bus trips, so that “black cars” can be detected in a timely manner, using technological and intellectual means such as anti-material defence.
The “black shop” of tourist shopping has also become a strong focus owing to its small number and location.
In order to reinforce the deterrence and suppression of illegal “one-day” trips, any special operation that is found to be in violation of the law is punishable by a heavier and heavier penalty, in accordance with the law.
In August of this year, the city also held a seminar on the legal aspects of the fight against illegal “one-day trips” to examine the means of combining administrative sanctions with convictions.
The Municipal Tourism Council has indicated that more regular travel agencies will be encouraged in the future to carry out a “one-day tour” of Beijing and to increase the supply of a formal “one-day” to further crowd out the illegal “one-day” living space, and that specific programmes are under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Council has continued to refine the e-Travel List information system to ensure that each team is included in the regulation of the e-Travel Platform.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economic symbol, what has U-town been through all these years?
As the permanent venue of the World Internet Congress, the town of Utun has received attention as to how to take on the summit dividend.
In the five years since the first World Internet Congress, changes have been visible in the town of Utun.
In 2014, there were only 12 businesses associated with the digital economy and the Internet throughout the town, and by the third quarter of this year there were more than 500 businesses.
This is a microcosm of the development of the digital economy in Utun.
The convening of the Internet Congress allowed local firms to accept the inspiration of the digital economy, the wave of digitization, the desire to upgrade their businesses, and the investment and research and development of traditional manufacturing firms in machine-changers, smart management, etc.
The Secretary of the U Township Party, Kang Yong, said that the town would build a new economic empowerment centre in the future.
The digital economy cannot be developed without the support of infrastructure.
This year, Uyghur launched a 5G pilot on the basis of the 4G communications network and free WiFi coverage.
At the same time, the city of Kirang, where the town is located, has become the hot ground for the development of the Internet industry, as the country ' s first county-level city to build dedicated access to international Internet data.
Since the first World Internet Congress, 565 digital economy projects have been introduced, with a total planned investment of 37.725 billion yuan, bringing the total value of the core manufacturing sector of the digital economy to 8.73 billion yuan in the first three quarters of the year, with a 13 per cent increase in value added.
"Ou Town was a tourist symbol, followed by theatre and cultural symbols. Because of the Internet Congress, it is now the Internet and the digital economy. "
In the view of the Secretary of the Quanty City Council, the dividends of the World Internet Congress have accumulated over time, making it all the more necessary to set up a platform for the accumulation and import of various elements, such as talent, projects, technology, etc.
Shen Yi, a villager, has worked outside the country for 20 years and returned home to start a business as a result of her association with the Internet Congress.
On 2 December last year, with his high-capacity anti-digital modification technology solution, he entered the fourth Internet Light Fair, which was favoured by a number of clients.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in U-town not only because of her home country, but "In U-town, it's easier to attract people than I thought, and our applications are quick to land, and we have applications in U-town's smart parking program."
The spill-over effect of the Internet Congress is reflected in a town hall road.
This road to the north and south of the city of Kiryu is not only a series of tourist attractions, but also an industrial road.
With this as its foundation, the U.S. Boulevard created a conglomeration.
Journalists have learned that, in the future, Utun Avenue will become the leading position in the development of the Qing township industry, leading the way in the massive application of the fruits of smart medicine, wise old age, wise government, and so on, bringing together industries and a large number of high-level talent, which account for 80 per cent of the city ' s GDP.
The tsunami caused by the earthquake in Indonesia has killed at least 410 people.
According to the evening 29 of the Director of the Public Information Bureau of the Indonesian police in Jakarta, the current earthquake in Central Sulawesi province has killed 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified.
A further 29 persons were missing and 540 injured.
Palu airport is still in a state of closure.
Active treatment, with 98% of premature child survival in China for 29 weeks and over, has reached the level of developed countries.
The National Children's Medical Center and the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Gangan revealed on 30 September that it introduced Canada's advanced methods in the title “China's NiCU Prenatal Quality Improvement Project”.
The results of the project show that, after active treatment, 98 per cent of premature child survival in China over 29 weeks of age has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in early delivery without complications in very young babies.
For almost 20 years, the Chinese Government has been focusing on the treatment of newborn children.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has fallen to 3.71 per 1,000, significantly below the national average and at advanced levels in developed countries.
The “China NIOC Project for Pre-natal Quality Improvement of Pre-born Children in Hospital” has, through four years of tireless efforts, significantly improved the quality of survival of pre-born children.
Professor Cao Yun, Director of the Neonatal Care Unit (NICU) of the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Mudan, stated to journalists that, while increasing the survival rate of premature births, attention is being paid to reducing the quality of premature child survival, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the overall outcome of neurodevelopment, and improving the overall survival and demographic quality of premature babies, which is a major concern of the paediatric and neonatal communities, both at home and abroad, as well as of the project.
The “China NiCU Project for the Improvement of Premature Quality of Premature Births in Hospital” has worked tirelessly for four years to include tens of thousands of premature births of 33 weeks of age and under, resulting in a one-third reduction in infant mortality in the country, as well as a significant reduction in the incidence of serious complications in premature births and a significant improvement in the quality of the survival of premature births.
Through the establishment of the National Neonatal Quality Improvement Coordination Network and the introduction of the concept of collaborative Quality Improvement, 25 collaborating hospitals across China have been remitted to create a comprehensive, systematic and effective collaborative Quality Improvement methodology adapted to the national context to improve pre-natal care and to improve the quality of care for newborn children.
The Paediatric Hospital, affiliated with the University, is working with the National Newborn Unit to develop guidelines for the treatment of neonatal infections, based on the project ' s experience, and to provide reference and guidance for the regular treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the “China Project for Pre-natal Quality Improvement of Pre-born Children”, the Paediatric Hospital introduced the EPIQ methodology into 25 large NNICUs in 19 provinces of the country, in an effort to address the problem of premature child infections in China's neonatal care unit.
After more than a decade of continuous improvement, the survival rate of premature births in Canada has increased by about a third, and Canada is now one of the best countries in the world to expect premature births.
The EPIQ methodology has now been applied to all NIOCs across Canada and has been adopted in six countries.
According to the paediatric hospital, two years after EPIQ intervention, premature childhood infections fell by 35 per cent, while antibiotics use fell by 20 per cent.
In the future, the Paediatric Hospital, affiliated to the University of Retan, will continue to promote and implement this methodology nationwide, with a view to reducing the overall incidence of all complications in premature births and improving the quality of care for newborns throughout the country.
At the present time, there is an indisputable fact that the level of care available in all regions of China varies and is not evenly balanced.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important building unit of the National Children ' s Medical Centre, the Paediatric Hospital will play a radiological role. The study will cover the western provinces of Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal care throughout the country.
It is understood that the Paediatric Hospital, affiliated with the University of Mudan, is working with the National Newborn Unit to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections, based on the project ' s experience, and to provide reference and guidance for the regular diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
In 2019, it was revealed that the focal point, the China Neonatal Collaboration Network, located at the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Gangan, would join 63 hospitals across the country to carry out the next phase of national quality improvement, with a view to promoting the equalization of levels of neonatal care in China.
The Director of the Shanghai City Health and Planning Commission expressed alarm that Shanghai could become a central city in the centre of Asia, not only in terms of research, but also in terms of the development of the entire service system, and that the quality and results of services should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China ' s level of health care.
Episode: Build the “hero monument” in mind — written on the fifth anniversary of the martyr.
On 30 September, on the eve of the birth of the Republic ' s 69th birthday, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of the Martyrs ' Day, when the Xi Equality Party and the National Leader came to Tiananmen Square to attend a ceremony to honour the people ' s heroes.
At this juncture, no matter where you are, please pay a warm tribute.
It's a day of rejuvenation, and it's a wake-up call.
Turning a heavy history, the name of every martyr is behind a living life.
They also have hot youth, true love, family.
However, because of their conviction that “our faithism is the truth of the universe”, they are willing to sacrifice everything they have in order to save the suffering of the next generation.
"I live one day and cry for China one day."
Through time and space, the British set up a spiritual sign to guide the way forward.
"Where to come from, where to go," "Do what kind of person," read English, and it's easy to come up with an answer.
The memory of the Angry and, above all, the building of a “hero monument” in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the beginning of the Revolutionary War, some 20 million martyrs have lost their lives to national independence, the liberation of the people and the country ' s prosperity.
For a variety of reasons, many of the vanguards did not even leave their names.
Countless blood pours on the ideals, living in faith, bearing in mind their names, passing on their spirits, is the defence of the roots and spirits of the nation.
This "hero monument" is not subject to any degradation or destruction.
For some time now, historical nihilism, general entertainment, etc., have flourished.
All practices that distort history, demean and challenge the just conscience, miscalculate value judgements and provoke public outrage and alarm across society.
Strength must not be desecrated, and heroes must not forget.
It cannot be allowed to touch the bottom line, but it must be dared to shine a sword and defend the great dignity with justice based on the rule of law.
On 1 May of this year, the Heroed Martyrs Protection Act was officially implemented.
In judicial practice, the verdicts in a number of cases have been very encouraging, both for the effective preservation of the luminous image in accordance with the law and for the release of the positive energy of heroism and respect for the vanguard.
A people with aspirations cannot without heroes, and a country with ideals cannot without vanguard.
The memory of the vanguard and the call for heroes has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of memorial facilities throughout the country, with over 100 million visits to Martyrs' Gardens every year.
The hearts and minds are the strongest cornerstones.
Let the spirit of heroism, the defence of heroism, the study of heroism, the love of heroism, the integration of spirit into national bloodlines, and a “hero monument” will stand between the heavens and the earth, deep in hearts and minds.
Reuters, 28 September – The EU took a non-confrontational position against Italy on Friday, following Italy’s surprise with its massive budget deficit plan, in defiance of the EU’s demands, but the EU might take a more radical stance if Italy were to insist on too ambitious a goal.
The Italian skeptical government’s target of a budget deficit of 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) for the next three years suggests that debt cuts have not been achieved only in the face of the demand for a reduction in the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).
The EC's Executive Committee for Economic Affairs, Moscovisi, said on Friday, “We have no interest in the crisis between the EC and Italy,” and he responded cautiously because the EU's recommendations and sanctions could have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will be able to convince Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy formally submits it to the EC in mid-October.
Following the announcement by the Government of its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in almost two weeks on Friday, while the rate of return on Italian bonds reached its highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remained unchanged by the October deadline, the EC Committee might veto the Italian draft budget, something that the EC Committee had never done to any country.
The EU Executive Committee's Vice-President, East Bromsky, later in a meeting in Riga, Latvia, on Friday, stated that Italy's current financial plan “does not seem to be in line with the Stability and Growth Pact”, referring to the EU's financial provisions.
But he did not say how this would trigger a reaction from the EU.
Bidders may submit their applications to participate in this open tender by 26 October of this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture had identified China as one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
In May, the Russian Agricultural Supervisory Authority announced that, for the first time in the current agricultural year, Russian food exports to China exceeded 1 million tons, a record of innovation.
The Agency predicts that China may enter the top 10 Russian food-importing countries.
After Sapporo, on 30 September, the Chinese women ' s platoon won the Turkish team again by 3:0 on 30 September, after the first battle against Cuba at 3:0, and won two consecutive World Cups in 2018.
However, Chinese women are more vulnerable than they were during the first war.
A total of 24 teams participated in the 2018 World Exodus, with Chinese women in Group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
From the world ranking and overall strength of Team B, the Turkish and Italian teams are the main opponents of the Chinese team.
As soon as the game began, the Chinese team took the lead at the beginning of the game, maintaining the advantage throughout the process, putting a lot of pressure on the opponent to take the first round at 25:18.
In the second round, the Turkish team, which was in its grip, was so aggressive that it took the lead by 6:2 and the Chinese team, which requested a pause, adjusted its formation to 7 even-handedly, and then stopped the net scores by a number of times, with a score of 7:0; the Turkish team at the end of the bureau, which at one point ran to 15:19; the Chinese team, at 24:20, followed the hard-core Turkish team by another 2 points; and the Chinese team, once again, requested a pause to win the second round with Joting's running.
In the third round, the situation was so repulsive that the two sides rose from one to the other, and at one point it was 19 flat.
At a critical time, when the Turkish team made a mistake, the Chinese team took the lead by 21:19, then obtained the point at 24:21 with Juting's heavy-handed killing and Zhang's offensive; then the Turkish team pursued the score to 23:24, and after the Chinese team requested a pause, Zhang Chang'ing hit the score, and the Chinese team won by 25:23.
The whole game was not easy, as China's female platoon leader, Mr. Pingsai, said.
“We are better prepared, we are better at blocking the net, the Turkish team is more sophisticated, and we must reduce our mistakes and strive to win by our own initiative.”
In the face of the familiar teammates of the past, Jo Ting, who worked for the Vakiv Bank of Turkey, was subjected to a lot of restrictions in the first round of the competition that day, and she continued to carry out a strong offensive after her initiative to change.
“The enemy is familiar with each other, and it is normal to be watched, but the Chinese team is extremely active, and both the net and the attack are doing well in the face of bad news.”
Next, the Chinese women ' s platoon will hold a truce on World War I for physical and technical training; on 2 October, it will meet the third rival, the Canadian team.
On the 30th of September of the 30th, the China-China Network of Isolation (CHO Jiping Wang Peng) held a ceremony to focus on the implementation of the project in the second half of 2018 in the Hebei High School of Water.
Six projects were concentrated on that day, with a total investment of RMB 4.29 billion.
On that day, the Deputy Mayor, Yang Shikun, the Standing Committee of the Committee, announced the commencement of work.
According to Yao Hwan, the Director of the Hebei High-Level Committee for the Management of the New District, the six projects that have been launched today, with a total investment of $4.29 billion, are industrial projects, ranging from the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries to the introduction of new and emerging industries, covering a wide range of industries, such as civil-military integration, cloud factories, food, medicine, chemicals, etc., with high scientific and technological content, high industrial levels and high value added of products.
It is believed that the construction and commissioning of these projects will give a strong impetus to the early achievement of the goal of “building hundreds of billions of industrial parks and creating national high-rises”.
The project began with the announcement of the Deputy Mayor, Yang Shi Kwan, of the Standing Committee of the Water and Sanitation Committee.
Happily, Yao said that the region had successfully launched a series of major events, such as the China Quantico International Life Science Summit and the Great Health Industry Development Forum, the Chinese Academy of Sciences High-end Equipment Industry Summit, and the 2018 Qingjin Qingjin “By-Synchronous” Innovation Forum, which had led to the development of three strategic and emerging industries: new materials energy, health, and high-end equipment.
The Central American stem cell project will be officially operational by the end of the year.
The mid-level pilot base of the entire Central Science and Technology Project began construction on the country ' s first, the world ' s largest megawatt supercritical carbon dioxide compressor experimental platform.
The state-of-the-art super-counting centres, which are among the top 10 in the world, have been re-established in the provinces and cities.
Happily, Yao said that by the end of the year, the region will have completed Phase 2 of the Science and Technology Valley Project, which is 240,000 square metres of digital information, new energy materials, three research and development bases and a demonstration centre, among others.
The “upgrading” of the Chinese Academy+ innovation model will be actively developed, and a “one platform, one platform, one platform,” with multidisciplinary, multi-unit and multi-industry integration, will be built to promote the integration of scientific and technological results into innovation.
Nearly a thousand state-owned areas have reduced the price of tickets by more than half by more than 20 per cent.
[Summary] As of 28 September, 981 sites have been declared free of charge or price reduction measures (74 free of charge or 907), with price reductions in Yunnan Ishi Lam, Dalian Three Towers, Yulong Snow Mountain, Guangxi Quilin River, Fujian Wumao Mountain, Hunan Zhang Ji family border, Zhang Xi Ma Xian, Jiang Qingshan, Xinjiang Karnas and Xinjiang Xinjiang.
In follow-up to the Central Economic Work Conference and the deployment of the Government's report on its work, the National Development Reform Commission issued, on 28 June, the Guidance for Improving the System of Prices of State-owned Marketgates (hereinafter referred to as the Guidance) for Reducing Prices of Key State-owned Places, which calls for improving the mechanism of price formation of State-owned Marketgates through a rational definition of the cost composition of gate price pricing, innovative methods of price management, strict compliance with pricing procedures, and ensuring tangible results by the end of September in reducing the price of high State-owned Marketgates.
Active efforts have been made to respond to deployment requirements, with successively lower prices for tickets to key State-owned sites.
As of 28 September, 981 sites (74 free of charge, 907 reduced prices) had been declared free of charge or price reduction measures in place or issued to the public, of which 5A, 159, 4A, 534 or a total of 693, or 70.6 per cent, were in 5A and 4A, respectively.
Of the 907 landscape areas with reduced prices, 491, or 54.3 per cent, fell by more than 20 per cent, and 214, or 23.6 per cent, fell by more than 30 per cent.
The provinces of Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi and Shaanxi have a higher number of price-declining areas, of which Yunnan has more than 100, with an overall decrease of more than 30 per cent.
The government of the eight provinces (districts, municipalities) has set a total price reduction for the 5A scenario.
The high level of social interest in Yunnan Ishi Lam, Dalian Santa, Yulong Snow Mountain, the Guangxi Guiling River, Fujian Wumui Mountain, Hunanji Zhangji border, Xianxi Maasai, Jiangxi Sanshan, Xinjiang Karnas, etc., imposed price reductions.
The gradual return of the prices of tickets to priority State-owned sites to reasonable areas has contributed to the acceleration of the tourism sector ' s transition from a ticket economy to an industrial economy, to tourism for the general population, to tourism for the destination, and to the development of a virtuous circle of optimal tourism supply structures and steadily expanding demand for tourism consumption, as well as to the sustained and healthy development of the landscape and tourism industry.
At the same time, the National Development Reform Commission has emphasized the need to strengthen price order norms in the landscape, to guide the upgrading of services in the landscape and to ensure that price reductions are not reduced.
In addition, the National Development Reform Commission has carried out special inspections of the recent media reports on the disproportionate and apparent decline in the prices of individual tickets in the landscape, requiring serious local responses to social concerns in a timely manner and the effective implementation of price reductions.
The Trade and Development Board is in an orderly process of short-, medium- and long-term optimization
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Agency has submitted short-, medium- and long-term optimization reports on “Major Investment Migrants” and “Technology Migrants” and, in addition to intensifying the promotion and implementation of the work in the report, has been continuously listening to society and optimizing its content and related work.
The Trade and Development Board will brief all sectors of society as soon as possible on relevant optimization efforts.
Of these, five were short-term measures carried out in the course of the year; five were medium-term measures carried out in 2019; and one was long-term.
In addition, the Trade and Development Bureau has been instructed by the Director of the Department of Economic and Financial Affairs, Liang Witt, to undertake a comprehensive review of the internal management system.
The five short-term measures undertaken during the year include:
1. Carry out a review process. Priority is given to cases that are due to expire at the end of seven years, to those referred to in the ICAC report, and to cases of renewal. If there are indications of irregularities or violations, they will be referred to the relevant judicial authorities on their own initiative for follow-up;
Field visits to projects involving “major investment migrants”. By late September, more than 20 investment projects had been visited;
A comprehensive review of the current system of evaluation. Six principles for the analysis of investment projects have been re-established with regard to the evaluation of applications for “major investment migrants” and the approval mechanism will be improved with the identification of elements conducive to the development of the country, as well as with regard to the preferential admission of talent. A list of “Ten jobs in the five sectors” has been drawn up as an annual priority for the introduction of talent, in line with the HKSAR Government's policy direction, with a view to better targeting the recruitment of talent;
4. Increased transparency of information, including the planned step-by-step publication of approval guidelines, rating criteria and weights, as well as further refinement and public approval of data, starting in the fourth quarter of this year;
5. In terms of refining the work of the confirmation mechanism, prior confirmation of the status of work in Australia has been requested; significant investments must be verified on site and financial statements submitted.
The five medium-term measures implemented in 2019 included:
1. Establishment of a mechanism to hear the views of the Commission on Talent Development and the Economic Development Commission on a regular basis, including a working session with the Economic Development Commission in September to discuss the establishment of the mechanism.
2. Requires the applicant to submit annually financial statements made by an independent third party to keep the operation of the investment project under review;
3. Further standardization and electronicization of the process for the application and approval of individual cases in order to reduce human error;
4. To conduct a comprehensive review of the current staffing situation in order to complement the implementation of a number of optimization measures;
5. To intensify the study on the revision of the Temporary Residence System for Investors, Managers and Specially Qualified Technicians.
As for the long-term measures, the study on the revision of the law has intensified, and it is expected that the drafting of the legislation will take place in the first half of 2019, with a view to completing it as soon as possible, further clarifying the criteria for granting temporary residence permits, the review mechanism and the confirmation mechanism, as well as the investigation function of the Trade and Promotion Bureau, with a view to more precise processing and supervision of applications for temporary residence permits.
The national experts in the field of observation and exchange of research and studies of the membrane tampons entered the test field to hear a presentation by the representative of the Chinese Engineering Institute's team of Shirosan.
Xinjiang Xinjiang Shaya on September 30, was located at the Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Xiaoye district, where the membrane cotton plant test site, the giraffe, was “no worse” than the next membrane cotton, and a white cotton race was “open” with its branches.
From 27 to 28 September, a national on-site observation and discussion exchange on the membrane cotton was held in Xinjiang Shaya District.
During the videoconference, journalists learned that the immeasurable cotton technology system, which is dominated by the “Chinese cotton 619” and its accompanying cultivation measures, has initially achieved the goal of immeasuration of cotton fields, reduced the contamination of the ecological environment and the raw cotton by the Xinjiang cotton membranes, and made significant progress in the research and demonstration of the membrane cotton complex.
The Chinese Academy of Engineering, the famous cotton genetic breeder, and the Chief Scientist of the cotton system of the National System of Modern Agro-Industrial Industries (SINTAM) have given a presentation on the development of membrane cotton to the Secretary of the Zhejiang Agro-Lin University School Party, the National Model.
“The combination of membrane cotton technologies that we have developed can fully achieve the non-membrane cropping of cotton, and can completely solve the problem of membrane contamination and achieve green cotton planting.”
The Chinese Academy of Engineering has a quick introduction.
Xinjiang, the most important cotton-producing region in China, accounted for 61 per cent of the country ' s cotton area in 2017, according to the National Statistical Office, with 35 million acres of cotton cultivated in Xinjiang.
Since the introduction of the membrane in China in 1982, Xinjiang has had over 50 million acres of crop cover of all types, with annual usage of about 300,000 tons of membranes.
The cotton membrane coverage reached 100 per cent, and the cotton-field membrane accounted for about 60 per cent of the use of the membrane in Xinjiang.
The production of membrane cotton is measured, and the production of cotton is well within the range of 320 to 350 kg acre production.
As the amount of Xinjiang membrane inputs increases, the residual membrane recovery rate is low, the amount of film residues in the soil is gradually increasing, and a range of problems, such as the structural destruction of the soil caused by the membranes, seriously affect the sustainable development of agriculture.
Framing membranes not only cause significant contamination of the soil, but also have a significant impact on the quality of cotton fibres.
Currently, more than a third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang are mechanized.
In 2017, Xinjiang's Xinjiang aircraft collected approximately 14 million acres of cotton.
During the mechanical cotton harvesting process, a large amount of membrane on the surface and on cotton strains was collected, and the membrane mixed with the original cotton was difficult to remove during the processing of the original cotton, as well as during the subsequent textile processing, which severely affected the quality of textile products.
On 28 September, a national on-site observation and discussion exchange on the membrane cotton was held in Xinjiang Shaya district.
In an effort to address the problem of cotton-field membrane contamination, simplify cotton-planting techniques, and improve cotton-field efficiency, it is a matter of urgency that led his team through eight years to implement the “Chinese 619” membrane-free cotton cultivation, “building the wings” for the green development of Xinjiang's agriculture.
A simple example of this is the development, through innovative breeding of new ideas, of a very early, salin-resistant, cryogenic, high-yielding, land-based cotton novel called “Medium 619”.
“The ‘Medium 619’ achieved a series of accompanying measures, such as mechanical support for membrane sowing, improved depth of sowing, shallow burial of the drip pipe under membrane conditions, suitable screening for sowing density, sound chemical regulation, etc., under filmless cultivation in the southern part of Xinjiang.”
Demonstration bases for membrane cotton have now been established in Aksu, Kurr, Alar, etc., with production reaching 4,800 kg per hectare.
Cropping cotton without membrane achieved high yields, savings, environmental protection and combined efficiency gains.
Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang's agronomist Zhang Jianhai said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration on the technology of membrane cotton cultivation, an acre production of between 320 and 350 kg could be fully achieved, possibly even higher.
“The prospects for the diffusion of membrane cotton cultivation technologies are great.”
Zhang Jinghai believes that the current technology of membrane cotton cultivation can solve the problem of soil permeable membrane contamination once and for all, but that there is a gap between the current economic benefits and those of membrane cultivation.
“Affirmation of the purchase price of cotton will be conducive to future diffusion.”
He and his team will continue to carry out in-depth studies and wide-scale extension applications of the membrane cotton industry as the next step, using the membrane cotton industry as a powerful and definitive solution to the soil pollution caused by the membrane.
Guangdong Sea, Land and Air is actively responding to the Golden Week transport - China New Network
On 29 September, the seventh day of the official passage of the high-speed Hong Kong section, and the first weekend following the opening, the insider of the West Kowloon Station was hoisted.
The holiday of the Golden Week of the National Day (1-7 October) will take place around the clock, and journalists have learned from the relevant sectors that the various transport sectors, such as the Guangdong Railway, Air, Naval, Road, etc., are actively planning to increase their capacity to deliver and put in place safeguards to ensure the safe and orderly movement of passengers within the country during the Golden Week.
According to China Railway Guangzhou Bureau Group Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Huang Iron Group”) during the Golden Week of the National Day this year, Guangqiang is expected to transport 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 155,000 times and an increase of 9.2 per cent over the same year.
In order to meet the travel needs of passengers, the Guangqun Group plans to drive 104 additional high-speed trains and 85 additional high-speed trains, mainly on hot-gate lines such as Kyooka, Jiakun, Guangdong and Hang High-Trail.
Guangzhou Bai Yun Airport, which will be the busiest airport in the interior during the Golden Week of the National Day this year, is expected to receive more than 1.4 million passengers and to fly more than 9,200 flights.
With the increasing number of international routes, the airport is expected to see a significant increase in international passengers compared to the past, which will be a significant feature of the Golden Week holiday this year.
Singapore, Bangkok, Phuket, Jakarta, Colombo, Maldives, Manila, etc., are known to be the hottest cities for this year's national holiday, while the hot spots of Kathmandu, Kuala Lumpur, Bali, etc., have also continued to explode, with some flights “on the run”.
In particular, some airlines have increased their operations by adding one new flight per day to Shenzhen Shenzhen, one new flight per day to Guangzhou-Huni, one new flight per week to Guangzhou-Tehran to Iran-Mahan, and one flight per week to Viet Nam-Gongzhou-Huni to Viet Nam-Huni.
In order to ensure the protection of vacations, the White Cloud Airport has increased the security of priority posts such as “space allocation” “bag security” “on-call service” and “passenger security” and is prepared for extensive delays in the disposal of flights.
According to China’s Southern Airlines, this year’s Golden Week is a hot week for New Zealand, North America and Japan, while flights to tourist destinations in China’s interior, such as Hainan, Chengdu, Chenzhou, Xiaohua Mountains, Rim Mountain, Yellow Mountain, etc., are also relatively tight.
The Plan ' s gold week saw an increase of 50 flights, including 10 flights to and from Chiang Mai in Guangzhou.
According to the Guangdong Maritime Agency, prior to the festival, serious security risks had been investigated against key ships such as the Waterseed Tour Vessel, the June Strait passenger ferry, the Pearl River Express high-speed passenger ship, the ferry ferry, etc., to ensure a stable situation with regard to the safety of the water traffic during the extended vacation period.
During the Golden Week, traffic in Guangdong Province is expected to be at the top of the Chinese list.
The Guangdong Transport Group recently issued a guide to the holiday highway, which is expected to increase by about 12 per cent.
The General Directorate of Market Supervision has recently issued a circular on the strengthening of the regulation of market prices during the Mid-Autumn Year 2018, which calls for the strengthening of price regulation in the area of housing rental and real estate, the tightening of rent collusiveness, the hoarding of rental sources, the fabrication of false information to raise rents, the excessive charging of fees in the form of bundled services, the publication of misleading price information, and price irregularities such as unknown codes.
The circular made it clear that the early warning of price monitoring needs to be strengthened, with close attention to market price developments.
There is a need to pay close attention to the basic necessities of food and oil consumption, such as egg and milk salt, as well as to market and price changes for special commodities consumed by the local population on holiday, and to strengthen price monitoring and early warning analysis.
Once the tendentious and precipitous nature of market volatility is identified, timely measures are taken to address it effectively.
There is a need to strengthen surveillance and inspection of the wholesale retailing of necessities of life, to increase the frequency and regulation of areas closely linked to the daily consumption of the population, such as supermarkets, agro-trade markets, and to urge operators to operate in good faith in accordance with the law.
The circular noted the need to strengthen the focus area inspections and create a favourable consumer environment; to strengthen the regulation of the price of State-owned market tickets; to focus on violations such as non-implementation of government-mandated price levels or floating margins in State-owned areas; the unauthorized addition of charge items; the increase in the price of tickets by means of irregularities such as “campus” tickets; high pricing discounts; tied sales; the non-compliance with prescribed specifications; the non-implementation of preferential measures; price additions; and the imposition of surcharges.
The circular requires increased regulation of the price of essential goods, particularly agricultural products.
The prices of essential agricultural products, such as vegetables, pork, etc., have fluctuated in some regions in the recent past, as a result of seasonal variations, natural disasters and outbreaks.
Locally, the market price regulation of agricultural by-products needs to be strengthened, taking into account local realities, in order to coordinate the efforts of the relevant sectors to stabilize production and market supply, and to organize market-focused inspections and random spot checks.
Increased scrutiny of commodities such as pig meat, which is in short supply, with higher prices, and serious violations of the law, such as the hoarding of quirks, price hikes, collusive price hikes, etc.
The circular noted the need to strengthen price regulation in the areas of housing rental and real estate.
In the autumn of Mid-Autumn, the National Day, which coincides with the high season of rental housing and sale of goods, attention is drawn to the price behaviour of real estate enterprises, intermediaries and housing rental-related enterprises, the harsh regulation of rent price collusiveness, the hoarding of rental sources, the fabrication of false information to raise rents, the indiscriminate charging of fees in the form of bundled services, the publication of misleading price information, the price of unknown codes, etc., the violation of the law, the increased scrutiny of price labels for hot-selling buildings and real estate intermediaries, the failure to comply with the requirement to impose a “one standard” on consumer interests, the disruption of market order, the cleaning of the real estate market environment, and the creation of an open and transparent price order in the real estate market.
The circular referred to the need to ensure effective price regulation in other parts of the tourism industry, to regulate price order in catering, accommodation, shopping, sightseeing, entertainment, parking, etc., to guide operators in their biding and billing efforts, and to seriously investigate price violations of all kinds.
The circular stated that the inspection of transport prices, such as roads, railways, civil aviation and water transport, should be intensified, and that violations such as price increases, extra-price charges, non-fixed pricing, etc., should be seriously investigated.
Implement a “green corridor” for the transport of fresh agricultural products and a policy of free toll-free minibuses on major holidays.
Innovative regulatory instruments and methods of work are needed to strengthen the dissemination of price laws and regulations for off-line retail businesses and e-commerce platforms, to urge operators to improve their price promotion programmes, and to investigate, in accordance with the law, offences such as false original prices, misleading price indications, and non-compliance with price commitments.
The press was informed on 1 January that, on the fifteenth anniversary of the full passage of the Hong Kong train, three lifts had taken place and that the flow of passengers had so far been increasing; the cumulative total number of passengers travelling to and from the port had reached 1.7 million.
At the same time, Hong Kong and Australasia passenger clearances do not exceed 15 seconds.
On 1 October 2003, the State Council approved the establishment of a temporary crossing between Shanghai and Kowloon direct train, the first direct long-distance rail passenger crossing to Hong Kong in China, which marks the opening of a “three-wing” overland port in Shanghai.
To date, the Hong Kong train has been in operation for 15 years.
On the one day of the Shanghai Railway border inspection, which was tasked with the border check of the port's entry and exit, it was revealed that, from the start of the operation to the present day, there had been three lifts in the port's train, which had been reduced from almost 30 hours to 19 hours on a one-way basis; that the annual average traffic of incoming and outgoing passengers had increased from less than 80,000 to more than 150,000; and that, over the past 15 years, the total number of passengers travelling to and from the port had cumulatively broken 1.7 million.
Over the past 15 years, it has been reported that the Shanghai Railway Border Checkpoint for entry and exit has signed a police coordination mechanism with the station along the nine trains, and that police officers have been assigned on-the-road supervision, providing full coverage of 1991 km of services and controls.
Over the past 15 years, the Shanghai Railway Border Post has detected nearly a thousand cases of violations of the law, and has successfully solved cases of illegal immigration of foreigners with false permits, and of fraudulent departures with other persons ' documents, among others.
The station has also established mechanisms such as a work exchange with the Joint Inspection Unit, conducted regular training exercises for the Integrated Counter-Terrorism Service at the railway ports, and worked with the joint defence unit to construct the third-tier moored river protection belt at the roundabout railway crossings.
It is known that, over the past 15 years, the Shanghai Railway border control sector has continued to innovate in its services and the speed of customs clearance has increased significantly.
The border post has also set up a volunteer service group called “Joran” to provide loving assistance to the elderly, pregnant women and travellers with babies.
On 30 June, the press learned from the Ministry of Finance that the Ministries of Finance, the State Tax Administration, the National Development Reform Commission and the Commerce Department had recently issued a joint circular to further encourage foreign investors to invest in China, allocating profits to foreign investors from residential enterprises in China for the purpose of withholding the application of the pre-tax policy on domestic direct investment, and extending the foreign investment incentive category to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and areas.
This policy has been in effect since 1 January 2018.
The circular makes it clear that direct investment by offshore investors with a share of profits, including recapitalization by offshore investors with a share of profits, new construction, equity acquisition, etc., does not include the addition, conversion, acquisition of shares in listed companies, in addition to eligible strategic investments.
Offshore investors who are provided with a policy of withholding income tax but who are not actually entitled to it may apply to recover the policy within three years of the actual payment of the tax in question and refund the tax paid.
Moreover, foreign investors who, after enjoying the prescribed withholding of tax policy treatment, are subject to special reorganization conditions in the event of a reorganization of an investment enterprise and are actually taxed in accordance with a special reorganization, may continue to benefit from the withholding of income tax policy.
In order to ensure that profits earned by offshore investors are actually used for direct investment, the circular provides that the profits of offshore investors for direct investment are paid in cash, that the money in question is transferred directly from the account of the profit-allocation enterprise to the account of the invested enterprise or of the transferring equity, that it is not permitted to swing in other accounts, both within and outside the country, before the direct investment; that the profits of offshore investors for direct investment are paid in non-cash form, such as in kind, marketable securities, and that ownership of the assets in question is transferred directly from the profit-allocation enterprise to the investing enterprise or the transferring of equity, and that no other enterprise, individual, is permitted to hold or temporarily hold on behalf of the other enterprise or individual prior to the direct investment.
The circular also requires the tax authorities to strengthen their follow-up management in accordance with the law.
Expatriate investors who have been granted a policy of withholding advance income tax, and who fail to meet the prescribed conditions, as verified by the follow-up management of the tax administration, are deemed to have failed to file corporate income tax as required, in addition to being corporate liability for profit distribution, will be held liable under the law for a delay in the payment of taxes from the date of payment of the relevant profits.
Friday, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States stated that it would no longer allow the import of raw-material drugs produced by the Chinese China Sea Pharmacy industry and preparations made from the company ' s raw-material drugs.
A drug formerly produced by the China Sea Pharmacy industry was recalled for containing possible carcinogens.
The European Medical Authority (the European Medicines Agency) indicated that further action was under consideration with regard to the other components of the plant ' s production.
FDA states that major production process problems were identified during FDA ' s inspection of the pharmaceutical plant in the China Sea Pharmacy industry and that imports were subsequently stopped.
FDA also states that imports will be banned until the Chinese pharmaceutical industry discovers how these impurities are produced and improves its quality control system.
The Chinese pharmaceutical industry released a statement on the company's website on September 29, stating: “The company is making a positive and vigorous correction of the problems of this official inspection in the United States and Europe, and the company is very surprised and sorry for the way in which the official US and Europe dealt with it and for the results.
This is a concern of companies in the current complex market environment.
At present, the company is organizing teams, including professional lawyers, to communicate and file complaints in accordance with the relevant procedures and with United States and European Union officials, with a view to resuming production as soon as possible.”
Reuters September 29, Shanghai - CSRC announced on Friday evening that the CSRC had approved the initial application (IPO) of China People ' s Insurance Group, Inc., on that day, in accordance with the procedure established by law.
However, the CVM's official Twitter public did not disclose the scale of this IPO fund-raising campaign.

Ex-Foreign Aid charged with playing a false ball, North Control responding "No Need" - New Network in Central.
Yesterday afternoon, the Beijing Holding Football Club (hereinafter referred to as North), in an official response to the news that the former team of foreign aid workers, Anechbe, had accused the team of allegedly playing false football, issued a statement from the North Control that there was absolutely no such thing as playing false football on the part of the club, which was a complete fabrication made by Anichebe himself in the course of the arbitration, in order to cover up the fact that he was in flagrant violation of the contract, and for his personal and unjust economic purposes.
At the same time, the North Control stated that it would reserve the right to hold the parties to account by all means.
According to the Daily Post in the United Kingdom, Nigerian player Anechbe accused FIFA of being suspected of playing false football by the Beijing North control team, which he had been in force last year, including Beijing Deby in the 21st round of the 2017 season.
It was the critical stage of Beijing and the rush, and the game of North control ended with zero-two negatives on the Beijingers and first-ever on the Anechbi.
There was an official response from the Northern Control Club yesterday to the Nigerian player's claim.
The statement stated that, following an internal investigation prior to the club, there had been no pseudo-ball games in which the team had participated.
Anichebe joined Beijing North in June 2017, and in December of the same year, Anichebe refused to join the team for winter training without any justification and refused to do so despite numerous reminders from the club.
The dispute between the parties has now been referred to FIFA and arbitration is ongoing.
The statement also referred to the fact that the high-profile “false ball charge” was in fact a fabrication made by Anichebe in the course of the arbitration in order to cover up the fact that it was in flagrant violation of the contractual agreement and for his personal and unjust economic purposes.
Its sole purpose of defaming clubs and Chinese football is to obtain unjust economic benefits.
Clubs are more than acceptable to any organization or any individual who, for the sake of their economic interests and personal grievance, engages in unprovoked accusations, slanders, slanders, slanders and defamatory acts against the club.
The Northern Controls therefore indicated that they would reserve the right to hold the parties to account by all means.
The Bank for Agricultural Development of China will invest 20 billion yuan in support of the Jilin Autumn food acquisition.
Since September, crop harvests have continued to peak in various parts of Jilin province.
Journalists have learned from the Jilin provincial branch of the China Agricultural Development Bank that agricultural issuances are now sufficient to provide $20 billion in credit funds to ensure that the financing for food purchases in Jilin Autumn is sufficient.
This year, it is known that the food production situation in Jilin has been generally stable, with some food processing enterprises increasing demand in the food market as a result of the expansion of production capacity and the increase in the rate of start-up.
In order to ensure the availability of funds for food policy acquisition, agricultural issuances have been actively engaged in the Autumn Food Acquisitions Bank meetings through visits to various buyers, such as farmers, processing enterprises, trading enterprises, etc.
Currently, 5.2 billion yuan has been invested in agricultural distribution to support the acquisition of 1.58 billion pounds of autumn grain by various food buyers.
A total of 120 major food buyers have deployed nearly 300 acquisition sites in Jilin province to ensure “full coverage” of the main food-producing districts, without leaving the acquisition funds available as “blank points”.
According to the head of the farm issuer, in accordance with the progress of the acquisition and the demand for money from the enterprise, and in the event of a shortage of acquisition funds, the farm issue will apply for an additional $20 billion in credit funds to ensure that the funds are available in full and on time, to preserve the stability of the food market and to protect the interests of farmers.
Chinese journalists will be taken away by the police in the year of the British Conservative Party, and China asks for an apology.
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, the spokesman for the British Embassy answered the questions of a Chinese journalist who had been taken away by the police during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party on the first day.
He called on the Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party to cease its interference in the internal affairs of China, its involvement in Hong Kong and its organizers to apologize to Chinese journalists.
A journalist asked about a side event of the Human Rights Committee of the British Conservative Party on the issue of Hong Kong on 30 September during its annual meeting, in which the Hong Kong opposition was invited to speak.
During the meeting, a Chinese journalist was taken away by the police.
What's your comment, please?
In the 21 years since Hong Kong's return to its homeland, the practice of “one country, two systems” had achieved great success, and Hong Kong's development achievements were universally recognized.
Hong Kong is Hong Kong, China, and Hong Kong affairs are purely an internal matter of China.
The Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party used the party ' s annual meeting to organize a side event to raise awareness of the anti-China separatist forces, and China expressed its grave concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We firmly reject any interference by any organization in Hong Kong affairs in any way.
Any attempt or action to promote “Hong Kong's independence” is futile.
It was totally unacceptable, according to the speaker, that freedom of expression had always been the United Kingdom ' s hallmark, but that Chinese journalists, when asking questions at the side meeting to express their views, had been subjected to widespread obstruction and even physical aggression.
We demand that the Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party cease its interference in the internal affairs of China, cease its involvement in Hong Kong, and that the organizers of the Conference apologize to the Chinese journalists.
The fifth World Internet Congress will be held from 7 to 9 November in the town of Zhejiang, and the world's Internet is about to re-enter “U-City Time”.
As a global event for the Internet community, the World Internet Congress has received a high degree of attention and broad recognition in the global Internet arena.
Over the past five years, the World Internet Congress had set up a grand stage for the exchange of cutting-edge technologies on the Internet, and the wide application of technological results at the Congress had given new impetus to global economic development.
The results were published to bring together the world's Internet front-line technology.
In the area of the Internet, which are the most advanced and notable achievements of the world today?
The leading scientific and technological results released by the World Internet Congress can provide answers.
The third World Internet Congress released for the first time 15 leading scientific and technological outcomes.
The results demonstrated were dynamic, widely applied and radiation-driven, reflecting the latest and most important breakthroughs in science and technology in the area of the global Internet at that time, and the pace of development and future prospects in the area of web-based information.
The results of the Fourth World Conference on the Internet were even more spectacular in light quantum computers, 5Gs, artificial intelligence capable of calculating emotions, etc.
The Convening Committee of the General Assembly established a special Committee to recommend world Internet leading scientific and technological results, composed of 44 eminent experts from 10 countries, including China and the United States, to gather nearly 1,000 innovations in the field of the Internet from all over the world, resulting in the evaluation of 18 representative outcomes, including the “Word 3GP 5G pre-commercial system” “Arm security architecture” “Microsoft ice” “Beidou satellite navigation system” “significant applications based on the `The Light of the Lake' supercomputer system”.
Currently, the Beidou satellite navigation system applications cover more than 50 countries and territories, involving more than 3 billion people.
The Great Lakes Light supercomputer completed more than 2 million operations and supported more than 100 applications.
From China, the “Microsoft Ice,” pioneered by Microsoft China’s research and development team, is now in China, Japan, the United States, India, Indonesia, and many other players, such as television anchors, radio anchors, and singers. China’s Internet science and technology development is constantly flashing the world’s scientific and technological frontier, attracting the world’s surprises, and serving as a confluence of the world’s top technology and a sign of the wind.
A new platform for technology exchange at the Internet Light Expo
As one of the key elements of the World Internet Congress, the Internet Light Expo, which drives the interactive exchange of the results of global Internet science, technology and innovation, provides an important platform for Internet enterprises to demonstrate the latest results.

The development of Internet science and technology for the benefit of all peoples
The innovative development driven by Internet technology is ultimately to create a better future for the peoples of the world and a more equitable, open and inclusive environment for human well-being, economic development and social well-being.
In a large Internet country such as China, which has a large user base, Internet technology has a stronger amplification effect on specific applications.
In China, for example, Beidou provides high-precision, high-reliability positioning, speed measurement and timing services to users, combined with a unique short message communication capability; the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, which has a reshaping function for traditional industries, promotes industrial progress and plays a positive role in various areas, such as finance, transport, health, safety, etc.; and communications technology between the sky and the earth effectively solves the problem of access to air and high-iron vehicles, and improves users ' access to the Internet.
According to the forty-second Statistical Report on the Development of the Internet in China, published by the China Internet Information Centre, China, as the largest Internet market in the world, is promoting social development progress through a digital process.
The dividends of the technological development of the Internet are by no means limited to China, and its results provide a powerful driving force for the development of the Internet throughout the world, as well as for the development of the economy and society.
For example, China ' s cross-border power suppliers and shared economies have moved overseas, increasingly supporting world economic growth, and China ' s development of new generations of information technology, such as cloud computing, big data, material networking, mobile Internet, has accelerated the deepening of the global industrial division of labour and economic restructuring, reshaping the pattern of global economic competition.
As outlined in the Omega Initiative, launched by the Second World Internet Congress, the sharing of web-based development results, leading to the early formation of a global network market and the creation of more jobs, will provide a strong support for the sustained and healthy development of the global economy, with more countries and people on the fast track of the information age.

The Chinese State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Wang Yi, in a speech delivered on Friday in the United States Foreign Relations Committee, stated that, now that Chinese-American relations are once again at a crossroads, better prospects can be opened if both sides view each other positively, deepen positive cooperation and manage differences properly.
“Chinese-American relations are our common asset, and we need to be together.”
He expressed the hope that all sectors of the two countries would have the knowledge to take practical action to preserve the healthy and stable development of the relations between China and the United States and to jointly promote the continuation of the relations between China and the United States in the right direction.
Wang Ying also stressed once again that China must move out of a path of development that is different from that of the traditional Powers.
This Chinese-characteristic path determines that China will not and will not be in the same position as the powerful. It also determines that China will not become the United States, will not challenge the United States, and will not replace the United States.
In his speech entitled " Opportunities or Challenges, Partners or Counteractors " , Wang Yi said that the deep problem at hand was that some American friends believed that China would be strong and powerful and would even challenge and replace the United States as a leader in the world.
“This is clearly a major strategic miscalculation.”
He claimed, however, that this perceived suspicion was spreading, magnifying existing contradictions, creating new doubts, and making it more difficult and resistant to solving specific problems between China and the United States.
Wang Yi noted that China is following a path of peaceful development.
Chinese have never had the genes for external expansion.
We believe that nations can live together in harmony and mutual understanding.
In the past, the present and the future, China would neither replicate the foreign model nor ask others to replicate its practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with former United States Secretary of State Kissinger in New York, he said that US-China cooperation would win, and confrontation would lose both.
China has always been committed to the development of long-term healthy and stable relations between China and the United States, with a view to achieving non-conflict, non-confrontational, respectful and cooperative win-win relations.
China's new office held a press conference on Tuesday to present and interpret the White Paper on the Facts and Position of China and the United States of America on Economic and Trade Frictions.

On 30 September 2018, local time, in Palu, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, the rescuer carried a survivor of the earthquake who had been rescued from the ruins of the restaurant.
According to officials of the relief services, the tsunami caused waves as high as 6 metres, and the impact of the earthquake and tsunami was greater than originally estimated.
At the time of the earthquake and tsunami, hundreds of people were known to be celebrating festivals on the beaches of Palu, and many were killed by waves.
According to officials, the tsunami hit the shore at 800 kilometres an hour and many buildings and infrastructure were destroyed.
He said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed and that the tsunami-induced mudslides had cut off a major road in Palu.
A large bridge across coastal rivers collapsed in Sulawesi.
On 30 September, local time, President Zoko of Indonesia visited the city of Central Sulawesi Palu, where the earthquake occurred.
In a visit to the affected areas on 30 September, Indonesian President Zorko stated that he had sent troops to assist in the search and rescue and called for the patientness of the victims.
Zoko noted that rescue operations were difficult owing to the shortage of heavy machinery and personnel.
He was informed of the lack of food, water, food and fuel supplies in many of the affected areas, as well as the closure of a number of businesses after the earthquake and the dispatch of aircraft.
He called on the victims to be patient and to remain in their original positions for relief.
Search and rescue personnel in the city of Palou said they heard a call for help from a collapsed hotel in the city, but some of them needed to save people with their own hands, as no heavy machine was able to remove the rubble.
According to Vice-President Kara of Indonesia, electricity and communications were cut off in some areas, leading to information inaccessibility, and the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami could eventually rise to thousands.
On 5 November, the journalist in Shenyang, journalist Xu Zhiqiang, correspondent Ying Na, was informed today by the Liaoning Provincial Court, at a meeting on the basic resolution of enforcement difficulties, that the Liaoning Provincial Court, during its six-month “storm” campaign, severely combated non-compliance, transferred 241 persons for refusal to enforce the law, and maintained its high-handedness in the fight against denial of justice.
According to the unified deployment of the Liaoning High Court, from early April to the end of September, the Liaoning Court launched a semi-annual “storm” campaign for the basic resolution of the implementation difficulties, marshalling the dominant forces and launching a comprehensive general offensive on the basic resolution of the implementation difficulties.
At the same time, provincial courts have organized, in accordance with the law, “five groups” of fines, detention, restriction of consumption, breach of trust, transfer of persons to refuse to be convicted.
At the beginning of the campaign, there were more than 132,000 outstanding enforcement cases in provincial courts, and the case was cleared at the end of July.
A total of 12,607 thousand yuan was fined, 4146 persons were detained, 162,844 people were confined to consumption, 55,128 persons were misdeeds were punished, and 241 persons were transferred for denial of justice.
Between January and October of this year, the Liaoning Court handled a total of 297438 enforcement cases, an increase of 13.28 per cent over the same year; 2,26558 cases, an increase of 83.18 per cent over the same year; and 31.236 billion yuan in implementation, an increase of 74.94 per cent over the same year.
“Where can I take a taxi?
We want to go to Golden Purple Square to watch the flag-raising ceremony of the Fourth of July!"
On the morning of 1 October, Mr. and Mrs. Song, who took a flight from Ningxia to Shenzhen, and moved to Shenzhen on the first train on the high-speed railway train in Hong Kong, went to Hong Kong to receive a visit from a Chinese news agency reporter at Kowloon West Station, Hong Kong.
On the morning of 1 October, in celebration of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region held a ceremony to raise the flag of the People ' s Republic of China.
According to immigration control station statistics, as of 30 September, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via the Kowloon West Station in Gao Iron had exceeded 300,000.
On the occasion of the 69th anniversary of the birth of the motherland, the West Kowloon Border Post is expected to see a peak in tourist arrivals on 1 and 2 October.
At 7 a.m. a.m., the press arrived in Hong Kong, and many Mainland passengers took advantage of the Golden Week on the occasion of the National Day and took a trip to Hong Kong.
Mrs. Song, who took a short step, said to the press that the holiday of the National Day was a rare and long holiday of the year, and that she was particularly pleased and excited to be able to achieve it on the occasion of the National Day, as she had always wanted to see the flag raised in Golden Purple Square in Hong Kong.
However, Ningxia's flight to and from Hong Kong was not easy, as it was in high iron Hong Kong, and Mr. Song, after checking the train schedule, found that the first bus would arrive at 7.03 a.m., and that the city's transportation to Golden Purple Square was just in time.
He lamented with the press: "It's so convenient, it's fast, it's on time!"
The daily 70-hour short-haul train to and from Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shenzhen North and Fukuda and West Kowloon greatly facilitated the arrival of residents of the Austa Bay region in Hong Kong.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, arrived in Hong Kong and is on his way to Hong Kong's friends to meet at the top of the Central Ribbon.
Mr. Liu said, “The Mainland and Hong Kong are on holiday on the Fourth of July, and we're going to challenge ourselves to see if we can make the 50-km Hong Kong route!”
He explained that they would not have been able to attempt such a long range of mountain movements without the opening of the high iron, the ease of movement and the availability of sufficient time.
Mrs. Yang, from Dong-jung, came to Hong Kong with her 10-year-old son on a pianist race, and was proud to tell journalists that his son had spent three years on the National Day in this way.
She's been on a bus in Hong Kong before, but she's time-consuming, and she's worried about affecting her son's condition. She's been in Shenzhen this time on a high train, with ease of clearance, half her time, and the Hong Kong section of her journey is even more impressive. She says to reporters: “It's as if she's on a subway, especially fast, and I've never been able to take a photo before!”
On 23 September, at 6.44 p.m., the G5711 “Harm” high-rail train left from Shenzhen North Station for a lull and, a few minutes later, entered the Hong Kong section of the Hong Kong high-speed train, the first such train to be officially operated in Hong Kong.
The high-iron Hong Kong section, which is integrated into the country ' s 25,000-km high-iron network and extends to 38 long-distance stations throughout the country, also welcomes inland travellers from different provinces in the north-south of the country.
Mr. Gao, who came from Changsha to visit his family in Hong Kong on a short vacation, told the press that he was happy when he came home to eat his children's lunch.
He said that the “two-by-one” customs clearance process was exceedingly convenient, “in less than 10 minutes, both have passed.”
The West Kowloon station, which is close to the airport express, connecting land and air traffic, has also become the preferred location for a large number of transit passengers.
Ms. Wu, from Fujian, is going to spend the Golden Week with her friends from Hong Kong to the Philippines, pushing her luggage out of the gate at the West Kowloon, saying to reporters, “I didn't expect to catch the plane so soon.
According to the TTA subsidiary arrangements announced on Monday, the new US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain the ability of US President Trump to implement the 25 per cent tariff threat on imported cars, while at the same time providing for a general exemption from customs duties on passenger vehicles, pickups and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexico.
If Trump imposed so-called “Chapter 232” tariffs on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Canada would have a vehicle quota of 2.6 million tax-exempt vehicles per year exported to the United States.
Piccards produced in both countries will be completely exempted from customs duties under subsidiary arrangements.
If the Trumpuga tariff were imposed, Mexico would receive an exemption from the tax quota of $108 billion per year for vehicle spare parts, and Canada would receive a quota of $32.4 billion.
Both quotas are well above the current levels of production in both countries and provide room for growth in exports from both countries.
According to Reuters/Mexico, 28 September - Friday, Mexico, after several days of controversy, the Government of United States President Trump and Canada are making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences, giving the hope that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will be maintained in the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite the lack of detail, the above evident progress is sufficient to prompt the Governments of Mexico and the United States to abruptly suspend their plans to publish the text of the trade agreement between the two sides and to give Canada more time to accede to the agreement.
Mexico's President-designate, Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, told journalists in Mexico that the United States Government had made new counter-proposals to the Government of Canada and that he would continue to press for the participation of all three countries in NAFTA.
The Minister of Economy of Mexico, Ildefonso Guajardo, stated that the submission of the text of the inter-American and ink trade agreement to Mexican and United States legislation had been delayed because of “very serious” attempts by the Governments of Canada and the United States to reach an agreement.
Guaharto says, “In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of a tripartite agreement or whether we have to publish the text of the two-party agreement.”
Guahardo stated that his United States and Canadian counterparts had “specially requested” that the text be postponed.
The spokesperson for the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the US-Medical Trade Agreement and the consultations between the United States and Canada.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to requests for comments on counter-proposals.
According to the foreign media, in a care centre on the outskirts of Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, two small lions play together, and it is difficult to see any anomalies, but they are nothing else.
The University of Pretoria declared: “This is the first young lion ever born by artificial insemination - the first pair of lions in the world.”
School scientists are working on the reproductive system of the female African lion.
The Director of the Mammal Institute of the University of Pretoria, Gans Winter, stated that the two young lions, one male and one female, born on 25 August, were healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally reached this breakthrough.
When Ganswinter was interviewed by the media, he said: “We collect sperm from a healthy lion.”
The researchers then perform artificial insemination of the female when the hormone content reaches an appropriate level.
Ganswinter said: “Lucky, the result was a success.”
He said that the researchers “had several attempts, but unexpectedly, not much effort”.
He said that the above-mentioned research breakthroughs could be replicated and that scientists wanted to use the technology to save endangered large cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, lions are extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of surviving wild lions has fallen by 43 per cent in the last 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
The African lion is classified by this organization as a vulnerable animal.
Gans Winter said, "If we don't do something for these animals, they'll be extinct."
He stated that the new technology did not have to allow lions to be raised, but simply injected sperm into a pregnant female lion, as had been done in North America and Europe with regard to the breeding of elephants.
South Korea ' s exports declined the most in September in the past two years, but analysts attributed the decline to fewer working days and stated that global demand for Korean commodities remained strong despite rising trade tensions in the United States and Central America.
Indeed, the average daily exports of the Republic of Korea increased last month.
In addition, earlier published opening data showed double-digit growth in exports in the first weeks of September prior to extended leave.
Korea ' s exports in September fell by the largest on a year-on-year basis since July 2016, a decline greater than the 5.7 per cent projected by 11 Reuters analysts.
The opening values released on Monday showed exports of $50.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
Despite fears that a growing trade dispute between the United States and China could cause other export-dependent China’s neighbours to suffer, South Korea’s exports to China grew by 7.8 per cent in September, expanding for the first 23 months in a row.
South Korea’s exports to the United States declined by 11.8 per cent, owing to a decline in sales of petroleum products.
The overseas sales of Korean memory chips and petroleum products grew by 28.3 per cent and 13.5 per cent, respectively, despite market concerns that the so-called “supercycle” of chips may have peaked.
“The effects of the trade conflict will, however, be difficult to avoid, as Korean exports depend heavily on the markets of the United States and China.”
Imports declined by between 2.1 per cent and $40.8 billion, compared with the 3.1 per cent increase projected by the Reuters Survey.
The trade surplus in September began with $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
According to the Ministry of Industry, thanks to the United States and the European Union, the global manufacturing industry will remain buoyant, which is a favourable factor for Korean exports.
The statement states that “Increased export prices as a result of rising oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year.”
“However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with increased market volatility following the rise in interest rates in the United States, are all negative pressures on exports.”
Exports increased from an average of $2.6 billion per working day in September to $2.1 billion in August.
Korea's mid-autumn season fell from 24 to 26 September this year, resulting in 19.5 working days in September, four days less than in the same period last year.
Korea ' s exports grew 4.7 per cent in January-September compared to the same period last year.
According to the Japanese menstruation/Market purchasing manager index, manufacturing activity in Korea rebounded in September, but was supported by domestic orders, as orders from China and Japan fell, threatening to cast a shadow over export prospects.
North Korean media criticized the US for not relaxing the sanctions on the DPRK.
The DPRK's Labour News published an op-ed article in the 30 September Journal criticizing the United States for seeking dialogue with the DPRK while not relaxing the sanctions against the DPRK as a “compromise”.
According to the article, United States Secretary of State Pompeyo 14 stated that “the key to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the implementation of the sanctions against the DPRK” and stressed that the United States position remains unchanged with regard to its continued implementation of United Nations sanctions resolutions.
In the Singapore-United States joint statement, the two sides committed themselves to a new inter-Korean-American relationship that is commensurate with the aspirations of the two peoples of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea and the United States to peace and prosperity.
There is no doubt that it is contradictory for the United States to increase the pressure on sanctions and to call for dialogue.
The article says that if new relations between the DPRK and the United States are to be established, a peaceful regime permanently consolidated on the Korean peninsula is to be built, and a complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is to be achieved, confidence-building should be at the forefront, starting with what can be done, with a phased solution, one by one.
The article also stated that the United States should understand that the sanctions would not work for the DPRK.
The article says that even the "North Devinsk" before the "Kasan" is a compliment to the American army.
The National Interest magazine quotes the American Navy: “We will meet a powerful potential opponent. Just look at the North Devinsk submarine.”
The current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, Fogo, also praised the "North Devinsk" submarine.
He said, “This submarine is impressive. Look at the development of the Russian navy, how its resources are used, and see that its main effort in research and development is, first and foremost, to strengthen the submarine fleet.”
However, the National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this area.
Forgo said, “I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantages.”
Previously, there had been reports that the Russian Navy would be loading the Kazan submarine in 2019.
The Kazan, Nueva Siberia, Krasnoyarsk, and Arhangarsk multi-purpose submarines are “white wax tree-M” modified with 13,800 tons of drainage, deep depth 520 metres, man 64, underwater speed 31 knots, and will carry torpedo, torpedo, and “calibre” and “gauge” cruise missiles.
On 29 September, the General Directorate of Radio, Radio and Television, the news agency of New Kyoto (journalist Nin Wei), issued a circular on the introduction of a special radio and television advertising campaign, which has been under way since that date until the end of the year.
The reform consists of advertisements with low content, style and taste, and medical feeding programmes that are broadcast without a record management.
According to the circular, the focus of this special treatment is on nine areas.
These include: advertisements with directional problems; advertisements with poor content, tone and taste; advertisements with excessive time and non-standard broadcasting problems; advertisements with exaggerated false propaganda, misleading audiences, or advertising with distorted programming, such as medical, pharmaceutical, medical devices, health-care food, cosmetics, beauty, etc., which are broadcast without record management; medical feeding programmes with exaggerated false propaganda, misleading audiences, inducements to the audience to be associated with defrauded issues, investment finance, collectors, etc., which are expected to yield returns on investment; advertisements with incentives to create undesirable behaviour or to create undesirable values that harm the physical and mental health of minors; advertisements with long-term, frequent and non-required requirements for public service announcements; advertising systems that are inadequate, which examine irregularities and responsibilities; and advertisements with other irregularities.
This process will be carried out throughout the country, with a view to ensuring that the requirements of regulation and regulation are fully implemented at all levels of the mass media, frequency of channels, programme columns and time slots, “no blind areas, no dead spots, no exceptions”.
The circular requires that the various types of unlawful advertising found in the supervision and inspection be dealt with by the authorities at all levels of the general electricity and electricity administration, in strict accordance with the General Directorate ' s Code on the Treatment of Infringements by Radio and Television Broadcasters.
In the case of serious violations, reprimands, notification of criticism, suspension of the broadcast of advertisements until the suspension of the broadcast of the frequency channel, etc., are taken seriously and, where appropriate, brought to the public's attention.
In recent years, the General Directorate of Electricity and Electricity has repeatedly called for the closure of illegal advertisements.
This year, the Directorate-General of National Radio and Television issued a circular publicly calling for the closure of advertisements for serious irregularities such as “0 bubbles of fruit milk”, “Sava cocktails” and “Bonret plant prophylactic exaggeration” and exaggeration, and misleading audiences.
The General Directorate of Radio and Telecommunications has developed a number of regulations and circulars to regulate advertising on radio and television.
The Circular on the Further Enhancement of the Administration of the Broadcasting of Short Video Video Video Discreet Advertisements stipulates that the Vigils are not permitted to broadcast short television commercials from 1800 to 2400 hours a day.
Advertisements of television shopping spots are broadcast at other times without the use of moderators for propaganda, “sale-style” exaggerations, tone, movement, etc., or “orthopaedics”, “plastics”, “peath-fats”, “fat-rolling” or disguised advertising of breast-rich and dietary products, with no more than one (twice) per hour per day and no more than three minutes per day of television shopping spots.
The Circular on Further Strengthening the Management of Broadcasting of Radio and Television Advertising stipulates that television stations must strictly comply with the General Directorate ' s Order No. 61 when advertising in the middle of a film and television drama: two commercial advertisements may be inserted in each episode of non-gold time (45 minutes) for a period of not more than 1 minute and 30 seconds each time; one commercial in each concentration of gold time (1900 to 2100 hours) for a period of not more than 1 minute; the advertisement shall be advertised for a period of not more than 1 minute.
The circular also stipulates that radio and television broadcasters shall strictly examine the qualifications, certifications, etc. of health information advertisements, such as medical, pharmaceutical, medical devices, health food, etc., and firmly prohibit the broadcasting of sex-related advertisements.
In order to regulate the advertising of health information, it is not possible to advertise in a different form as a health information feature.
Health information features should focus on scientific knowledge, such as disease prevention, control and treatment, and must not contain advertising, such as medical, pharmaceutical, medical devices, health-care foods, or evidence on behalf of patients and doctors, pharmacists, specialists, etc.
Mantourov said, “We have adjusted the format of the MAKS International aerospace salon for the first time. We suggest China as a host country. China’s peers agreed and accepted our invitation.”
Not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the fourth Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of Russian President Putin.
This was his first time at the Forum.
Disregard the American threat!
EU or a crude oil procurement agreement with Iran
The United States Government recently announced that a new round of sanctions against Iran would resume in November and even urged other countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil.
However, the allies of the United States do not seem to listen.
According to the United States New York Times, on 29 September, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed during his visit that, despite the United States threat to impose sanctions on any country doing business with Iran, Tehran was approaching an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil.
The central purpose of the agreement was to attempt to create a new payment mechanism, i.e. to replace United States dollar transactions by barter or currency denominated.
The aim of this approach is to hope to bypass the United States and to prevent the United States from blocking financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is committed to the promotion of the agreement, a number of French and British officials are concerned that, if the agreement were to materialize, it would be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States, which opposes the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement.
According to the media, Zarif's words sound more optimistic in an hour's interview than in recent months.
Because of its ability to “severe” the traditional allies of the United States, the agreement effectively breaks down the attempts of the United States to cut Iranian revenues.
“This ensures that we sell oil and benefit from it,” Zarif argues, according to the agreement reached in 2015, that countries have a legitimate right to trade with Iran.
The European Union’s foreign policy head, Federica Mogherini, also said before, “No sovereign state or organization can accept anyone else to decide who it can trade with.”
However, she also predicted that, before the next sanctions were imposed by the United States Government in November, United States leaders might resort to a range of financial instruments designed to target banks, businessmen and countries with which they had business dealings in Tehran.
In May this year, the United States Government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed and stated that the agreement could not permanently prohibit the production of nuclear fuel by Iran.
The United States subsequently threatened to prohibit companies buying Iranian oil and other commodities from operating in the United States.
This threat led to the withdrawal of some companies from Tehran and the collapse of the Iranian currency.
Companies such as Airbus and the French oil giant Dadal have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have stated that the United States Government may “take the upper hand”.
If not, according to a recent Turkish media report, the United States sanctions do not seem to have had a significant impact on Iran's oil exports.
The Iranian oil minister, Xanqane, had recently revealed that no country other than the Republic of Korea had stopped purchasing Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani believe that a series of acts by the United States was aimed at “during” Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also concerned about a series of verbal attacks on the American side, and when asked whether the US would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing fiscal pressure, Zarif even laughed, “It is a strategy of regime change, and that is the real purpose of the US.”
The launch of the Cultural Tourism Market of the Xiamen Hurley Battery.
In that year, the first broadcaster to broadcast Mandarin on Fujian front radio station, Chen Fai, came to the gun station to remember and tell the history of the gun.
The well-known tourist attraction area, the Xiamen Huri Artillery Battery Zone, which is separate from the Golden Gate, was once the home of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's “front-line radio station”.
On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the opening of the Front Line Radio station, on 30th of the day, the scenery organized a “Swat Battery Memorial” event, in which several historical witnesses from the Front Line were invited to speak about the historical evolution of the cannon station and to witness the development of cross-Strait relations.
The history of the cannons was described by witnesses to the history of the frontline radio station in that year.
This is one of the activities of the second “Market of Cultural Tourism of the Xiamen Huri Artillery” edifice, which was built to the full.
Prior to this, the first event was successfully organized to create an exclusive cultural tourism brand with a cultural tourism IP, a creative market and a traditional folk culture experience.
On the same day, under the direction of the Xiamen City Brigade Development Committee, the second edition of the “Ancient Artillery and New Era” cultural tourism fair, hosted by the Xiamen Hurley Artillery Zone, officially opened with a six-day event, under the main theme of the Mid-Autumn and the National Days “Celebration of Joy”, where the people who came to the tour had a multidimensional experience of the cynicism of the “Eat” and the “Buy” of the “Buy”.
The “Hearing the Voice of the Sea” concert has become a major feature of the Artillery Cultural Tourism Fair.
Wang Yong, Director of the Huri Artillery Artillery Authority, described the event of the “Mount Reaper” in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the launch of the front radio station of the Huri Artillery Artillery of the Liberation Army, in which several old radio broadcasters were invited to tell about the history of the cannon and to remind people of the past.
In addition to this, the series of events at the Tourism Fair includes the reform of the 40th Anniversary concert, the old photo screening, and the Grand Monument of Mono Art Devices on both sides of the Straits of 2018.
Among other things, the “Hearing the Voice of the Sea” concert, a major feature of the Gun Platform Cultural Tourism Fair, was the exclusive cultural branding of the landscape, which invited the Xiaomen City Young City's Phoenix Girls' Choir to contribute to the concert of the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening of the ancient cannons in the Ishan Sea, showing the convergence of the ancient cannons with the New Age.
A large public service exhibition of single-body artistic devices on both sides of the bank, which took place during the National Day in the Battery Zone, focused on creating a “eye effect” that attracted a large number of tourists, citizens to visit the scene, a photo, a circle of friends, a twilight shot, and allowed the city of Xiamen to add a “net red” factor.
And Xiamen 40 years, you and I — the old photo selection, the award-winning exhibition in the landscape, through a temperature picture, digs deep into those moments of happiness and movement.
The Regulations for the Promotion of Ecocivilization in Fujian province were adopted by a vote of the thirteenth session of the Standing Committee of the Fujian People ' s Party on 30 September, on electricity (journalist Longmin).
The “Green Water Mountain is Silver Mountain” was first enshrined in Fujian provincial legislation, throughout the entire regulation, as an operational and enforceable provision.
Fujian is the first national eco-civilization test site in China.
According to the Head of the Rule of Law Office of the Fujian People ' s Government, it is necessary and urgent to develop a basic regulatory framework for the construction of ecological civilization, from a holistic and holistic perspective, in order to address the problem of decentralized regulations and regulations, policy documents regulating the construction of ecological civilization, and also to provide the legal basis for the adoption of regulations, normative documents and measures.
The Ordinance fully reflects the ethos of Fujian, and translates the mature practice of building ecological civilization into a statutory form, such as the replicable and replicable “Janting experience” of the management of Fujian soil and water conservation, and provides that local people's governments at and above the county level shall strengthen their unified leadership of soil and water conservation, and designate water and soil erosion prevention and governance areas as a priority, based on the results of the study of soil erosion; and also, as in the case of the river length system in Fujian province, the regulations raise the river length, lake length, to the legislative level, and require local people's governments at all levels to fully implement the river and lake length systems and implement the river basins, responsibilities and funding, among other things.
The regulation provides for the introduction of a life-long liability system for damage to the ecological environment.
Those who violate the requirements of scientific development and cause serious damage to ecological and environmental resources are held accountable for life to the principal leaders and those responsible for their leadership responsibilities.
On 1 November of this year, it was reported that the Ordinance on the Promotion of the Construction of Ecocivilization in Fujian Province will enter into force.

In order to further encourage offshore investors to invest in China, a joint circular of four ministries, including the Chinese Ministry of Finance, states that, with effect from 1 January 2018, profits allocated to offshore investors from residential enterprises in China have been used to suspend the application of the policy of pre-taxation for domestic direct investment, with projects in the foreign investment incentive category being expanded to cover all projects and areas where foreign investment is not prohibited.
The Ministry of Finance ' s website contains relevant circulars stating that foreign investors are subject to several conditions at the same time, including direct investment by offshore investors with a profit share, including equity investment by offshore investors with a profit share, new construction, equity acquisition, etc., but excluding the addition, conversion, acquisition of shares in listed companies (except eligible strategic investments).

Moreover, profits from direct investment by offshore investors are paid in cash, and the money is transferred directly from the account of the profit distribution enterprise to the account of the investor's enterprise or equity transferer, and may not run in other accounts within or outside the country before the direct investment; profits from direct investment by offshore investors are paid in the form of non-cash, such as in kind, marketable securities, and ownership of the assets is transferred directly from the profit distribution enterprise to the investor's business or equity transferor, and may not be held on behalf of other enterprises or individuals prior to the direct investment.
The circular also states that offshore investors actually recover direct investment that is subject to the policy of withholding income tax treatment through equity transfers, repurchases, liquidation, etc., and file with the tax authorities, in accordance with the prescribed procedure, a refund of deferred tax within seven days of the actual collection of the corresponding payment.
In an effort to encourage foreign investors to continue their investment operations in China, four ministries, including the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce of China, issued a joint circular at the end of 2017, whereby, as of 1 January 2017, profits distributed by foreign investors from residential enterprises in China were invested directly in investment-incentive investment projects, and where the conditions were met, a deferred tax policy was introduced, with no pending income tax.
At the Standing Meeting of the State Council of China, weekly decisions were taken to extend the scope of application of the moratorium on foreign reinvestment in income tax from encouraging foreign-type projects to all non-prohibited projects and areas, and to further strengthen intellectual property protection.
Journalists have learned from the National Commission on Health and Hygiene that, compared to decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in the country has declined, while the incidence of overweight obesity has increased significantly.
In this regard, experts pointed out that the most important concept of maintaining healthy weight is “repair from disease”, with a strong promotion of scientific fitness and reasonable diet.
According to the Chinese Youth Health Education Core Information and Interpretations (2018 edition), published recently by the National Health Commission, the key to maintaining healthy weight is rational diet and scientific movement.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight reduction are detrimental to health.
The health risks behind the “bubby pup” cannot be ignored.
The Director-General of the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Ding Jian Jian Jian, stated that overweight obesity is a danger to the normal growth and development of young people, with adverse psychological, behavioural, cognitive and intellectual effects, even leading to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood resin among children.
At the same time, overweight obesity among adolescents can easily continue into adulthood, increasing the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes among adolescents as adults.
According to Jing Jing, the nutritional and health status of China ' s residents from 2010 to 2012 showed an overweight rate of 9.6 per cent for children aged 6-17 and 6.4 per cent for obesity, which together stands at 16 per cent.
At the same time, overweight obesity among children and adolescents is characterized by higher levels of male than female and urban than rural, and the overweight obesity rate has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do adolescents cope with overweight obesity?
According to Zhang, Deputy Director of the Centre for Scientific Physics and Health Promotion of the National Directorate of Sports, the main causes of obesity among young people are excessive heat intake and inadequate physical activity.
For this simple obesity, the emphasis should be on scientific sport plus rational dietary control.
According to Zhang, the most important concept of maintaining healthy body weight is that of “the cure of the disease”, which is important as part of the comprehensive general education of schools, parents and students, the spread of the dangers of overweight and obesity, and the promotion of prevention among adolescents.
Adolescents should undergo regular medical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators, such as body weight, early detection, scientific diagnosis of overweight and obesity, in order to allow for timely intervention.
For young people who are already overweight, Ting Qiang recommends that, in addition to the active scientific organization of meals and sports, adolescents are in a special physiological stage and that they avoid the use of hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce their weight, and that they not blindly take diet drugs.
Reuters September 28 - Friday, Facebook (FB.O) stated that hackers stole digital landing codes, giving them access to nearly 50 million user accounts, the most important security gap in their history, without precedent.
More than 2.2 billion monthly Facebook users stated that it had not yet been determined whether the attackers abused any accounts or stole personal information.
The company also did not find the location of the hackers, nor was it certain that the hackers targeted specific victims.
Its preliminary analysis revealed that it was a wide-ranging attack.
Executive Director Zuckerberg called the incident “really serious” at a media conference.
A spokesperson for the company stated that his account number, as well as the account number of the operator, Sheryl Sandberg, had also been affected.
Facebook stock prices fell by 2.6 % on Friday, dragging Wall Street's main share finger.
U.S. Member of Parliament said on Friday that the attack was likely to increase external calls for data privacy legislation.
“This is yet another sad evidence of the need for Congress to act to protect the privacy and security of social media users,” said Democratic Senator Mark Warner in a statement.
Rohit Chopra, a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), on Twitter, said that I wanted an answer to Reuters's report on this security gap.
On September 30, China's Fifth Martyrs' Day was marked by the new China Net leader, Sha, on the 30th of September (JUN Qing Xiang Xian).
On such a special day, members of society, such as the families of the war veterans, the representatives of the DR and the Hunan Veterans' House, came to Changsha City, the “Tang Man's Day Garden, the theme park for the fight against the war”, to attend a mass burial ceremony in 2018 to commemorate the memory of the Japanese war veterans, and to send 10 other war veterans and four other war veterans' partners.
“The veterans of the resistance are witnesses to the Chinese resistance, a true, vivid and stark teaching of patriotism.”
Liu Xiao, former Vice-President of the Political Consultative Council of Hunan Province, said that the courage and fear of the veterans of the war, who had forgotten my patriotism, was a valuable spiritual asset to the present generation.
In his address, the Vice-President of the Changsha Municipal Association and Chu Jianjun, the Main Committee of the Chang Sha City Council, noted that in recent years, the Care for War Veterans project, which provided care services to war veterans in the form of living allowances, free old-age pensions and free burials, had become an excellent brand in the work of the Changsha civil Ge social services.
In his view, the spirit of resistance can be carried forward only if history is engraved in its heart.
At 11 a.m., in a solemn and heavy sound of music, the people who came to the event stood up.
The members of the Chinese troupe were dressed in tuxedos, with flowers, with fine paces, to send 10 other war veterans and 4 other war veterans as companions.
The participants in the event paid tribute to the veterans of the war and to the many children in the crowd who, along with their parents, paid tribute to the heroes of the war.
The “Tang Man's Mankind Gardens: The theme park for the fight against war” was established in 2014 as the country's first mausoleum on the theme of war resistance, created by the Changsha City Council in conjunction with Hunan China People's Mankind Gardens Limited.
The first phase of the mausoleum, which covers more than 2,000 square metres of land, consists of components such as the Hero ' s Indeterminate Monument, Victory Square, and the War Resister ' s Garden.
The War Heroes Garden, which provides for the tombs behind the war heroes, free of charge, was praised as the “last army camp of the war veterans”.
Each year, at the end of the anniversary, the mausoleum is marked by a large public sacrifice and burial ceremony.
Since 2015, there have been seven collective funeral ceremonies for war veterans, in which 102 war veterans and their companions have fallen asleep.
On 1 October, the newly revised Protocol for the Movement Control of the Three Gorges-Gega Dam Water Hub (hereinafter referred to as " the Movement Control Protocol " ) was officially implemented, with the three gorge lifts formally integrated with the gate two years after the pilot.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, the three gorges-George Dam waters operated in good order.
On 30 September, at 2100 hours, the Yangtze Three Gorge Shipping Authority issued its first security plan and carried out screening of 160 vessels, bringing the total number of vessels to 124.
On 1 October, at 1400 hours, the navigational services arranged the first post-implementation pass plan of the new regulations.
Following the implementation of the new regulations, the security plan is issued once a day at 9 p.m. and at 21 p.m., and the dam plan is issued once a day at 14 p.m. and at 20 p.m., allowing ships the flexibility to arrange the dam plan.
The Movement Control Protocol added the “classified control” principle for the movement of ships through dams, with clear priorities for the movement of ships through dams, based on the positioning of locks and lifter functions, and the adjustment of short-line passenger ships through locks to the same level of priority as model and good-faith vessels.
This is also the formal harmonization of movement with the gate two weeks after the launch of the lift.
For the first time, the river and the tri-fon reservoir areas have also been given priority in large-scale and wide-scale demonstration boats and new energy-powered ships.
At the same time, the Movement Control Directive adjusted the “flight-controlled waters” from the previous 180-km peri-dam water to 541.8 km from the Yunyang River Bridge to the Ishi River Bridge, and divided the “core waters, dam waters, controlled waters, controlled waters”.
This would facilitate the selection of suitable waters to be set aside and reduce the backlog of ships in dam areas.
The Movement Control Order also introduces integrity restrictions, such as the cancellation of a declaration of a vessel in violation of the regulations and the 24-hour delay in crossing a dam, based on the existing ship ' s dykes, the features of the stoppages.
As a result of water harvesting in the tri-gorge, the conditions of navigation in the reservoir area have improved, contributing to the rapid development of navigation in the Yangtze.
According to the data, the annual cargo throughput of the three gorges and the Gorge dam has increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons in 2017 and 140 million tons in 2017, respectively.
For the past two years, the Tri-Gorder has been on board 5767 ships, with 16.22 million passengers and a cargo volume of 1.7128 million tons.
Chen Dongwon, Deputy Director of the Three Gorges Navigation Authority, stated that the Movement Control Directive had a positive effect on promoting integrity through the gates, maintaining traffic order in the two dam hubs, defusing pressure from vessels in the dam area and increasing navigation capacity.

With the approval of Prime Minister Li Keqiang, the State Council recently issued the Decision on the Regulation of the List of Licences for the Production of Industrial Products for Further Depression and Simplified Approval Procedures.
The Decision proposes to further depress the catalogue of licences for industrial production, to eliminate the licensing of 14 categories of industrial products, and to delegate the authority for the licensing of 4 categories of industrial products to the Quality Technical Supervision Department of the People ' s Government at the provincial level.
As a result of this reform, products subject to industrial production licensing will be reduced from last year's 38-type pressure to the current 24-category.
The Decision makes it clear that simplified approval procedures are applied to products in the catalogue.
The first is to change the pre-licensing product test from the pre-licensing product test of the licensing agency to a product-testing qualification report issued by a qualified inspection body submitted by the enterprise at the time of application.
Second, in addition to hazardous chemicals, a back-to-place inspection of licensed products is carried out by the Quality Technical Supervision Department of the Provincial People ' s Government (Multimarket Supervisory Authority) and a formal review of the quality of the product is carried out, after which an enterprise submits an application and a product-testing conformity report with a commitment to ensure the quality of the product, before it is subject to an on-site review within a specified period of time.
Third, when an enterprise produces different categories of products in its catalogue, a licence is reviewed and issued in accordance with the “one-size-fits-all” principle, when a new licence is applied for or when a new licence is applied for.
The Decision requires that the regions and relevant departments firmly advance the work on the depressive catalogue and the simplification of the approval process.
Increased disclosure of business commitments and follow-up of on-site reviews, enhanced credit monitoring and restraint, enforcement of corporate quality subject responsibility, and the revocation of production licences for false promises and non-compliance with requirements.
For products that are subject to the removal of industrial production licences, there is a need for effective ex post regulation, involving products such as public health and safety, environmental protection, etc., which can be converted to mandatory certification, positive lists and social publicity, uniform certification standards, reasonable reduction and certification of testing projects, with mandatory certification costs being, in principle, institutionally borne by all levels of finance.
Support measures to encourage voluntary certification by enterprises and to promote branding and market expansion.
The upgrading of the quality of industrial products should be promoted through the adoption of advanced international standards for the subject matter.
Make full use of the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality safety of industrial products.
For products that are subject to the maintenance of industrial production licences, the standard system should be improved, industry regulatory advantages should be exercised, responsibility for “who approves and who supervises” should be strengthened, product quality safety risks should be assessed dynamically, catalogues should be reduced at the appropriate time, approval authority should be delegated or converted to certification management.
In September, China's combined PMI ring raised the manufacturing PMI ring back down.
According to data released by the National Statistical Office of China on 30 September, China ' s combined PMI output index was 54.1 per cent in September, higher than the previous month ' s and annual averages of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that the production and operation of Chinese enterprises remained generally stable.
The manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which made up the composite PMI output index, were 53.0 per cent and 54.9 per cent, respectively, in that month, a one-litre drop.
Of this, China’s manufacturing PMI is 50.8 %, and the ring is 0.5 percentage points down.
According to Zhao Qinghe, the manufacturing industry PMI was characterized in five ways this month:
The first is the overall stability of the manufacturing infrastructure.
Of the 21 industries surveyed, 14 are located in expansionary zones, with manufacturing PMIs, such as pharmaceuticals, specialized equipment, electrical machinery, all at higher operating levels than 53.5 per cent, increasing faster.
The second is the small volatility of supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0 per cent and 52.0 per cent, respectively, a decline of 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, with supply and demand maintaining the climate, but the expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and the import index were 48.0 per cent and 48.5 per cent, respectively, below the previous month ' s 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points, and the climate was at its lowest point in the year.
The fourth is the increased cost of purchasing raw materials from enterprises.
The main raw material acquisition price index was 59.8 per cent, an increase of 1.1 percentage points over the previous month, and the exit price index was 54.3 per cent, which was the same as the previous month, all of which was higher during the year.
The fifth is the robust operation of large enterprises and the continued improvement of small-scale enterprise operations.
The large-scale enterprise PMI is 52.1 per cent, the same as last month, and since this year, the index has remained at an expansion rate of 52.0 per cent or more, and the production index and the new order index ring ratio have increased this month, which is the main driving force behind the expansion of the manufacturing sector; the medium-sized enterprise PMI is 48.7 per cent, down from 1.7 percentage points in the previous month, and is located in a contraction zone; and the small-scale enterprise PMI is 50.4 per cent, up from 0.4 percentage points in the previous month, up from two consecutive months.
In that month, China ' s non-manufacturing business activity index was 54.9 per cent, an increase of 0.7 percentage points over the previous month and a two-month recovery.
According to Zhao Qinghe, the overall development of non-manufacturing industries continues to be steady and positive.
The index of business activity in sectors such as road transport, securities, real estate, etc., continues to be below the critical point, with a reduction in the total volume of business.
Reuters Nagoya, 5 November, the Governor of the Central Bank of Japan, Hirata Dong-hyun, stated that the Central Bank was aware that the long-term implementation of ultra-compressive monetary policy could crush the profitability of financial institutions and could destabilize the country’s banking system.
However, he said that given the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Central Bank of Japan needed to maintain its large-scale stimulus plan while paying close attention to the pros and cons of its policies.
“The Central Bank of Japan fully recognizes that, under continued monetary easing, the power of financial institutions will be increasingly affected,” said Toyoshi Kuroda in Nagoya’s speech to corporate leaders.
He argued that the banking system could be volatile in the event of serious negative shocks if financial institutions were more proactive in taking on the risks to compensate for the shrinking profit margins caused by low interest rates over the years.
“Although these risks are not so great at present, the central bank will follow the situation closely and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures,” he said.
The minutes of the meeting of the Central Bank of Japan, which were published earlier on Monday, showed that the cost of long-term easing policies was rising during the September summit, which was discussed by the Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Japan.
The minutes of the meeting showed that, according to one member, “the central bank of Japan will have more policy flexibility in the future if the economy continues to expand.”
The minutes of the meeting showed that another member argued that, given the limitations of the duration of the policy, the Committee should discuss how long the central bank of Japan could sustain the stimulus policy.
According to Dong-il Kuroda, the Central Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks associated with easing policies, while also taking into account the uncertainty surrounding Japan’s economic prospects, which could affect global demand as a result of friction in Central American trade and rising protectionism.
“The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is limited for the time being,” said Toyoko Kuroda.
“How the problem persists, however, the impact on the Japanese economy may become greater,” he added.
“There is a need to sustain strong monetary easing policies while considering both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner,” said Toshio Kuroda.
Despite the increase in the ills of radical stimulus schemes, such as long-term low interest rates, which erode the profitability of financial institutions, low inflation has forced the Central Bank of Japan to maintain the scheme.
The Central Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks of a global trade war dispute, the possibility of a recent increase in interest rates was ruled out.
1 June 2018, corporate logo of the Tesla electric vehicle, Cardiff, United States.
Under a settlement agreement, the United States Tesla car and its executive director, Mask, had agreed to pay a fine of $20 million to the financial regulator, and Mask would resign as the company ' s chairman but would remain in the CEO position.
The settlement agreement will end two months of turmoil in Tesla.
This settlement agreement for the alleged securities fraud disclosed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday would be a relief to investors.
Investors feared that protracted legal disputes would only further damage the still-deprived electric car company.
The SEC sued Mask for fraud on Thursday, alleging that its tweets of 7 August misled investors.
According to the tweets, he was considering privatizing Tesla at $420 per share and obtaining financing.
According to SEC, these tweets are virtually unfounded and the resulting market turmoil harms investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts argued that the agreement could reinforce Tesla, which had been hit hard by the recent behaviour of Mask.
Steven Heim, the head of Boston Common's asset management, said that the settlement agreement should have made Mask more supervised, without taking “destructive” measures to remove him from Tesla.
The asset management company held the stock of Panasonic, a battery manufacturer in Tesla.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla had to appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop controls over Mask ' s external communications.
“It is in the best interests of our markets and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, that the matter be resolved expeditiously under the agreed terms,” as Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
The charges on Thursday resulted in the evaporation of the market value of Tesla, which stood at $45.2 billion on Friday, down from $47.5 billion for general purpose vehicles.
In the settlement agreement, the SEC withdrew its demand to remove Mask from the post of head of the company.
Many investors claimed that the penalty would be catastrophic.
“I think this is the best possible outcome for all concerned,” Ivan Finnseth of Tigress Financial Partners said, Feinseth gave Tesla a “neutral” rating, and described the SEC punishment as “minus punishment” for Mask.
“His continuing as CEO is important to Tesla.”
Neither Mask nor Tesla recognized or denied the EC ' s allegations in the settlement agreement, nor did they respond immediately to the request for assessment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the courts.
The Beijing Morning News (Reporter Wang Ping) Beijing Morning News journalist learned a few days ago from the Beijing Builders Group that one of the core buildings of the Beijing World Park Park Park complex - the Beijing Garden Show Square project will, for the first time, use the multi-colour ETFE membrane structure, with 5440 m2 of membrane in deep red, dark green, orange, blue, red, green, six colours, and a “blonfle wings” under the Lasso steel line.
According to Liu Jiabao, the project leader of the Beijing Builders Five Group, the Circus Square project built an area of 4,500 square metres, installed a total of 1,182 tons of steel, and the steel structure was supported by a suspension steel rack with a 26-story umbrella, with a “butterfly wing” shaped under the pull of the Raso steel strang.
“From the sky, looking at the plaza, the colourful house is as if it were a flowered, twilight-dancing butterfly, and the colours of the colours will not fade with the passage of time and the blizzard of the wind.”
Previously, the monochrome ETFE membrane structure had been widely applied to bird nests, water cubes, etc., but the multicoloured ETFE membrane structure was the first in the country.
Journalists learned that since there are very few global suppliers with the capacity to produce multiple coloured structures, each inch of the structure material is “precious”.
Liu Changbao said that, in order to avoid problems such as overlapping and “fisting” positions, the “double fork” header structure would also be innovative, ensuring that the “fist” header beam was in the right place through a specially designed fixed plug.
The construction of the World Park Park complex in Beijing is currently under way.
Of these, the international pavilion project has completed all the “parachute” suspension works.
It is planned that the conditions for the display will be in place by the end of October.

Reuters September 30th - CSRC officially released its revised Code of Corporate Governance on Sunday, which focuses on, inter alia, further strengthening restrictions on controlling shareholders, de facto controllers and their associates, placing greater emphasis on the protection of small and medium-sized investors and playing the role of a small and medium-sized investor protection agency, as well as actively drawing on international experience to promote the participation of institutional investors in corporate governance.
The CVM noted that the revised guidelines covered the basic concepts and principles of publicly listed corporate governance, the composition and functioning of shareholder conferences, boards of directors, supervisory boards and executives, the rights and obligations of directors, supervisors and executives, incentive binding mechanisms for listed companies, and the conduct of controlling shareholders and their associates.

The revised guidelines require listed companies to implement the concept of innovation, harmonization, green, open and shared development in corporate governance, to increase the requirements for listing parties and to strengthen the leading role of listed companies in environmental protection and social responsibility.
Strengthen the role of the Audit Committee of the Board of Trustees in establishing the basic framework for environmental, social responsibility and corporate governance (ESG) information disclosure.
In addition, in response to concerns, the new guidelines also introduced new requirements for control stability faced by listed corporate governance, the functioning of independent directors, high-level evaluation and incentive mechanisms for listed companies, and enhanced disclosure of information.

Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Monday that China ' s opening of the door would not be closed, but would only be larger and greater, and that the move towards a higher level of openness would not stop.
The expansion of imports is not an equity measure, but a long-term consideration for the future, and China ' s imports of goods and services are expected to exceed $30 trillion and $10 trillion, respectively, over the next 15 years.
Xi Jinping delivered a keynote address at the first China International Import Expo, and China will further reduce tariffs, accelerate the development of new industries, such as cross-border power suppliers, continuously liberalize market access, promote the opening of services, and ease foreign equity restrictions in areas such as education, health, etc., where there is a large gap in the domestic market.

He stated that China would urgently study the phased development of a free trade port policy and institutional system in Hainan and accelerate the process of exploring the construction of a China-specific free trade port; the addition of a new Shanghai trade zone; and the establishment of a panel at the Shanghai Pass Exchange and a pilot registration system to support the development of regional integration in the Yangtze Delta, which had been elevated to a national strategy.
“China's economy is a sea, not a small pond.
When the wind is calm, and when the storm is heavy, Xi Jinping calls it, “The storm can turn the pond, but not the sea.
After countless storms, the sea is still there!
After 5,000 years of hardship, China is still there!
For the future, China will always be here."
He noted that economic globalization had suffered a great deal, that multilateralism and the free trade regime had been shaken, that instability remained numerous and that risk challenges had increased, and that open cooperation was an important engine for enhancing international economic and trade cooperation, and that countries should maintain openness, expand space for mutually beneficial development and enhance macroeconomic coordination.
He re-emphasized that China ' s opening of doors would not be closed, but would only be larger and greater, and that the move towards a higher level of openness would not stop.
China will stimulate the potential for imports, adapt to the upward trend in domestic consumption, and take more active and effective measures to boost the income of the population and foster medium- and high-end consumer growth points.

Referring to China ' s economic outlook, Xi Jinping indicated that, in terms of key indicators such as economic growth, employment, prices, balance of payments, business profits, fiscal revenues and labour productivity, China ' s economic performance was within reasonable boundaries, laying an important foundation for the achievement of the year ' s objectives.
In comparison with other major economies, China ' s economic growth remains among the highest in the world.
“The fundamentals of healthy and stable economic development in China have not changed, the factors of production that underpin high-quality development have not changed, and the overall momentum for long-term stability has not changed.”
Xi Jinping said that there was no room for optimism about China ' s prospects for economic development.
According to Xi Jinping, China ' s macroeconomic regulatory capacity is growing and has many favourable conditions for the long-term healthy and stable development of its economy. China ' s economic development is currently confronted with outstanding contradictions and problems, and measures are being taken to actively address them. The results have been and are being demonstrated.
“Believes that China’s economy will be able to accelerate its transition to a high-quality development path, provided that it remains strategically determined, that it deepens its reforms and opening up in a comprehensive manner, and that the lower atmosphere resolves the outstanding contradictions and problems.” Xi Jinping states.

The Secretary-General of Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium, instilling firm confidence in the transition of the private economy to a wider arena.
The Secretary-General of Xi Yingping stressed that “let entrepreneurs take off the burden of thinking and move on lightly” created a strong resonance among a wide range of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market dynamism comes from people, especially entrepreneurs, and from entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening-up, there have been millions of stories of entrepreneurial innovation, and the growth and growth of the entrepreneurial community has constantly driven China ' s economy forward.
For some time now, people in society have made some negative and skeptical statements about the private economy.
Misperceptions such as the so-called “private economy abstinence” and the “new public-private partnership” have raised doubts and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
Recently, a number of private enterprises have encountered difficulties and problems in their development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some exporting firms; rapid adjustment of demand structures has put pressure on transformation and upgrading; some policies have been uncoordinated, policy effects have overlapped, or the working methods have been simple, leading to the opposite effect of some initially well-intentioned policies.
The combination of factors, the difficulties of the private economy, the difficulties of some private enterprises, and the anxiety of entrepreneurs.
In this context, it is particularly relevant to correct the misperceptions of perceptions, to remove the burden of entrepreneurship, to allow enterprises to pursue development with one mind, to promote development with one heart and with the other, as well as with regard to market confidence and development expectations.
The symposium once again highlighted the important conclusion of the “three unchanged”: “The status and role of the non-public economy in the economic and social development of the country has not changed!”
From further decentralization, the establishment of a power inventory system to the creation of a legal and legal environment for the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, the creation of a level playing field and a society-wide climate of respect for entrepreneurs, in recent years the attention and institutional safeguards of the party ' s central authorities have been unprecedented.
The symposium was a clear demonstration of policy initiatives that strongly supported the six dimensions of private enterprise development and launched a series of practical actions aimed at “light-loading forwards” for private enterprises.
All this is a source of great encouragement for the entrepreneurial community and greater expectations for all sectors of society.
The fog spreads, the guidelines are set, and the key is implementation.
It is important to constantly create a better development environment for the private economy, to help private enterprises to solve the difficulties of development and to help to upgrade China ' s economic transition; to make entrepreneurs feel fair in the competition of the market, secure in their legitimate operations, respectful in the life of society, and to stimulate innovative dynamism and creative potential.
The Chinese economy entered the process of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to pursue their ambitions and providing greater space and arena for their creativity.
We have reason to believe that, as reforms are further deepened and obstacles removed, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and opportunities, leading to a wider arena.
All 46 regulatory certificates of the Inner Mongolia import/export chain are verified online - new in-line
According to Sino-New and Hote's 5 November call (journalist Lee Aiping) and the 5 November news from Hothe Customs, all 46 regulatory certificates of the local import and export chain have been verified online since that date, except for exceptional circumstances such as the need for confidentiality.
Inner Mongolia enterprises can declare relevant documents to customs in a paperless manner, avoiding the problems of past on-site run-off, paper applications, repeated submissions, etc.
It is understood that the lead time for document preparation, which refers to the preparation time for the various types of documents required for the import and export chain prior to the declaration, is a major factor affecting the overall clearance time, which must be reduced if customs clearance time is to be reduced and customs clearance costs reduced.
Previously, 86 types of regulatory documents had been required for customs verification at the import and export levels, involving 19 departments.
This time, according to the principle of “cancan be cancelled, can be merged, can be withdrawn from check-out at ports”, the international trade “single window” platform, customs interfaces with 16 other licensing agency systems and data interconnections, leading to data multi-routine and less business-legged.
Customs stated that in the past, businesses were required to submit paper applications to and from the field halls of the departments concerned and that the process was lengthy and did not allow for real-time follow-up of the audit status.
Business users now have direct access to the “Single Window” portal for online applications.
The electronic transmission of certificate data to Customs following clearance by the licensing authority and the automated matching of customs clearance data, intelligent verification at the customs clearance point, the results of which are sent to the enterprise through a single window in a uniform manner and the full-process web-based processing of regulatory document declarations, clearances, customs clearances and feedback is achieved.
The export of Han Xin chicken soup to China has increased 20 times in four years or is associated with an increase in the number of young people in an empty nest - the new Chinese net.
The export of Han Xin chicken soup to China has increased 20 times in four years, and the analysis is related to an increase in the number of young people in empty nests.
KLA reported on 5 that last year Korean chicken soup exports to China totalled more than $100,000, a sharp increase of about 20 times over the year 2013, four years ago.
According to the analysis, this increase is related to the increase in the number of young people in empty nests in China, which is responsible for facilitating the sale of food, as well as to the increased interest of young people in nutritious food.
This data was published on 5th day by the Korea Agricultural and Aquatic Food Circulation Society (AT).
Last year, Korean chicken soup exports to China amounted to $1003.39 million, weighing 21.859 million kg, a sharp increase of 2094 per cent and 3668.8 per cent, respectively, compared to 2013.
The analysis found that the increase in sales of Chinese chicken soup in China is related to the increase in the number of young people in empty nests, which is responsible for facilitating the sale of food, as well as to the increased interest of young people in nutritious food.
As of this year, one-person households in China have broken the 200 million mark and are expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020, and local food companies have been targeting the “single” for a variety of convenient food items.
In addition, the analysis indicates that avian influenza is the single biggest impediment to the mainland Chinese market for gin chicken soup.
According to aT, the avian influenza epidemic in Korea between November 2016 and April of last year, with a total ban on exports of chicken soup to China by the authorities, resulted in a sharp decline in exports.
In 2016, Chinese chicken soup exports to China amounted to $840,000, and exports fell sharply to $100,000 last year as a result of avian flu.

The official stated that the United States would continue to do so in the future, as it had done in the past, on a routine and regular mission of free navigation.
It was also reported that United States President Trump accused Beijing of attempting to interfere in the United States Congress elections and of putting pressure on Beijing on behalf of Washington into a new phase.
This followed in May this year the entry of two United States naval vessels into the sea near the islands of the South China Sea, over which China claims sovereignty.
A comment from Washington suggested that this could provoke China at a time of tension between China and the United States.

On the occasion of the celebration of the National Day, a flag-raising ceremony was held at the mouth of the Central Viet Nam border.
“I can’t imagine such a spectacular flag-raising ceremony at the border, which is more shocking than watching the flag-raising in the interior.”
In the morning of 1 January, Mr. Zhang, who traveled from Sichuan to the Yunnan River Port on the border between China and China, and together with more than 500 troops, residents and tourists from China, watched the ceremony to raise the country ' s doors and celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China.
The estuary is the largest port in the Yunnan sector of the Central Viet Nam border and is located in Yunnan Province, Red River River State, Riverfront County, across the river with Viet Nam's old street city, and is a State-type port.
As the country's “one-way” construction deepens, and as one of the most convenient routes for China to connect to South-East Asia, the flow of border crossings from and to the estuary has steadily increased.
At 7.30 a.m. on the same day, as the sun just opened, the local population of the estuary and tourists from the centre and the far side gathered early in the restricted area of the estuary to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 0745 hours, the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the members of the National Tribute Brigade at the border checkpoint at the mouth of the river stunned, escorting the flag to the flag-raising table at a robust pace.
Following the commanding officer's instructions to raise the flag, the raiser swarms his arms out of an arc, and the bright five-star red flag stretches its flag like the eagle's wings, as the national anthem slowly rises.
“The national day-raising ceremony, held at every significant time of New Year’s Day, Spring Day, and National Day, not only displayed the image of China, but also inspired the love of the nation’s peoples.”
The ceremonial troops who took part in this flag-raising ceremony said so.
According to the information received, the National Tribute Brigade, which is responsible for the flag-raising ceremony at the estuary, consists of more than 40 troops from various positions at the estuary border checkpoint, from the three-person flag-raising team to the size of the Tribune, which has gone through more than 60 years, and has carried out more than 70 ceremonial missions at the national level since its establishment.
The newly revised personal income tax law adjusts the criteria for determining the income tax of residents of China from one full year to 183 days.
In order to maintain policy stability, China ' s Ministry of Finance and the relevant head of the State Tax Administration indicated on 30th that the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing preferential arrangements for persons outside China, including Hong Kong and Macao.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that the implementing regulations of the current personal income tax law provide for special concessions for the taxation of persons outside China. Individuals who do not have a residence in China but who have resided for more than one year or more than five years may pay only a portion of their personal income tax paid by a unit or individual in China.
The portion paid outside China is not subject to personal income tax in China.
The Chinese Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxes, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce also issued circulars extending the application of the policy of withholding income tax from foreign investors in order to distribute profit direct investment.
The allocation of profits to offshore investors from residential enterprises in China for direct domestic investment is suspended from the application of the pre-tax policy, and the foreign investment incentive category is expanded to cover all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and areas.
During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, some positive messages were released around the Korean peninsula.
The Korean President recapitulated the DPRK's “irreversible” determination to abandon nuclear power in the past and said that US President Trump and Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un might meet before the end of this year.
The United States Department of State subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeyo would visit the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea in October to facilitate the implementation of the commitments made by the leader of the United States and the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea, Singapore, to meet.
From the beginning of this year to the present, inter-Korean efforts to break the ice have opened the way to dialogue, with inter-Korean, inter-Korean and United States leaders meeting, the continuation of the general trend towards de-escalation of the situation on the peninsula and the adherence to the principle of dialogue in resolving the problems of the peninsula.
First, “the essence of the question of the peninsula is security” remains the same, and the key to achieving peace on the peninsula is the proper and balanced resolution of the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than the mere exertion of pressure on the other side to emphasize its own claims.
Secondly, in the dialogue to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties are still divided on the steps and ways to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, and the “who will first” game of thought remains strong, owing to the long-standing lack of political trust between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States.
At the Council's previous open meeting on the Korean peninsula, held at United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties surrounding the issue of sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea once again highlighted these two points of “no change” with regard to the peninsula.
United States Secretary of State Pompeyo insisted that the sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea would not be lifted until the Korean peninsula was completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, on the other hand, stressed the principle of “action in response”, noting that “the downward trend in sanctions should be the same as the step taken by North Korea on the step-by-step nuclear path”.
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement fully, fully and accurately the resolutions of the Security Council relating to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but the imposition of pressure is not an end, and that the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are the requirements of the resolutions of the Council, both of which must not be set aside or chosen.
As stated by the Chinese State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Wang Yi, and in the light of the current positive developments in inter-Korean and inter-Korean relations with the United States, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider the timely activation of reversible provisions, thereby encouraging the DPRK and the parties concerned to take further steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process require sufficient political courage on all sides.
At the present time, and in the face of the growing expectations of the international community for a political solution to the issue of the peninsula, the parties concerned should, in particular, demonstrate political vigour, make political decisions, fulfil their commitments, resolve their difficulties, and continue to make parallel steps towards the denuclearization of the peninsula and the establishment of a peaceful mechanism on the peninsula in order to bring about a lasting peace on the peninsula.
The People ' s Government of the Kigang District, Pingxi Province, Shanxi Province, has reported on a one-day basis that during the National Day, the Yellow River Casket Area, located in the county, will remain at a relatively high water level and will not be open.
In order to ensure security, the scenery area was temporarily closed during the National Day.
Yellow pot mouth waterfall is the second largest waterfall in China, the largest yellow waterfall in the world.
Yellow rivers flow here, and the walls of the two sides are stunned, and the mouths of the river are bound as narrow as the mouths of the pots, forming an air of “a pot of yellow rivers of thousands of miles”.
According to journalists, the yellow river period of June to October of each year began on 12 July 2018, with the closure of the yellow river canal area in the west of the mountain, due to its high water levels, for a cumulative period of almost one month.
Nie Woo Feng, the chief engineer of the Cattleview Regional Council, said to the media that this was the longest high water level in the Yellow River in nearly 20 years, “not so long ago, we closed in 2017 for four days, and this year for almost a month.”
It is understood that, in order to meet the eleventh week of gold, the yellow river canal waterfalls in Shanxi were also pre-positioned with additional staffing and vehicle maintenance, and even the hiring of temporary staff.
According to the circular issued by the Office of the Yellow River General Command for Drought Control and Drought Control, on the implementation of the yellow river during the National Day, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Xanxi, Henan and Shandong provinces were asked to do the yellow river during the National Day.
Currently, the main flow of the Yellow River is large, with the flow of the upper river remaining at 2,000 to 3,000 cubic metres per second, the flow of the middle river remaining at 2,500 to 3,500 cubic metres per second, and the flow of the lower river remaining at 3,000 cubic metres per second.
Influenza vaccination services are provided at health centres and health stations, especially during the national holiday.
This year, the Department of Health ordered 150,000 doses of a four-priced influenza vaccine for 2018-2019, giving priority at this stage to high-risk persons for free vaccination against influenza during public holidays. In particular, the health centres and health posts under the Department of Health provide vaccination services from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. during the national holiday (on 1 and 2 October).
In addition to the above-mentioned measures for the population, the Health Centres and Health Stations under the Department of Health have, since the introduction of the programme, extended the services for influenza vaccination from Monday to Friday to 8 p.m., with 4,158 vaccinations as of 4 p.m. on 30 September, and more than 3,714 as compared to the same period last year.
Free vaccinations are provided to the following Macao residents: persons under the age of 6 months to 18, persons under the age of 50 and above, pregnant women, all chronically ill persons, including obese persons (i.e. persons with a physical quality index BMI of 30 or more), as well as to persons working in institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, all health workers, and residents of Macao who work in play fairs.
At the same time, other persons, including in the public sector, whom the Department of Health deems necessary to inoculate, will take the initiative to contact the relevant agencies to obtain the list and arrange the vaccination at the health centre.
In order to facilitate inoculations and reduce waiting times, the Department of Health will send health-care personnel between October and December of this year to primary schools, primary schools, kindergartens and day-care centres to provide group influenza vaccinations to young children, young and middle-school students, teachers and employees, etc. In addition, the Department of Health will arrange for group vaccinations to be carried out in homes for the elderly and the disabled, the larger public sector or other institutions, etc.
Students and young children who are unable to take group vaccinations may be vaccinated at the vaccination stations or health centres of the General Hospital of the Count of Jen, on 3 December 2018, with the Macao identity card, the Health Board user card, the influenza vaccination card, if any, the student certificate, the employee certificate or the professional certificate.
The Department of Health reminded the population that, between September 2017 and August 2018, persons who had been vaccinated against the influenza from 2017 to 2018 had yet to be vaccinated against a new flu season since September 2018, as the influenza antigen component of the Northern Hemispheric influenza vaccine from 2018 to 2019 was updated to target the seasonal flu from the winter of 2018 to 2019 and the summer of 2019 in the northern hemisphere.
The peak of the influenza in Macao usually occurs in January-March of each year, later than in temperate regions (e.g., North China and Japan). The Health Department calls on high-risk persons, such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese persons and chronic patients, who are more vulnerable to complications following the influenza, and those who are in constant contact with high-risk persons, to be vaccinated as soon as possible.

On the evening of 29 September, the journalist was informed by the Advocacy Department of the Qing Baijiang District Committee in Cheng City that, on the evening of 29 September Beijing time, a central European row (Sengdu), full of goods such as car connectors, telescopes, LCD screens, was converted through the Chemian Nufka port in Poland and turned to Nuremberg, Germany.
This was the first time that the country ' s Central European bane opened the Polish Chemianufka crossing line, marking the successful opening of yet another European transport route, following Mara, Chopp, in Central Europe.
The Central European class started on 14 September at a station in Chengdu Qingqing Shih River, exited through Mount Ara, entered Europe via the Polish Chemianufka crossing, and eventually arrived in Nuremberg, Germany, for a total of about 16 days.
For the first time, the Central European Platoon travels here to perform the shift-wide and line-tracking reloading exercise.
The opening of the crossing effectively addressed the problems of long operations and long periods of time caused by the current traffic congestion at the Mara crossing, raised the ban on transport and provided new solutions to the problem of traffic congestion at the Mara crossing, further enhanced the transport capacity and efficiency of China ' s western hinterland to the Euro-Mediterranean market, and laid a solid foundation for the opening of the European market by the Central European ban.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Sulawesi, Indonesia, occurred on Friday, and more than 400 people have now been confirmed dead, many of whom have been swept away by the earthquake-induced tsunami.
The authorities expect a significant increase in the total number of Sunday deaths as new data are reported in remote areas.
Dozens of people are reportedly still trapped in the ruins of a hotel and a shopping mall in the city of Baru.
The earthquake triggered a wave of up to six metres (20 feet) that struck the city of Baru.
To date, only the number of deaths has been from Baru, the number of deaths reported in Dungla, north of Baru, is slow, and the authorities are preparing for a worse situation.
The population of Donguela, with 300,000 inhabitants, is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
According to Vice-President Kara of Indonesia, the total number of deaths is likely to rise to thousands.
On Friday, as the waves hit the coast at dusk, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate the festival, many were washed away by the waves and everything was destroyed wherever the waves went.
1 October, Tokyo - A quarterly short-sighted survey published by the Central Bank of Japan on Monday showed that the confidence of large Japanese manufacturers in the September season had reached its lowest level in more than a year, owing to the rising cost of raw materials and the effects of a series of natural disasters on production, which put pressure on businesses.
The survey hardly shows that the escalating global trade friction has eroded the confidence of large manufacturers.
The risk of a full-scale trade war, however, undermines business prospects and can threaten corporate capital spending.
Active capital expenditure is one of the bright spots in the Japanese economy.
The survey called into question the view of the Central Bank of Japan that a sound economic expansion would help to accelerate inflation to the 2 per cent target, despite indications that firms were gradually passing costs on to customers.
“In the context of the fears raised by the global trade war, the confidence of manufacturers has stagnated as a result of the slowdown in exports and weak factory production,” expressed Nan Wuzhin, the chief researcher at the Golden General Research Institute in Agroforestry.
“Consumption is still high. And I don’t think confidence will continue to decline as business profits improve and prices rise.”
Short-view surveys show that the large manufacturing landscape judgement index in September fell from positive 21 three months ago to positive 19 and deteriorated for the third consecutive season.
The market estimate is a positive median of 22.
In September, the large non-manufacturing weather judgement index fell from a positive 24 to a positive 22 survey in June, with the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey was positive 22.
The survey showed that both large manufacturing and non-manufacturing climate judgement indices remained stable in December.
Investors do not care about the decline in the short-term business landscape judgement index, which rises on Monday, N 225, to a 27-year high, as a result of the continuous depreciation of the yen, helping to improve the export profitability prospects of Japanese enterprises.
Capital expenditure is robust.
Despite the decline in corporate confidence, the latest short view highlights the robustness of business capital expenditure plans, the benefits of renewed capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to respond to labour shortages caused by population ageing.
A survey by central banks shows that large enterprises planned to increase capital spending by 13.4 per cent in the current fiscal year until March 2019.
The previous short view survey was 13.6 per cent.
Nan Wuzhi said that capital spending on all enterprises was planned to increase by 8.5 per cent in the current fiscal year, close to the pace of Japan’s bubble economy.
“There is still room for further growth in capital spending, given the increase in small-scale enterprises’ forecast of profits from now on, but much depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence.”
The short-sighted survey, which showed the increased ability of enterprises to transfer costs and the positive 7 price index for large enterprises, a decade-long high, was an encouraging sign of the progress made in Japan ' s efforts to combat deflation.
The index for measuring employment in large enterprises, reaching negative 23, is the most compact level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
Thanks to strong corporate spending, the second quarter of the Japanese economy rebounded from the contraction of January-March this year.
However, the upgrading of trade frictions in the summer and the disruption of the supply chain by natural disasters have overshadowed the prospects of the Japanese economy, which is dependent on exports.
In United States dollars, the rate of increase in services imports and exports is 16.4 per cent.
The Ministry of Commerce website press release quoted the head of the Division of Services and Trade as stating that the total volume of imports and exports of new and emerging services exceeded $1 trillion in January-August, increasing faster than the total.
Of this total, the total volume of new services imports and exports was RMB 1,138,390 million, an increase of 20.9 per cent, higher than the overall rate of increase of 10.4 percentage points in services imports and exports, and the share of new services increased by almost 3 percentage points.
In the area of services exports, in January-August, services exports continued the rapid growth momentum since this year, with exports growing at a faster rate than imports at 5.7 percentage points.
Among these, the top three areas of acceleration were telecommunications computers and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, and insurance services, at 61.1 per cent, 38.8 per cent and 26.5 per cent, respectively.
The Officer-in-Charge of the Division also noted that the share of imports of new and emerging services had also risen steadily in January-August.
Emerging services imports grew rapidly in January-August, reaching 23.6 per cent of services imports, an increase of 1.6 percentage points over the same period last year.
Of these, imports of financial services, intellectual property, telecommunications computers and information services increased by more than 20 per cent, at 47.1 per cent, 23.3 per cent and 23.2 per cent, respectively.
Xi'er: Macy's replacement came to the field to help bring down the three rounds of the U.S. Bassa tournament.
Last night, the 7th round of Barcelona’s main battle against Bilbao was held, with the first half of De Marcos taking the lead, the second half of Macy taking over Munir’s flat score, and the end of the 1:1-square on both sides, after which three rounds of Bassa were won.
The war between Macy and Buskerz is over.
The score fell behind, and Macy came in the second half.
As the three-round league of Bassa, which had escaped, failed to win a victory on the royal horse, and remained at the top of the list on the basis of a net-win advantage, there was only one point between the third and the third Sevilla.

The price of oil, or the “three-in-a-kind” rise, can be fully replenished ahead of schedule on the occasion of the national holiday.
On 30 September, at 2400 hours, a new round of price-fixing windows for finished oils will be opened in conjunction with the long holiday on the National Day.
A number of agencies forecast a substantial increase in oil prices to achieve a “three-in-one” increase.
The owners of the car, who plan to travel on their own, can fill the car with oil before the price increases.
Based on data from crowd-based estimates, it is estimated that the relative increase in domestic finished oils will be around $190 per ton, and 220 per ton.
In September, there were two increases in oil prices: 180 ton for petrol on 3 September, 170 ton for diesel, 145 ton for petrol on 17 September and 145 ton for diesel on 17 September.
Domestic oil prices are tied to international oil prices, and international oil prices have risen since the current round of pricing cycles, and Brent crude oil has continued to be explored after it has crossed the $80 threshold.
As of 28 September, the collection of the United States WTI crude oil futures increased by $1.13, to $73.25 per barrel.
Brent's crude oil futures increased by US$ 1.0 to US$ 82.72 per barrel.
“In the light of the international situation, tensions, such as the United States sanctions against Iran, and the overall lopsided trend in oil prices, followed by a clear refusal by the OPEC Conference to increase production, giving market confidence, and a steady upturn in oil prices.”
According to Drogen's information-based oil analyst, Xu Wen.
On the retail side, the current prices for gasoline in Beijing, China ' s petrochemical gas stations, Nos. 92 and 95 are $7.66 and 8.15, respectively.
According to Li Ying, China's public information analyst, there has been no significant change in the marketing strategy for preferential promotion of gas stations, which currently have preferential margins of 0.5-0.7 yuan/l for major stations, such as Central petrochemicals, and 0.5-1.2 yuan/l for private stations.
“The retail price of this wheel is about to rise ‘three consecutively’, and the equivalent price rise is about US$0.14-0.16, suggesting that the owners of private cars should refuel before the long holiday of the National Day.”

Opening of the 69th International Astronautical Congress in Germany -- China New Network
The 69th International Astronautical Congress was inaugurated on 1 October at the Bremen Exhibition Centre in Germany by Xinhua Society Bremen, Germany, on 1 October, with the participation of more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and businesses, expert scholars and young students from all over the world.
In his opening address, the President of the International Astronautical Federation, Jean-Yve Legar, said that the cause of global space was no longer a mere minority of countries and institutions, and that the number of participants had increased significantly over the previous session this year, indicating that an increasing number of institutions and personalities were joining.
He called on States to strengthen cooperation and innovation and to work together to advance the cause of space.
In attending the exchange, the Vice-Minister of Industry and Informationization of China and Director of the National Space Agency, Zhang Ke Yiu, presented China ' s space programme and indicated that China would expand international cooperation in the field of space and contribute to the cause of space for mankind.
The participation of relevant institutions, such as the China Space Science and Technology Group, the China Space Science and Technology Group, and a number of private industry representatives demonstrated the latest achievements of Chinese space, including launch vehicles, satellites and space science and technology applications.
The International Astronautical Congress, which has been held annually since 1950, is the largest gathering of the world ' s aviation community.
The Congress, which lasted five days, was co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Centre for Applied Science and Technology and Microgravity Research of Bremen University and the International Institute of Space Law.
According to a press release issued by Reuters Beijing on 5 November - China ' s Foreign Trade Centre on Sunday, the Hiroshima Conference showed that China ' s foreign trade situation remained complex and serious, with 80.6 per cent of enterprises expected to export better than the previous year or even more flat throughout 2018.
However, given the continuing rise in the cost of domestic raw materials, labour, etc., and the increased impact of trade friction in Central America and the external environment, the participating enterprises considered that the export situation in the coming year was not promising.
At the closing press conference of the 124th ordinary session, the Deputy Secretary-General, the press spokesman and the Deputy Director of the China Foreign Trade Centre, Xu Jun, stated that the number of foreign buyers arriving and the export transaction at the current session had fallen by the same magnitude.
The number of participants in the current session, 189,812, came from 215 countries and territories, a decline of 1.11 per cent over the same period.
Exports amount to RMB 2,064,494 million (equivalent to $29,860 million), a decrease of 1 per cent over the same period.
From the market point of view, the South Korea deal grew by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2%, 2.5% for Japan, 10 ASEAN countries, BRIC countries, respectively, and fell by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3%, 0.8% for traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union, respectively.
In terms of industry, transport, mechanical equipment, building and decoration materials, consumer electronics and information products, bathing equipment grew by 24.8 per cent, 21.1 per cent, 20.0 per cent, 15.1 per cent, and 7.6 per cent respectively, while textile clothing and domestic appliances fell by 13.0 per cent, and 6.7 per cent, respectively.
Xu, as a barometer of China ' s foreign trade and as a sign of wind, said that the data on the participation and exports of the buyers at the current meeting showed that China ' s foreign trade development would continue to face a number of uncertainties and uncertainties in the coming year.
However, as the structural reforms on the supply side advanced, and recent national and local policy measures, such as the “six-stable” approach, China's new dynamic in the development of foreign trade is accelerating and new advances in the diversification of the enterprise market are essential foundations and strong conditions for the development of foreign trade.
“With a combination of factors, China’s foreign trade exports and imports are expected to continue to grow steadily throughout the year, with further improvements in quality and efficiency.”
The General Customs Administration of China announced a 14.5 per cent increase in exports in United States dollars in September, a 14.3 per cent increase in imports in September, a US$ 31,690 billion trade surplus in September, and the highest export growth and trade surplus since February this year.
Despite the escalating trade friction between China and the United States, China ' s export performance in September was significantly higher than expected, with strong external demand, the collapse of firms ' exports and devaluation of the renminbi before the United States imposed customs duties, or the main supporting factors, showing the resilience of China ' s foreign trade. However, China ' s trade war against confidence and the impact on the industrial chain cannot be underestimated, and analysts believe that the challenges of China ' s foreign trade may emerge in the fourth quarter or next year.
According to the Reuters survey, in September, the United States fund manager recommended an increase in cash holdings, maintaining a cautious stance as the United States and China began their latest round of reciprocal import duties, and the dispute showed no signs of détente.
However, the 12 fund managers participating in the survey recommended that North America ' s asset allocation increase to the highest level since June 2017, while the United Kingdom, the euro area and, in particular, emerging markets have declined.
The global equity allocation averaged 56.6 per cent and the bond ratio 35.5 per cent, largely in line with last month’s survey.
The most notable change was the increase in the cash distribution ratio to 5.1 per cent, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager from a large funder said, “Some economic data bring confidence to the market, but the war on trade remains the biggest concern, so it is better to be prepared to enter when the market falls.”
The Fund Manager, however, continued to favour equities in September, particularly United States equities, even though United States equities were considered to be overpriced.
Today, in China’s open landmark, the world’s first major national exhibition on the subject of imports – China’s International Import Expo – officially opened the scene of expectations.
An exhibition is like a "window" that gives the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Expo, people see moving towards a higher level of "open China"; with the "window" of the Expo, the world is welcomed as a mutually beneficial win-win with China's "reform open again".
“In the case of a country, openness is like a flutter of cocoon, which, while suffering for a while, will be replaced by a new life.”
Xi's general secretary's summary of the road to openness points to an important reason why “China can”.
Looking back at the 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which has dared to enter into the sea of the world's markets, has always faced all the risk challenges, despite the vortex and the wind, in an open posture, constantly unleashing its internal dynamics and increasing its competitiveness.
It can be said that China, with its own solid achievements, has strongly interpreted the value and meaning of openness.
At the beginning of a new history, the organization of an exposition on the subject of imports was a major decision taken by the Party’s central focus, Comrade Xi Jinping, to promote a new round of high-level external opening. It was a major initiative by China to open its markets to the world. It was a practical move by China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization. It demonstrated the strong and clear will that “China’s opening doors will not be closed, but will only grow wider”.
And the “one hard to ask” seat with a large number of participants is the biggest positive and optimal response to China’s broader, broader and deeper development of an open economy.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
The build-up of the walls of protectionism in some countries and the return to the old path of unilateralism have increased the international community ' s concerns about the prospects for free trade and added many uncertainties to the world economy, which is now warming.
In the context of such an era, this event on the other side of the Huang Pu River reflects China ' s defence of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets, shared future Chinese self-confidence and China to assume its responsibilities.
Solo, solo, so far away.
China's open-mindedness and embrace of the world have not only made a powerful contribution to its own development, but have also brought to the nations and regions of the world a tremendous “China opportunity”.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the building of a “one-way” together, the launching of the Asian Investment Bank, the establishment of the Silk Road Fund ... China has provided a range of international public goods, real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, and has given enterprises a “fast-rider” to China’s development.
The Expo is also such a public product, a large platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market with their distinctive high-quality products and services.
In addition to national enterprises, domestic consumers are the real beneficiaries.
By setting up this platform of “optimal excellence”, it provides a multi-channel, high-quality supply for the upgrading of consumption and meets the needs of the population in terms of individualization, pluralism and differentiation in consumption.
As China opens its doors, and the flow of goods and goods expands, the steps towards a better life will be stronger.
From a broader perspective, the significance of the Expo goes beyond economics and trade to a vision of the future that conveys the concepts of openness, inclusion, inclusion, balance and win-winness and forges a common understanding to meet today ' s challenges.
The world is better, China is better; China is better, the world is better.
We look forward to the great and successful outcome of the Expo for the world; we look even more forward to a higher level of “open China” and the world working together to build a bright future for the community of human destinies.
External media: A framework agreement between the United States and the United States on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The [summary] agreement includes Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States and the temporary exemption of the United States from customs duties on Canadian-produced cars.
According to external sources, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of 30 September local time that the United States and Canada had concluded a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It was revealed that the agreement included Canada ' s opening of its dairy market to the United States and the temporary exemption of the United States from customs duties on Canadian-produced vehicles.
On 27 last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary principled agreement to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement by the 31 August deadline set by the United States to extend the duration of the negotiations until 30 September.
Previously, Canada’s Foreign Minister Freeland’s spokesperson said that Canada would only sign a favourable agreement, “focusing on substance, not on a timetable. We will continue our consultations in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in Canada’s national interest.”
More than 90 per cent of Brazilian female voters stated that the presidential candidate did not take women's needs into account.
According to the South American Journal, data published recently by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) show that more than 90 per cent of the Brazilian female population does not believe that the presidential candidate takes women ' s needs into account.
It was reported that the number of women in Brazil had now reached 107 million, and that if Brazilian women were brought together to form a country, the country's population would be 13th in the world, twice the population of Spain as a whole.
In Brazil, where women account for 52 per cent of voters and men 48 per cent of voters, the proportion of women in the Brazilian Congress is only 10 per cent, although the proportion of women among voters is very high.
Brazilian women ' s participation in politics is only 154th out of 193 countries worldwide, higher than in Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women have still not succeeded in acquiring their rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori pointed out that this phenomenon was the result of the combined role of ancient patrilineal societies, racism and capitalist values.
“Political should have been a national’s claim to citizenship, identity, access to public goods, and a society of multiple social groups. But Brazilian politics is a monopoly of a certain group, and the majority of the population is not represented.”
A previous study by the Brazilian Automobile Institute (Locomotiva) also pointed out that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not feel that elected politicians could represent their rights, 90 per cent did not agree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93 per cent did not agree with the current government policy on governance.
“We need to reverse the underrepresentation of women in parliament, and Brazil’s political system continues to be affected by inequality. So far, Brazil’s political sphere has been marked by serious gender, class, and racial discrimination.”
Despite the lack of women ' s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76 per cent of women believed that they could make a difference in democratic elections and 72 per cent were interested in politics.
In addition, 55 per cent of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to subject women to less prejudice.
On 1 October, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony to mark the 69th birthday of the new China.
More than 80 representatives of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, news agencies in Kazakhstan, financial institutions, Chinese enterprises, Chinese diasporas, Confucius and students attended the event.
On 1 October, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-raising ceremony to greet the 69th birthday of the new China.
Following the flag-raising ceremony, the Ambassador of China to Pakistan, Zhang Xing, stated that, on the occasion of the 69th birthday of the great motherland, we had a profound patriotic educational campaign in other countries where we had a great flag-raising ceremony.
Although you have lived abroad for a long time, you are always a great country.
Zhang Xing said that the Chinese nation is today closer than ever to the great goal of achieving its national renaissance and to the centre of the world stage.
“Our mission, our responsibilities and our work are more honourable, arduous and onerous than ever before.”
Zhang Xing stressed the need to remember the original and the mission, to promote the construction of a “one-way” by the Chinese-Pakistani Communist Party, to make a steady and deep journey, and to draw a more beautiful “one-way” by building a “one-way” “workbook”, and to devote all its energy to the development of the country, and to the development of a friendly cooperation between China and Pakistan.
The T2 terminal at Kirin International Airport, Guangxi, was inaugurated on 30 days.
According to Zhao Le Qin, the Secretary-General of the Central Communist Party's Guiling City Council, the opening of the new terminal will meet the annual demand for 12 million passengers and will create a new advantage in the air traffic of Gui Lin, which will be of great importance for the further development of the modern three-dimensional traffic patterns of the Guangxi River, the sea- and iron-coalition, the surface and the sea, and the air port-linking “four-bit one”.
Kiirin is expected to receive 90 million visitors this year.
The expansion of the T2 terminal and the pedagogic accompaniment at the two Rivers International Airport is a major public benefit project for the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Guangxi Gang Autonomous Region, as well as a landmark project for the construction of the Guilin International Tourist resort.
The project began in December 2015 with a construction area of 100,000 square metres, with a total investment of RMB 3.258 billion, and will be operational to meet the annual requirements of 12 million passengers, 10.12 million fly-offs, and 95,000 tons of mail-to-mail.
On the same day, more than 200 flights took off and landed at the T2 terminal at Gjilin International Airport.
The design of the new terminal is inspired by the waters of Guilin Hill, a long view of a mountain cinnamon, near the "Long Ridge Trailing Field" and the tangled roofs of the people of Guibei, where the waters of Guilin Hill are conjoined.
The new terminal at Guilin airport was described as meeting the peak flow of approximately 4,000 people per hour to and from the port, using smart baggage sorting systems, security integration platforms, face recognition, etc., as a technical tool for “intellectual empty ports”, and planning commercial zones covering a wide range of trades, such as catering, department stores, tax exemptions and leisure.
As growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets is largely not encouraging, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine of global economic growth.
On 23 September 2018, a container cargo ship docked in a port, New Jersey, United States of America.
However, as the current growth in the United States has benefited from the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts, the economy has also received close attention from the outside world.
“As the United States regains full employment, the economic downturn is inevitable.”
The only question, he said, was when it would happen, which, in his view, would probably only not be pushed back.
Despite Barclay ' s optimism about the United States economic outlook by the end of the year, the Bank acknowledged that it was more difficult to forecast further time.
“In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the potential for economic growth, the current growth stimulated by fiscal policy will not be sustainable”, the Barclay economist said in a study.
“In the absence of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing of the economy in 2020 will rise,” they said.
A series of business surveys will show in general terms that the major economies are at the end of the third quarter at the stage of the economic cycle.
The euro area and United States manufacturing surveys, which are due to be published next Monday, will receive attention, and the services survey will be published on Wednesday.
But next week's data will certainly focus on the non-farm employment data of the United States, which will be published next Friday, and will provide clues as to whether the tight employment market is driving wage growth.
Its importance, not only because of its importance to the profitability of enterprises and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because of salary hikes or overall inflation increases, may be a source of concern for officials of the United States Federal Reserve (Federal Reserve/FED).
“Payroll will be of great concern, as the ring may rise again significantly over the previous month.
The rise in September over the same period of the previous year may not have been over 3%, but we can well expect a breakthrough next month, as the Netherlands International Group (ING) economist wrote in a study.
The political situation in Europe could become a source of market volatility at a time when vacations in China and other parts of Asia had led to a bleak data profile for the region next week.
The Italian government ignores previous financial commitments to the EU, and the rest of the EU member states will have to quickly determine whether or not to oppose Italy’s decision. Tria does not support the decision, and he hopes to abide by EU rules.
The annual meeting of the British Conservative Party in Birmingham may also be sparkling as the British retreat talks enter a critical phase.
At the same time, the concerns surrounding emerging markets are unlikely to diminish as Brazil holds the hoped-for presidential elections next weekend.
[Summary] The ship, when completed, will be placed at the disposal of the East China Sea Division of the National Oceanic Administration of China, and Chen Xuan, Chief of the Observatory of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, stated that its operationalization would be of great importance for the development of the offshore ocean observing system of China and the promotion of global ocean observations.
On 29 September, China's first 3,000-ton-class large-scale buoy ship, the “Sun red 22” ship, was in the water of the China Warships Group.
The completion of the ship will break the current equipment bottlenecks in China ' s safeguards work on large buoys, submarine placement, recycling, looting, etc.
The `Girl 22' wheels are used mainly for regular buoy/submarine cruise maintenance, regular placement, recycling, contingency placement of buoys/submarine, recovery, recovery, repair, etc., as well as the ability to carry out integrated marine survey missions, such as gap surveys.
The new ship is 89 metres long, 18 metres wide, 7.2 metres deep and has a continuous capacity of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Xiao, Deputy General Manager of the Warships Group, said: “The 22 ships to Yang Hong are our first large buoy operating vessel, and the only one in the country with 10 metres of large buoy operations, will further enhance our large buoy security capability.”
It is understood that the ship, once completed, will be placed at the disposal of the East China Sea Division of the National Oceanic Administration of China, and Chen Xuan, Chief of the Observation Service of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, stated that its operationalization would be of great importance for the development of the offshore ocean observing system of China and the promotion of global ocean observations.
“The vessel, which is simultaneously equipped with large-scale buoy-laying and maintenance operations, as well as with an integrated maritime survey capability, is our first integrated vessel dedicated to the operation of mid- and long-sea buoys and the integrated maritime survey.
With such a buoy ship, our ocean observation and ocean survey will now have a powerful sharp instrument.”
The first day of the race was postponed to 1 October at the Tsingji Island Power Station, Qingjia, which was scheduled to open on 30 September, under the influence of typhoon “Pangmi”, and a pre-game meeting was held at the Qingdao Osing Centre, where the captains of 12 water-wing double-hull fleets from six countries and territories were present.
Under the influence of the typhoon “Bullet” and the heavy winds in the pool, the maximum speed of which was 24 knots, the departure signal was delayed by almost 90 minutes from 1 p.m. on 30 p.m., the wind was not reduced, and the competition was postponed until the afternoon of 1 October, when Anne Mdrand, the Managing Director of the competition, announced the cancellation of the first day of the competition.
“The strong winds from the shore continue, and the state of the sea is so intense.”
Mdrand explains that: “In this case, no one knows when the wind will strike at the ship.
A race near the city, in the current state of affairs, is the wisest option to cancel the race.”
There is still some disappointment on the part of all prepared crews.
"The ship is ready to stop, and we're in good shape."
Max Richardson, the Qingjia rudder, said: "But I know it's the right choice to change the game, and I hope the wind is smaller today, and we can do it."
Omika Wilkinson, known as the New Zealand team of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, said, “The loss of a day makes the game more interesting.
'Cause today's game's gonna get bigger, and there's only two days left.
We're all going to have to work so hard."
Despite the winds of the sea, the French ABM rudder, Pierre Ives Durand, met before the race to appeal his own warmth with the race to host the Qingdao Island: five years ago, the International Expeditions Series had its own accidental injury, broken muscles, and thanks to the handling of the local race medical team, it was possible to stand on the playing field today, five years later.
According to the information received, the International Expeditions Series, which was launched in 2007, is a world sail league event known as the Volvo, the American Cup, the World sailboats versus tour.
The Aoshima Station competition will use the FlyingPhantom.
The year 2018 was the eighth year in which the race landed on Qingdao Island, the capital of the sailboat, and Qingdao Station was also the battle to take over the series of competitions.
Despite the persistence of worldwide financial market shocks, the Hong Kong Financial Authority reported on Monday that foreign exchange fund investment revenues fell significantly by 97 per cent in the third quarter of this year, but were better than in the previous quarter, and that foreign exchange losses were significantly reduced as a result of the rise in overseas stock stocks in the context of the China-United States trade war.
According to the Agency ' s latest data, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$ 1.6 billion in July-September 2018, which was significantly lower than HK$ 61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$ 100 million in the second quarter of this year.
The President of the King's Administration, Chen Deok-hyun, stated in the Legislative Assembly that at the beginning of the Central American trade war, the Hong Kong and emerging market stock indices ran counter to the United States stock indices and that until late September and early October, when the United States stock market indices peaked, market sentiment began to reverse, as investors became aware of the adverse effects of the trade war on the United States itself.
“A change in market sentiment is a good thing, and if the trade war has only a one-sided impact, it will not help the solution.”
At the same time, he pointed out, “If the US-China trade war fails, the volatility of financial markets will continue to rise.”
In the third quarter of this year, the foreign exchange fund ' s equity investment deficit in Hong Kong was between 8 per cent and HK$4.7 billion, compared to the previous quarter, while the return on overseas stock investment increased significantly by HK$172 to HK$12.8 billion; the foreign exchange loss was HK$162 billion, and the bond earnings decreased by HK$9.7 billion, by 24 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively, by season, reflecting, inter alia, the general rise in the dollar against major currencies during the season and the three-point rise in the United States rate of fruits in mid-September.
Foreign exchange funds are mainly used to support the HK$.
Hong Kong has had a linkage exchange rate system of the Hong Kong dollar to the United States dollar since 1983.
With regard to the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Deok-hyun stated that while economic and asset market uncertainty had increased and downside risks had increased, the Hong Kong financial system was robust, defensive and earthquake-resistant.
“Hong Kong’s international investment position, with a net external asset value of $1.4 trillion equal to four times GDP, 2.5 times higher than Singapore’s and 0.6 times higher than Japan’s, is strong enough to cope with a downward or reversal of the economy.”
In a recent recovery of the HK dollar and an increase in the US dollar spread, Chen Dejong noted that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate had risen by more than 400 basis points on 21 September, and that the market was generally perceived to be largely related to the increase in the Hong Kong dollar, followed by the US dollar at a level around 7.80-7.84, and by the recent decline in the Hong Kong dollar and the widening of the margin with the United States dollar, could attract the market for the HK dollar and increase interest-saling activities in the US dollar, thus giving the Hong Kong dollar a greater chance than in the previous period of triggering a new exchange guarantee for weaker parties.
However, in his view, with the start of the Hong Kong Bank interest increase cycle and the normalization of Hong Kong dollar interest rates in progress, future Hong Kong dollar interest rates below the United States dollar rates will change.
“The trend in Hong Kong dollar and dollar interest rates will be more consistent, and more care must be taken to manage risks and prepare for market fluctuations.”
As a result of the abundance of HK$, Hong Kong dollar debundling fell further, from 0.9 per cent to 2.08179 per cent on Monday, three months of debundling, from 46 basis points to 51 basis points on the dollar, and from 120 basis points to 127 basis points on the dollar on the basis of a month ' s debundling.
From May to mid-September, the spot exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar approached 7.85 to the United States dollar for most of the time.
During this period, exchange assurances for weaker parties were triggered several times in May and August, following the first trigger in April, as a result of arbitrage activities and the outflow of some of the equity proceeds from Hong Kong dollars after the completion of the large-scale equity campaign.
The Authority purchased HK$ 7.85 at a level of 7.85 in accordance with the associated exchange rate regime and sold US dollars to maintain the exchange rate of the HK$.
The Authority purchased approximately HK$52.1 billion in May and August under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism.
Do the new tax laws offer advantages to people outside the country?
In response to a 30-day question from a journalist, the relevant head of the Department of Finance and the Department of Revenue indicated that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong and Macao.
Journalists have asked that the newly revised Personal Income Tax Act adjusts the criteria for the determination of our personal income tax residents from one full year to 183 days.
Are there any further preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong and Atota, in the next step in the implementation of the Act?
In response, the Officer-in-Charge stated that the implementing regulations of the current personal income tax law provide for special concessions for the taxation of persons outside China. Individuals who do not have residence in China but who have resided for more than one year or more than five years may pay only a portion of their personal income tax paid by a unit or individual in China.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new Personal Income Tax Act would be to consider continuing preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong and Macao.
There are no “threshold” monthly centres: quality certification leads to quality improvement.
With the growth of the “two-child economy” and the prosperity of the mother-child market, the city has grown from the north to the three-to-four-line cities, with the emergence of a variety of monstrosity centres.
The popular demand for consumption was met by the then hot Moon Club, with fees ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, but at the same time in an awkward position, an institution with so far no threshold and a gap in supervision.
A series of national “Quality Months” 2018 has recently been launched by the General Directorate of State Market Supervision, and journalists have come to a five-star moon centre in Tianjin City to visit the certification experience of mother and child care services.
The general lunar centres provide services such as neonatal care, nutritious meals, post-natal restoration of the plastic form, etc.
In this monthly centre, journalists observed that nurses check the breastfeeding of newborns on a daily basis, and professional caregivers provide intensive care services such as bathing and touching for newborns.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of the new mother, the mother was helped to regain her physical integrity by providing services such as early morning trauma care and post-medium amphibious care, as well as nursing programmes such as Chinese medicine and beauty treatment.
A new mother living in the house told the journalist that she had not been booked to the Moon's club until eight months earlier.
The services of the Moon House have a direct impact on the comfort and physical recovery of the mother during the period of the month. Some of the small Moon Clubs provide simple monthly services. There are health irregularities in disinfection, vulnerability to cross-infection, and a single unscientific diet, among other problems.
The head of the Moon Centre said that they were the only one of the five-star Moon Centre in Tianjin city to be certified as a B-class service.
“Although some clients did not initially understand the meaning of B-level certification, it was important for the long-term development of the enterprise to benefit the client by forcing the firm to adopt a rigorous, standardized process management through certification.” He said.
The Deputy Director-General of the Department of Accreditation and Supervision of the National Directorate-General of Market Supervision, Panreivin, said that service certification was a new certification system based on customer perception, concern for organizational quality management and the satisfaction of service characteristics, was an important component of the country ' s quality infrastructure and had a positive role in raising the share of quality service provision and enhancing the international competitiveness of Chinese services.
From 2004 onwards, after more than a decade of development, the service certification project has undergone a process of continuous and progressive development, with the emergence of a number of influential service certifications, such as financial service certification, certification of mother and child care services, certification of after-sales services, certification of e-commerce services, certification of health services, etc.
According to the General Directorate of State Market Supervision, there are currently more than 130 service certification bodies, more than 2,000 service certification officers and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates in the country.
Panreivin expressed the view that the development of service certification should be further guided and promoted by the gradual expansion of service certification coverage in the areas of health, education, sports, finance, electricity suppliers and the promotion of service supply side reform and quality improvement.
Reuter Hong Kong, 5 November - The Hong Kong building fell for two months in a row after it peaked. Chen Deok-hyun, President of the Hong Kong Financial Authority, stated on Monday that it would take time to observe whether the city had entered the downward cycle and, if confirmed, to consider a tightening policy of easing countercyclical measures at the appropriate time.
Chen Deok-yung added that, if the price of the building were to return, the first people to be affected would be those who were to be in business at the peak of the city, but the expected collapse in the prices of the building, as in the Asian financial storm of 1997, and the opportunity for citizens to cut prices significantly to sell their property would be much lower.
In a briefing to the Legislative Council, Chen Deok-hyun led a number of senior members of the Kim Bureau, who said that if it was confirmed that the city was entering a downward cycle, the measure could be eased at the appropriate time.
“However, it is still too early to relax when only a few weeks of data are seen to see whether the city is going down the cycle.”
Since October 2009, the Authority has so far introduced eight rounds of countercyclical measures to significantly tighten mortgages in various properties, including by reducing the number of mortgages, requiring mortgage applicants to pass rigorous pressure tests, etc., in order to enhance bank risk management and earthquake resilience.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest-raising cycle, the entire private residential building price index fell for two months in August-September, and the monthly decline increased to 1.44 per cent in September.
But the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of the year was 10.2%.
According to the Authority, the financial situation of households measuring their resilience to financial risks remains healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of households without mortgages in Hong Kong reached 66 per cent, up from an average of 60 per cent in 2009-11; the average number of mortgages in new mortgages and the ratio of contributions to revenue in new mortgages was 47 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively, significantly improved from 64 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, in 2009-11.
Chen Deok-yung, however, stated that high seismic resistance did not mean that the economy would not suffer from the downside, as property valuations would fall and those who bought buildings at the peak would bear the brunt.
Although the Authority tightens bank lending to mortgage lenders, mortgage borrowers can also obtain high-value mortgage lending through mortgage insurance or mortgage lending by developers.
Chen Deok-yung indicated that, together with mortgage lending to developers, borrowers now have a mortgage of 85-90 per cent, and if the price of the building falls by 10 per cent, negative assets (i.e. the market value of the property falls below the level of total outstanding mortgage loans).
However, the Vice-President of the Monetary Authority, Nguyen Guohe, noted that the authorities estimated that the total amount of mortgages provided by developers was only 2 - 2.5 per cent of the total amount of bank mortgages, which remained low.
At the peak of Hong Kong ' s negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, representing 22 per cent of the population.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive seasons.
On 1 October, Xinhua Xinhua, on 1 October, the E-Commerce Retail Exporters (Li Hongxia, Mawe) welcomed another wave of negative tax revenues, involving VAT, consumer tax exemptions, etc.
The Ministry of Finance, the National Directorate of Taxation, the Ministry of Commerce and the General Customs Department have recently issued a joint communication stating that the VAT, CAT tax exemption policy is to be implemented on a trial basis for exporting goods that are not supported by valid import certificates to electric power exporters in the integrated cross-border e-commerce pilot zone, provided that the following conditions are met.
First, e-commerce exporting enterprises are registered in the Comprehensive Test Zone and register export dates, goods names, unit of measure, quantity, unit price, amount on the platform of integrated services on the cross-border e-commerce line of the place of registration.
Second, export of goods is subject to electronic commerce export declarations through the customs offices of the locations of the Comprehensive Test Zone.
Third, the export goods do not belong to the Ministry of Finance and the Directorate-General of Taxes, pursuant to a decision of the State Council, and the export of goods for which the refund (exemption) of taxes is expressly cancelled.
It is clear from the circular that the General Customs Service regularly transmits electronic information on the E-Commerce Export Declaration List to the National Tax Administration.
The tax authorities of the CYPs strengthen the tax-exempt management of export goods on the basis of electronic information from the export declaration list, which is cleared by the National Tax Administration.
The circular states that specific tax exemptions are administered by the provincial tax administrations, the finance and commerce sectors.
The leadership teams and business authorities in the integrated pilot zones should coordinate and promote inter-sectoral collaboration and policy implementation, accelerate the establishment of a system for monitoring e-commerce export statistics and promote the rapid development of cross-border e-commerce.
A man in Liaoning province killed his lover and dumped his body, after which he fled to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
On 5 May, the journalist was informed by the Public Security Bureau of the East Victory District of Ordos, Inner Mongolia, that the man had been successfully captured following a joint police investigation between the two regions.
On 26 June 2018, a female disappeared in the city of Khamsan, Liaoning province, and her family called the local police.
As a result of a police investigation, it was not a simple case of disappearance, and the missing person was at high risk of being killed by a lover's house, and the police set up a special unit for further investigation.
On 30 October, the Task Force found out that the suspect Wang may have been hiding in the East Victory District of the city of Ordos, and immediately organized a strong police force to cooperate fully with the Liaoning police in the detection of the case.
After five days of reconnaissance, the civilian police finally figured out the location of Wang Yi and detailed their associates.
On 4 November, the two police forces joined forces to capture the suspect, Wang, at an excavator fittings shop in East Victory.
According to Wang, he had a relationship with the victim, a white lover, and because the sister had a large sum of money held under a white name, both decided to take it for themselves.
On 22 June 2018, as a result of a disagreement between Wang and Paik over the disposition of the funds, Wang went on to kill White in the rented house and to dump the body.
At present, the suspect Wang has been handed over to the Liaoning Hill Police.
"Green Development in Action" of the "Five Developments, Good Emblems"
The second column of the "Five Developments, Better Emblems" — the "Green Development in Action" — was officially launched on 5th.
In order to provide a comprehensive picture of the remarkable results of the construction of the Five Developments and Better Emblems, the Acid City Orbital Corporation, in collaboration with the Golden Python Media and Technology Corporation, designed a series of trains on the theme "Five Developments and Better Apocalypse".
Among them, the first train — the “Innovation in Action” — became operational on 1 October on the first track of Orbital Transport No. 1 in Homogene City.
The theme train on the line selected the blue green modulus, the symbol of mountain water, to reflect the birth engine, the vitality and the sense of purity.
The campaign highlighted the concept of the “Five Developments: A Better Emblem” core and 18 representative examples of green development outcomes in the province, including the development of green development priorities such as the Jianghua Canal Project, the Long Forest System, the Yangtze Economic Zone Conservation Development, and the Ten Million Acre Forest Growth Project.
In addition, the “Coordination of development in action”, “Open development in action” and “Shared development in action” trains will also be on the line in the near future.
On October 1, the first day of the "gold Week" in the Mainland, and the last day of the Hong Kong National Day public holiday, many residents of the Mainland took advantage of the holidays to travel, shop, and many Hong Kong residents returned to Hong Kong on that day, and there was a flow of “blast sheds” at the Shenzhen ports. Twenty-two self-help passages were opened at the Lake Lo and Shenzhen Bay crossings to improve port clearance efficiency and facilitate efficient and expeditious clearance of passengers.
According to data from the Shenzhen border control station, at 1600 hours the same day, the Shenzhen crossing had more than 429,000 departures and departures, the number of transport vehicles had reached more than 168,000 (ships, racks, columns), and the ports remained busy and maintained a good order of entry and exit.
A number of positive factors, such as the increase in the number of countries offering exit and exemption policies to Chinese citizens, are known to have led to a steady increase in the number of passengers taking vacations and shopping to countries such as Europe and South-East Asia on national holidays.
In the early morning of the first day of the year, the crossings of Lake Ro, Shenzhen Bay, Wang Guo and Fukuda reached a peak in the flow of passengers, which lasted from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., and the Shenzhen crossing from 6.30 a.m. to 13 p.m.
It was reported that, in response to the peak flow of incoming and outgoing passengers (cars), the Shenzhen border General Inspectorate station was deployed in accordance with the National Immigration Administration in a unified manner, initiating the passenger (car) rush hour operating pattern, arranging overtime police to support the first line of duty, opening advance foot-checking routes, directing passengers and vehicles to ensure that Chinese citizens ' entry and exit customs clearance queues do not exceed 30 minutes, taking into account the efficiency of customs clearance for foreigners, and strengthening the maintenance of order in high-flow areas and ensuring the safe and orderly passage of customs.
The Shenzhen General Inspectorate also reminds incoming and outgoing passengers to be aware of the validity of their documents and visas and of the validity of their signatures before travelling, to make reasonable arrangements for travel, to avoid the peak hours of the flow as much as possible, and to choose the right time and the right port of exit.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong by high railway in Hiroshima are required to carry valid entry/exit documents and a visa sign, with high-speed tickets only issued by car, and cannot be used as an entry/exit document. If they are unable to leave Hong Kong due to, inter alia, non-compliance with documentation procedures, they must follow the guidelines of the Border Guard and wait to be brought to a designated place by the staff of the Hong Kong Railway Company to undergo the driving procedures to return to the Mainland.
Systematic haemorrhagic ailments, which were considered to be “irrepair” in the past, are a chronic syndrome of fatigue and a multiplicity of organs throughout the body.
The lack of effective treatment prevents treatment because of the lack of clear mechanisms for its occurrence, the difficulties of diagnosis and treatment.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the Faculty of Life Sciences of Qinghua University, and the United Group of Chewie National Centers at the People ' s Hospital, Beijing University, discovered the presence of human immunoglobin and its involvement in the regulation of immune B cells, which increases the susceptibility of systemic red-coupled lupus.
In short, both teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body was a major cause of systemic haemorrhagic disease.
According to one of the authors of the article, Sun Xiaojun of the Greater North People ' s Hospital, the Chestnut Nation team collected and studied nearly 2,000 cases of systematic haemorrhagic haemorrhagic ailments and found that patients with immunoglobin mutation produced a wide range of their own antibodies, and that the incidence and severity of inflammatory conditions, such as nephritis, arthritis, mammonia, vascularitis, etc., had increased significantly.
The Liu Wanli team, through various research methods such as immunocytes, animal experiments, sequencing, etc., discovered this immune signal route activated by immuno-molecular mutation, as well as the pathogenic mechanisms that promote the secretion of B cells from multiple self-resistant bodies.
Journalists learned that the two teams were strong and united, taking full advantage of their respective strengths and bringing basic research and clinical applications closer together.
The Liu Wanli team is working on the Blymphocyte immuno-immunisation study, while the Chestnut Nation team is engaged in a long-term clinical study of systematic red-coupled lupus.
“The study was one of the results of years of collaboration between the two teams, and it was the first time in the academic community that it was institutionally recognized that immunoglobin genetic anomalies would induce systemic haemorrhagic ailments, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeting.”
It is not a matter of protection, but of the law.
The lawyer brought the ax to court?
The news was indeed exciting at first sight, and it blew up the pot in the legal circle.
The Fujian Quan City Central Law subsequently fined the lawyers involved $500 and recommended in writing that the Quan Quan City Bar Association conduct an investigation.
According to the Newjing newspaper, the former Quan City Law Association issued an official circular stating that the conduct of the two lawyers did not involve violations of the law and was not punishable under the law.
According to multiple reports, the handling by the Quanzhou City Bar was not short-lived or confrontational, but was endorsed by the Quanzhou Middle Court.
An incident that could have triggered tensions within the legal community was finally properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete return of the truth: the axes carried by the lawyers involved are identical to the murder weapon of the accused, the same type, but unopened, supporting evidence only at the evidentiary level, with no intimidation or subjective intent “to endanger the safety of the court”.
There are four very important details to determine whether the lawyer ' s conduct was in violation of the law: first, the local court held two previous sessions, with only an ax photo showing, which, from the defence ' s point of view, was necessary; second, the ax was purchased only an hour before the opening of the trial, not because the lawyer was unwilling to seek the judge ' s consent, but objectively failed to reach the judge; third, the entire ax was not overstretched or improperly used; and fourth, the lawyer in question publicly acknowledged the error at the first time and apologized to the court.
Combining these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer involved “was present in court with an axe” was not involved in the offence, but merely in the defence.
After clarifying the facts, the City Council of Quan, instead of passing through the ship, took the decision without punishment in the face of pressure.
This decision, in turn, is subject to the test of fact and law.
As for bringing the ax to the court as a control knife without the court's permission, it is true that it can be a source of anxiety and misunderstanding.
For reasons of safety and caution, the previous fine and judicial recommendations of the Quanzhou Central Court are also worthy of consideration.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers and to prevent individual courts from making it difficult for lawyers, the Supreme Law issued in 2014 the Rules on Security Inspection of the Judicial Police of the People ' s Courts, which establishes the principle that lawyers are not required to carry out physical security checks before a court.
Since the issuance of the rule, a wide range of lawyers have led by example, with few incidents that endanger the safety of the Tribunal as a result of security loopholes.
In very isolated cases such as the one in Quanzhou, it is not difficult to dispel misunderstandings as long as communication is conducted in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
The Bar Association, as a self-regulating organization of the bar profession, has a dual mandate of punishing wrongful acts and guaranteeing legality.
In the past, IAJOs suffered from severe illness due to their bias towards discipline and lack of security.
The decisions of the Quan State Bar, both in terms of process and outcome, are commendable and serve as an example for more members of the Bar to perform their duties properly.
From October 1st, which tax revenues will affect our money bags?
The Xinhua Society's new personal income tax law of 1 October 2010 in Shanghai (journalist Sanju) will come into effect on 1 January 2019. In order for the public to benefit from the tax deduction dividend as soon as possible, the tax revenues actually earned by taxpayers will be deducted from 1 October at the starting point of $5,000 per month, and a new tax scale will be applied.
With the New Deal, what are the benefits of the money bags that affect the masses?
Good one: significant tax deductions from wages and salaries
Taxpayers who receive wages after 1 October can deduct the basic deduction of $5,000/month and apply the new tax scale. Most taxpayers have different degrees of tax deductions, especially for low- and middle-income persons.
According to the tax reduction table for the different income groups, the monthly income after the deduction of the “triple risk” amounts to $8,000, $10,000, $20,000 and $50,000. The tax adjustment amounts to $90, 290, 1590 and $9090 respectively. The corresponding rates of tax deductions are 73.9 per cent, 61.1 per cent, 49.0 per cent and 18.8 per cent, respectively, compared with the starting point of $350 per cent.
It is worth noting that, for the purpose of holiday holidays, the salaries that were to have been paid by law in October at the end of September are subject to a new basic scale of deductions and tax rates.
To this end, the collected client software, which the tax authorities have consistently promoted, has provided the corresponding tax calculation functionality, but the corresponding taxes still have to be reported for payment within the statutory filing period.
Good two: the low tax brackets are significantly larger.
In addition to raising the point of origin, a new tax scale will be applied as of 1 October.
There has been no change in the current payroll, the seven tranches of the payroll, the same rate as before, but there has been a marked change in the tariff range, with 3%, 10%, and 20% of the three series of low rates increasing significantly, while 25% of the rate has been reduced, while 30%, 35%, and 45% of the three series of higher rates have remained unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax code also adjusts the tax rates earned from production operations, with the threshold of 35 per cent of the ceiling being raised from $100,000 to $500,000.
This means that both individual business owners and individual sole-sourced partnerships will benefit from tax changes.
“As far as previous tax cuts on individual taxpayers in Shanghai are concerned, the dividends of individual tax reforms will be fully felt by a wide range of taxpayers, especially among low- and middle-income people.”
The head of the personal income tax division of the Shanghai Municipal Revenue Service of the National Tax Administration, Ramin, stated that
Three benefits: tax services are easier and better optimized
Since the promulgation of the new Personal Income Tax Act, the tax authorities of Shanghai City have carried out a series of comprehensive and wide-ranging tax campaigns.
On the one hand, “one-on-one, one-point” policy advice is provided to priority tax sources and priority enterprises.
The Pudong New District Revenue Authority has visited large enterprises, such as Apple Trading (Shanghai) Ltd., Payment Bo (China) Network Technology Co. Ltd., and the Red Star Mekyllon Family Group, Inc., which have large numbers of employees, large surrogate payments, large tax payments, voluntary mentoring by the tax authorities, questions and answers; the Xu Hing District Revenue Authority has visited the large labour enterprises in the region, the Intelligence and Finance Consulting Company Ltd., the China-China Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Corporation, etc., to collect business concerns in a timely manner, respond to business demands and resolve business difficulties.
On the other hand, a tax policy of “fullness, multidimensionality and stereotypicity” is implemented for the general public taxpayers.
The timely delivery of policy hot spots through the Shanghai official tax website, the Weibo Public, Weibo, etc. to ensure that policy advocacy is in place.
At the same time, on 28 September, the Shanghai Tax Micro-Trust Public Online Smart Counselling Platform 12366 launched the “Target-to-Small” Smart Integrated Tax Reform Advocacy Service through the “Man + Smart” Tax Service Counselling.

"The King of the Crabs" is known for its lack of mud, its common name, "Crabs of the Clear Water" and its white bellies, as well as its venom.
The fragrance of cinnamon's golden autumn crabs has become a customary practice.
The big gate crabs are the most well-known image spokesperson of the city.
Crab shells, crab-sucking feet, crab-picking, crab-picking, food-eaters feel the beauty of being in the south of the country.
Crab farmers, Kim Wei, introduced the fact that more people will spend more time in Bar City this year, by the silhouette lake, by the smoke, by the white aphids, by the sun, by the fun of catching crabs, and by the slow pace of water.
As a result of the widespread introduction of large-scale seedlings in the towns and cities of Palestine, this year ' s floodgate crabs are much larger than in the past.
The crab farmer, who has been dealing with crabs for almost 20 years, is planning to export to Thailand the crab seedlings and breeding techniques of the cypressed lake crabs, allowing the water and water to eat across national borders and promoting cultural exchanges with the overseas cuisine.
The town of Quinque is a cultural sign of the city.
At present, there are 1300 hotels and restaurants with crabs, fisher's lights, spring and autumn water, lake crabs, five major crab markets and edible foods on the market of Jeopardy crabs, and a unique landscape with cypressed crabs.
Guewenhua described the “One Crab” as a source of nearly 3 million visitors per year, both within and outside the sea, and as a two-way, lively and fragrant old street of Ba.

The Trilateral Trade Agreement between the United States of America and the United States of America will bring new opportunities to 500 million people.
According to external media reports, a joint statement by Foreign Minister Freeland of Canada and United States Trade Representative Letheze, published on the Canadian Government's website, stated that the United States, Canada and Mexico had entered into a tripartite trade agreement, which would be known as the “USMCA” (the “Mega Trinational Agreement”).
Previously, CTV News, Canada, quoted senior sources from the United States as saying that Canada and the United States had overcome their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post quoted two sources of information who reported that the agreement reached on 30 September between the United States and Canada would retain the North American Free Trade Agreement as a tripartite trade agreement and that the three heads of State would sign a new agreement within two months.
“Today, Canada, the United States, and Mexico have agreed on a new trade agreement – the USMCA – which will provide our workers, farmers, and companies with a high standard of trade agreement, which will lead to freer markets, fairer transactions, and more sustainable economic growth. The agreement will strengthen the middle class, create high-paying jobs, and create new opportunities for about 500 million people.”
According to the information received, the existing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed in 1994 by the United States, Mexico and Canada.
Following the inauguration of the President, Trump announced plans to reconsider the agreement and sign a new agreement.
The three countries started the negotiation process in 2017.
The Okinawa Governor's election, which was held in advance of the death of the former Governor, Yukio Yoo, was announced in the early morning of 1 local time, with the successful election of Danny Tam City, who opposed the relocation plan of the United States military base in Japan.
The final results of the vote cast on 30 September showed that Tam City had obtained 396,632,000 votes, the highest in the history of the Okinawa Presbyterian election, and that there were more than 80,000 votes more than the main contestant, Jun Xu Xi Jin.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24 per cent, a decrease of 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 Okinawa Prefectural Election.
On 1 January, Tam City informed the media that the results of the election showed that the people of the county did not want the efforts of the Governor to be wasted before he died, that he would continue to work with the Governments of Japan and the United States against the relocation of the United States military base and the closure of the Panchaun base, among other things.
The U.S. military base, located in Ieno Bay, Okinawa County, has been plagued by a long-standing disease, and the Japanese and American Government had previously agreed to relocate it to the marginal field of the city of Nobu, but the people of Okinawa were strongly opposed to the complete relocation of the base out of Okinawa.
On the other hand, with regard to the relocation plan, which was strongly opposed by the prefects, and the withdrawal of the land-filling permit on the coast, the city stated that it had not been in opposition to and divided with the central Government at the outset, and that it was hoped that the two sides would have a full exchange of views that would demonstrate their intention to reach a negotiated settlement.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also expressed to the media in the morning that he took this outcome seriously and that he would make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and ease the burden on the base.
At a press conference on 1 January, Japan's Chief of Staff, Jao Yi Wei, stated that the Government's approach to moving United States military bases as soon as possible had not changed.
At the same time, he expressed his intention to meet with the city.
Tam City will assume its official functions as Okinawa County Governor on 4 this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oilseeds grew, Paul Thomas, a farmer from North Dakota State in the United States, has grown more soybeans in his land.
This shift reached its peak this year, with 1,600 acres of soybeans planted in 5,000 acres, on an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and a lot of farmers like him plan to turn in 2019 to the former American agricultural areas of staple food crops: maize and wheat.
This year, farmers in the United States cultivated soybean more than maize, for the first time in 35 years.
The planned conversion of other food crops was due to the difficulties faced by American farmers in selling soybeans in the context of the trade war launched by United States President Trump against China.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of United States exports of soybeans, but in recent months, as a result of the trade war, almost no United States soybeans have been purchased, resulting in soybean prices falling to a decade low.
Thomas intends to grow more wheat next year, hoping to earn more by reducing dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Thomas said the soybean price “has brought us a painful blow”.
He stated that, without China ' s purchases, the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per burrow, while the price necessary to cover the cost was $8.50.
This year, farmers in the United States recorded a record high in soybean cultivation and a record high in harvest.
At such a time of vulnerability, they were hit by a trade war.
In July, China imposed customs duties on imports of soybeans from the United States in response to Trump's imposition of additional tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.
The United States Department of Agriculture will issue its first estimate of the area to be cultivated next year, which will include consideration of tariff implications.
This estimate is expected to confirm the expected reduction in soybean soybean soybean cultivation by private institutions.
According to a report by Reuters, on 19 October Informa Economics projected an increase of 4 to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in maize cultivation in 2019 and a decrease of 7 to 83 million acres in soybean cultivation.
Informa also expects a 4% increase in wheat cultivation in the United States.
The area of soybean planted prior to the imposition of retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, some 15 million acres higher than 10 years ago.
The area under maize cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008, to 89.1 million acres, and this year the area under wheat cultivation is 47.8 million acres, the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, the head of the corn plantation association of Illinois, has a total area of 3,600 acres under his own cultivation, and this year nearly half of him is used for soybean cultivation, but it is planned to reduce it in the future.
He claims that it may be possible to increase maize cultivation by up to 20 per cent on his farm in northern Illinois, the largest soybean State in the United States.
Soybeans produce less than maize per acre but require less fertilizer, which makes soybean cultivation generally less costly.
The transfer of farmers to final maize may raise costs but will benefit a number of enterprises, including Andersons Inc. Fertilizers.
Executive Director Pat Bowe of Andersons stated to Reuters that he expected that the conversion of maize would be beneficial to fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the conversion of farmers to maize.
The Director-General of the Luongman Airport Administration of Bangkok, Sutilawa, Thailand, held a press conference on 29 September to apologize for the beating of a Chinese citizen at the airport and to say that Thailand welcomed Chinese tourists and that the authorities would strengthen their management, raise awareness of services and avoid similar incidents.
It was reported that, on 27 June, security guards at the airport of Sunman had physically clashed with a Chinese man who had been denied entry into the country.
Sutilawa stated that the security guard had committed serious misconduct and had been suspended from duty by the Airports Authority, and that a Board of Inquiry had been established to investigate the matter in accordance with the procedure, and that the security guard would be dismissed if the facts were correct.
The Thai Immigration Service has now arranged for the man to return to China by air.
Sutilawa apologized for this incident, which tarnished the image of Thailand, and said that the Thai side attached great importance to the matter, was willing to do its utmost to mitigate the impact of the incident on the tourists who had been beaten, and would send a letter of apology to the person concerned through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that the airport was willing to facilitate Chinese tourists to Thailand and that the Thai Immigration Service had established special access routes for Chinese tourists at the five main Thai international airports in Suwanapur, Sunman, Chiang Mai, Puji and Yi'ay, Bangkok.
The next step, he said, would be for the Airport Authority to overhaul the area of the site sign-off, to indicate the cost of the sign-off, and to improve the quality of services and communication capacity of the staff.
When the Chinese Embassy in Thailand became aware of the incident, the first contact was made with the person concerned to learn what had happened.
At the same time, the Head of the Thai Immigration Service, the Airports Authority and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports made representations to the Thai side to thoroughly investigate the incident and severely punish the perpetrators, and will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side in order to properly deal with the matter and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the persons concerned.
Xinhua International Times Review: To defend multilateralism, China is one and the same.
The international rules and the multilateral order were being shaken at a time when unilateralism was inflaming.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible Power, China has joined the international community in upholding multilateralism and promoting it as it continues to move forward, in keeping with the greatness of the country and the ideals of the United Nations.
Faced with the new challenges of the new situation, China has made a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As the State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi said in his address to the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should be based on a cooperative win-win approach, based on a rule-based order, based on equity and justice and guided by effective action.
At the same time, China called for a global development cooperation architecture complemented by the United Nations and North-South cooperation, and South-South cooperation, and called on all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As President Espinosa of the 73rd session of the General Assembly said, in the present situation, “the United Nations needs, more than ever, to promote multilateralism and uphold a rules-based international system”.
The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Lagarde, said that the international community should remain steadfast in upholding the multilateral trading system, upholding the rules of international trade and resolving differences through consultations.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the political power of the global economy, a number of emerging markets and groups of developing countries have emerged to play a greater role in the main international multilateral mechanisms and to provide a new dynamic for the development of counter-winding multilateralism.
Standing on this scale, China ' s advocacy of building a large family, rather than collating small circles, adhering to the idea of multilateralism, such as co-constructing rather than winning, is an inescapable choice to meet global challenges and solve the world ' s problems, representing the common claim of most of the world ' s countries.
There are advanced ideas and more solid actions.
China's “one-way” initiative had become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China's international and regional cooperation initiatives, such as the one-way construction initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the 16+1 Cooperation, promote international regional cooperation, complement existing international regimes and order, bring new dynamism to multilateral cooperation and contribute to the development of a more just and equitable international order.
As the guardian of the international order and the implementer of multilateralism, China ' s actions have grown stronger in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices in international hot spots, combating climate change, participation in peacekeeping operations, strong efforts to reduce poverty and reduce poverty, and contributions to the implementation of the 2030 sustainable development agenda by other countries.
As the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the “trust deficit” facing the world is exacerbated and populism and polarization are on the rise, it is at a time when the world's need for multilateral cooperation is most pressing.
At such a historic juncture, the international community needs to work together to translate consensus into action, to firmly defend multilateralism and to work together to build a community of human destinies.
On 30 September, the first national standard 4K demonstration zone in Guangdong, Guangzhou, was unveiled in the Jinjin Garden area of Haeju District in Guangzhou City. On that day, the 4K operation of the Guangdong electricity network was officially launched in Guangdong Province, and the ceremony of the 4K super-highlight channel of the Central Radio and Television Station, Guangdong Province, was held in parallel.
The event was co-sponsored by the Guangdong Cable Radio and Television Network Ltd. and the co-building co-management and shared social governance leadership group in the Great Pond area of the Haiju region.
According to the deployment of the Guangdong provincial government, the Guangdong Hiroshima Power Network actively implemented the 4K Action Plan for the new digital family. In December 2017, the first new digital family demonstration area in the country, marked by 4K-based video, next-generation Internet, cable-wire integration network applications, was launched. The new digital family gateway end product, the "U-point family server " , was launched with the AVS2 standard 4K box, telescope, and actively participated in the construction of the 4K television network application demonstration area in Guangdong province.
In 2018, the Guangdong Wide Power Network launched a series of wide-power initiatives for the benefit of the people, and launched the “4K Service Month” to promote the full range of “U Point Family Servers” throughout the province.
On the same day, the 4K Operation of the Guangdong Hiroshima Power Network was officially launched throughout the province, and the first 4K Smart Television Home Sharing Platform, based on the 4K application, was officially launched in parallel with the launch of the 4K-based project, which was jointly developed by the Co-Governance Social Governance Leadership Group Office of the Guangdong Clan and the Great Pond area of the Haiju District. The platform project is based on the 4K U-point Family Server of the Toguang Dong Power Network, the realization of a new generation of intelligent family services based on the cable television network, and the integration of government-related pro-people services, with the aim of providing citizens with a television sharing platform that integrates public information, education, pro-people, pro-people, entertainment and other services.
Chen Xiaoging, Chief Engineer, Press and Publications, Guangdong Province, stated at the event that the event was a useful collaboration for the work of the Government Centre of the Party's Committee for Active Services of the Wireless Network, the Government's active use of “Internet+” to create a “digital government” for the benefit of the population, in the hope that, through cooperation and outreach, the Guangdong Wide Power Network would contribute to the development of a common and shared social governance model for the Hae-ju region, Guangzhou and the province as a whole.
A new digital family application, with 4K TV at its core, was shown and made widely available at the ceremony.
The first edition of the 4K Smart TV Home-to-House platform will feature four major modules: the Guangzhou neighbourhood, the New Guangzhou Man's House, the Smart Community and the Wise Family, which will focus on the development of intelligent neighbourhoods.
According to the information received, the Guangdong wide power network now operates five 4K live channels and, on the occasion of the National Day, the central radio and television main station, 4K ultra-high-resolution channels, will be broadcast exclusively throughout the province.
The report reads as follows: 30 September is the fifth national anniversary of martyrs.
At 10 a.m. on the same day, the Xi Near Equality Party and national leaders, together with representatives from all walks of life in the capital, attended a ceremony to pay tribute to the people ' s heroes and to honour their martyrs.
A quick review of the situation: this is the first anniversary of our heroic martyr protection.
Five years ago, on the eve of the National Day of Remembrance of the Martyrs, the great journey of the Chinese nation from misery to glory was marked by a constant wake-up call: “Where we come from, where we go”.
Secretary-General Xi’s profound observation is that “the abandonment of tradition, the abandonment of which is tantamount to the cutting of your own soulline.”
“The future can only be opened by remembering history.”
Our heroism, our remembrance of the martyrs, is to forever remember history, to renew our spirit and to rally the strong and positive energy of national renaissance.
Quite quickly, the English are the backbone of the nation.
The reverence of the martyrs, the commemoration of the martyrs, is to make the high, holy and powerful eternal memory of our hearts and minds.
According to incomplete statistics, some 20 million martyrs have died heroically for national independence, for the liberation of the people and for the country ' s prosperity and well-being.
Every sacrifice for his country will be remembered, and the spirit of every faithful nation will be looked upon.
The establishment of national days for them, as well as the organization of various forms of observance, is intended to pay tribute to them in the name of their country, to pay deep tribute to their great service and to learn the precious spirit of their love for their homeland, loyalty to their people, selflessness and sacrifice.
The Government of the Party Committees at all levels has improved the system of preferential treatment and continuously raised the level of pension treatment, and the Party and the State have practiced the honour of heroes with practical action.
Every year, countless people look to the martyr's mausoleum, so that we feel the deep feelings of popular remembrance and the momentum for recovery that has been raised in the blood of the nation.
The celebration of heroes, the defence of heroes, the learning of heroes, the love of heroes are the norm in society as a whole.
Quick to conclude, in today's new era of socialism in China's identity, we can tell the enthusiasts that a powerful China is rising in the East, and the Chinese dream of the great renaissance of the Chinese nation is turning into reality in our hands.
Let's move forward with a spirit of greatness and greatness!

The fifth Disability Voice Month is coming to focus on sexuality education for young people with disabilities.
In recent years, the subject of sexual education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge for disabled adolescents remains daunting.
Recently, a workshop on challenges and strategies for comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities was held in Beijing.
Sexual education for children and young people with disabilities was an important topic of the seminar.
The report on sexual-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of disabled children and young people in China, published at the conference, showed that disabled children suffer from a higher proportion of sexual harassment and abuse than healthy children.
Social attention to disabled children and adolescents is also “sexually protected”.
The purpose of the seminar was to explore the promotion of comprehensive sexuality education for children and adolescents with disabilities in China, from the point of view of family support, school education and institutional services, to provide support to children and adolescents with disabilities from the source and to enable them to enjoy their right to love on an equal footing with others.
According to the experts, the awareness of the general public of the disabled in Chinese society has been at an inadequate level.
China ' s comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities, especially children and adolescents, is not sufficiently advanced, as a result of such factors as traditional attitudes.
In recent years, however, with the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the public good, there has been a welcome development in the full cycle of development of sexual and reproductive health education practices and pathways for persons with disabilities in China.
The Report shows that children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical disabilities, while having some difficulties in accessing sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships, have generally moved towards ease and enrichment.
The Seminar on the Challenges and Practical Strategies of Comprehensive Sexual Education for People with Disabilities, sponsored by the Shanghai Humanities Foundation and co-sponsored by UNESCO's Representative Office in China, the International Disability Alliance in Beijing (France) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in China, aims, in the context of a broad strategy for healthy China, to explore ways and means of developing sexual and reproductive health education practices and practices for the full cycle of comprehensive development of persons with disabilities, and to promote awareness among stakeholders in the field of special education and integration of education, educators, researchers, social service organizations, parents' representatives, among others, of the international policy of comprehensive sexual education and the right to health of children and young people with disabilities; to engage in a broad exchange of sexual education practices, strategies, challenges and resources for children and young people with disabilities in the country, to discuss and develop a blueprint for future comprehensive sexual education for children with disabilities and young people, and to form a support network.
Reuter Beijing, 30 September - The Central Bank of China announced on Sunday its data on the projected short-term outflows of foreign currency assets, showing that, as of the end of August of this year, the Bank’s foreign currency’s forward and futures contracts had been empty for 12 months, and that there were still no positions in that month.
According to the central bank ' s previous data, as of the end of August last year, the central bank held a total of $6,044 billion, the fourth consecutive month, in vacant positions in foreign currency forward and futures contracts; the size of the empty position, denominated in SDRs (special drawing rights), was 4,276 million SDRs.
Since then, the central bank ' s foreign exchange forward position has been zero.
The central bank released the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; the data show that, at the end of February 2016, the foreign currency of the central bank had a multi-position of $2,438 million in forward and futures contracts and $28.9 billion in empty positions.
For the first time, the September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net increase of $16,401 million to $45,301 million.
The Central Bank has previously stated that the forward and futures empty position of foreign currency vis-à-vis this currency largely reflects its foreign exchange forward operations with commercial banks to meet the demand for hedging of corporate foreign currency liabilities, which will continue to provide long-term risk avoidance products on a demand-driven basis, with less impact on the size of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of 20 September this year, on the K158 train, Joe, a senior student in Chengzhou, took the car to the crane wall.
One of the masters on the train bought a ticket without a seat, but took her seat: " Shoot it."
Two hours away, the train captain persuaded him to remain ineffective for an hour.
Eventually, a male passenger in the same car couldn't look down and pull him up.
On the other hand, while the result is mostly public condemnation, administrative punishment by the public security services, and even the blacklist of good faith, the public still feels that it is not “free of hatred”: why not let the hegemonics be punished on the spot?
Why can't they be punished in the first place, instead of immediately preventing their immoral and even unlawful behaviour?
And how can a man's passenger be held up for the unreasonable conduct of the Grand Priest?
This is mainly due to the fact that only long-distance trains are equipped with police and that short-distance trains are not generally available, and even when they are available, they tend to worry about the possible rogue reaction of the hegemonics rather than taking coercive removal measures.
Repeated hegemonic incidents have brought to the fore the need to allow the hegemonics to be forcibly removed from the scene and even punished in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires that our trains take robust and timely measures, and that the non-police trains be deployed as soon as possible in order to ensure that violations are stopped and combated in a timely manner.
On 1 October, on the first day of the national holiday, there was a surge of vehicles in the direction of Songpan, Mau County, via the Sichuan-North Trunchuan Autonomous District.
At around 1300 hours, a call for help was made to the Niekawa traffic police saying that their family had been in a traffic accident in Songpan and that, owing to the limited medical conditions in the area, there was an urgent need to send them to Mianyang for treatment.
A single-way traffic control of the Lake Tungjiang road is in place, and the traffic police are requested to release the 120 first aid vehicles.
Upon receipt of a call for help, the civilian police on duty promptly reported the situation to the brigade and immediately after Captain Huang Xuemin was briefed, arranged for the civilian police on duty at the control point to contact the caller and demanded that the escort be carried out in full.
“There were more than a thousand vehicles entering the control section at that time, and, after contacting the 120 emergency vehicle, it is expected that the time of arrival in Kitagawa will be around 1500 hours, and we will immediately arrange for their deployment.”
In order to prevent the double rows of vehicles that have entered the road in parallel, the traffic police imposed a partial control of the vehicle one hour in advance at the beginning, centre and end of the road at three points, and reminded all passing drivers to leave the road on the side of the road and to miscarry for the emergency vehicle.
Subsequently, the drum squadron of civilian police also suspended their vehicles from entering the control section and queued for the 120 emergency vehicles that were about to arrive.
At 1500 hours, an ambulance with a Kawakami U licence plate entered the territory of Kitagawa and a police car was sent by the police to escort the ambulance back into the control section.
It is understood that only one vehicle is available in some areas of the road around the lake, and that the civilian police carried out early temporary control of those areas, ensuring the smooth passage of the 120 emergency vehicles.
Upon arrival at the 10-mile pillar village in the gyre, there was a road that could not be wrongly ceded, so the traffic police contacted the village councils in advance, borrowed the village bypass and banned social vehicles from entering the village.
“it took only 40 minutes to get a 120 emergency vehicle from the Kitagawa traffic police to the normal road to 302 provincial road.”
Wei's presentation said that, as a rule, the entire passage took four hours.
“This arrangement has successfully secured valuable treatment time for the patient.”
At 1720 hours, the patients at risk were said to have arrived in Mianyang in time for treatment.
The number of confirmed deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose rapidly to 832 and the authorities fear that this number will rise, as relief workers have difficulty in providing assistance to remote and inaccessible areas.
Of particular concern is the fact that the population of this area, north of Baru, is 300,000, close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Two other areas have lost contact with the outside world since Friday.
“We have not yet received reports from the other three regions.”
Communications and electricity continued to be disrupted.
Nugroho indicated that the missing persons included five foreigners, three of whom were French, one Korean and one Malaysian.
The earthquake and tsunami killed 832 people.
According to Vice-President Kara of Indonesia, the death toll is likely to rise to thousands.
Earlier, Indonesian President Zorko-Vidodo had surveyed the affected areas and called on the population to endure.
Reuters, 4 November - The British Daily Telegraph Sunday reported that British Secretary of State for Europe, Dominic Raab, had privately requested Britain's right to “safe” the Irish border after three months.
Rabb was reported to have made this request to Simon Coveney, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland, at a private meeting in London last Tuesday.

Yesterday morning, at 8.05 a.m., two suspected pick-ups were arrested while the 20th bus was stealing from the 20th bus station, Permanent Gate, to the entrance of Pearl City.
Two of the men who stole the passenger ' s jacket and pocket were cut, and 800 dollars of the cash was stolen, leading to the capture of the civilian police who were already standing by.
This was the first case of theft uncovered by the Beijing police during the National Day.
Yesterday, at around 5 a.m., the counter-prosecution officers of the Beijing Public Security Mobile Investigation Brigade arrived at their intended positions.
According to past experience, places where human flows are concentrated, public transport hubs, public transport subway lines, including the watchers of Tiananmen Square, are the focus of their work.
In the human flow, civilian plainclothes police watched the passers-by calmly.
At more than 7 a.m., two suspicious men were found by the investigators who were at the bus station, following a male passenger on a 20-way bus from the Yongding gate.
In the car, two suspicious men, one left and one right, caught the male passenger in the middle, one of whom tried to cover the other.
They did not know, however, that their actions were already in the eyes of civilian plainclothes officers who were watching.
“Kidnapping of thieves”, the plain-clothes civilian police caught people on fire, and while waiting for a man to commit a theft, the police looked at the men who were ready to steal, and were caught by the investigators as soon as they were able to steal.
A reporter from the Beijing Morning News observed that the civilian police had seized $800 in cash from suspects of theft.
"They took the money out of the passenger's pocket."
The civilian police, pointing to a broken jacket pocket, said, “They cut the place open, stole $800 from a tourist who came to Kyoto, and when we caught them, the money was just loaded into their own pockets.”
The journalist learned that, in order to capture the two men, the plainclothes civilian police followed him for an hour and finally caught him at the time of his crime.
Two suspects are currently under police scrutiny.
In plain clothes, the civilian police told journalists who was suspicious in the crowd, a problem that was simple for the civilian police.
“The more thieves are caught, the more their eyes, the more their look, the more their look and the more ordinary their passengers are, the more they look at people’s pockets and backpacks, the more they like to drill into the crowd, the less they run away from people.”
The civilian police also told journalists that suspects often wait for vehicles to be purposeless and like to wander around the station and find the target of the theft before following the car.
"These are the words of experience. We've been working in plain clothes for a long time, and we'll see."
In addition, the civilian police warned that “the most convenient and easy to steal is to hide.”
Take care of your belongings while travelling in the car, in case of theft.

This newspaper (internship journalist Li Quan) has in recent years witnessed numerous incidents of incompetence of the school plastic runway.
To this end, the Ministry of Education has issued a circular requiring the implementation of the new national logo at the complex surface sports site for synthetic materials in primary and secondary schools to be delivered after 1 November of this year.
The mandatory national standard, " Grounds for Polysynthetic Sports in Primary and Secondary Schools " , was organized by the Ministry of Education, with the participation of 26 scientific institutes and testing agencies, and was revised over two years, during which more than 100 expert meetings were organized, as well as field visits and sampling tests nationwide, which collected numerous testing experiments on hundreds of enterprise products on the market.
In contrast to the 2005 old national markers, journalists found that the new country marker not only changed from a “national recommended standard” to a “national mandatory standard”, but also added a number of elements, including thickness requirements, physical performance, aging properties, inorganic filling content requirements, requirements for high concentration of anti-sliding granules, limits on the amount of hazardous substances from surface finished products, and limits on the amount of hazardous substances from non-solid and solid raw materials.
In particular, the new flag limits the amount of hazardous substances that may result from the construction of the school plastic runway, from 7 to 18, and regulates the amount of volatile organic material in the completed runway in accordance with domestic standards.
For example, the release of hazardous substances is specified in the `Restrictions of hazardous substances and odour requirements in present and prefabricated surface finished products', requiring total volatile organic compounds to be no greater than 5 mg/m3, formaldehyde to be no greater than 0.4 mg/m3, carbon dioxide to be no greater than 7 mg/m3, benzene to be no more than 0.1 mg/m3 and odour class no higher than 3.
The new logo also provides details on sampling requirements, test rules, determination rules, etc. for plastic runways in primary and secondary schools.
In addition, for the first time, an artificial lawn on campus was included in the compulsory testing of national tenders.
In the near future, special work will be carried out on the implementation of the new national tender, which will be transmitted to the Department of Physical Health and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education during the year.
In the afternoon of September 30, China's new Internet client Chengdu is playing “The Civil War” in the finals of the 2018 Women's World Cup.
At the end of the day, Hu Yu Ling, a team friend of the Grand-Governance Master Tinning 4:0 Rik, took the throne of the female World Cup four years later, the twenty-first time the Chinese woman took the title of the tournament.
Tinning and Yu Ling are teammates and friends, and both are quite familiar with each other's tactics.
Both sides followed each other, be it in preparation for war or before the race.
On entering the finals, the two of them indicated, without meeting, that they had completed their mission.
But the match between Tinning and Jo Yu Ling in the game is a saber of swords.
In the first round, the winner of the tournament, the dinnings, was three to one, followed by the scoring of the score by the dinning error of Chu Yuling.
Then Jo Yu Ling's mistakes in the attack began to increase, and Dining seized the opportunity to take the lead by three minutes at 9:5 and to take the lead at 10:6.
In spite of the three-point pursuit, Tinning took the first round at 11:9 with the serve ball.
In the second round, Zhu Yuling ' s failures remain high, with Tinning taking the advantage of a confluence of 6:1 to take the lead.
During a lag of 2:7, Hu Yu Ling achieved two points by a change of rhythm, and later the attack was used to track the score to 8:9.
At a critical time, Tining won a two-point 11:8 and won another round.
In the third round, the two began with a sharper bite of 3:3 flat.
Dinning then lost three points by mistake in the attack, but she then pursued the score by six points with a sharp attack.
Hu Yu Ling's two-point line re-created the advantage and took the lead at 10:8.
But Dining attacked with extreme ferocity, winning four points and taking the third round at 12:10.
In the fourth round, Hu Yu Ling's 4:2 lead.
But since then, Tinning has demonstrated a super-intrusive state of attack, with a four-point hiatus.
After the suspension, Jo Yu Ling recovered some of her status and gradually pursued the score to 8:8 p.m.
Dinning didn't have a soft hand at the critical moment. Two points to the point.
With Jo Yu Ling back out of the world, Dining swept the opponent to the crown at 4:0.
Last month, Dining came to Chengdu with the crown of her 14-month-long champions in the Bulgarian public race, despite her saying before the race that she had not set a goal for the battle, and in the semi-finals, which ended this morning, Dinning said that she had fulfilled her mission.
In the end, Tinning won over his teammate, Joo Yu Ling, and won the personal third World Cup champion, and she was satisfied with her performance: “A champion is important to every athlete.
I didn't think of this before the race, but I just said that one fight, and the finals were still very happy."
When she said, "I think I can handle the stress side of the whole race, and the performance of Tinning today has been remarkable, leading to a failure to find rhythm."
Activating rural consumption depends on normalizing mechanisms to clean up markets, guide demand for healthy consumption and enhance farmers ' sense of access to consumption.
The data show that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released, with retail sales of consumer goods increasing 10.5 per cent in rural areas in the first half of the year, at an increase of 1.3 percentage points higher than in urban areas.
In a poor village in one of the western districts, the village had only one convenience store, entered the shop, some of the goods seemed familiar, the “goldfish” was marked as “gold dragon oil”, the “wang-boy” became a “glow milk” and the “shelter” commodities were numerous.
Over the years, similar phenomena have been subject to frequent exposure, and some rural pseudonyms with similar names, similar packagings, and disinformation have been inexorable.
A consumption survey published by a municipality in the west showed that rural traders had a serious problem with over-false goods, with 66 per cent of users buying fake goods at the sub-town supermarkets, of which more than half were food products.
Why is it that Li Chi still fights every year, as the authorities deal with the rural market?
Unlike urban markets, farmers are less aware of their rights, coupled with the remoteness of many rural areas, which are in a blind area with insufficient regulatory power, giving fertile ground to pseudo-goods.
A commodity has many headlines, some sectorally regulated prices, some managed production, some managed markets, cross-functionalities, annual vacations, centralized rule, trumped through the wind, then came out slowly, just after the old vacations, and new ones.
The lack of long-standing regulatory mechanisms, the impurity of the rural market, the low cost of breaking the law and the high level of profit have led some outlaws to become “downhill” and some rural areas to become “dismantling markets”.
From subsistence to welfare, large numbers of farmers are moving towards developmental consumption.
The party’s central government and the State Council issued a number of opinions on improving the institutional mechanisms for promoting consumption, which further boost the consumer potential of the population, in which they proposed to promote the upgrading of the rural population’s consumption ladder, with the aim of making the farmers “capable to consume” “will to consume” and to make rural consumption truly flourish.
On the one hand, there is a need to deepen reforms to eliminate the multiple, multi-managerial maladministration of market regulation, to improve food safety, product quality monitoring networks, and to continuously reduce the space available in rural areas for counterfeiting and selling.
On the other hand, greater enforcement and regulation of “fine veins” must not be allowed to spread in rural areas through false pretences.
Heavy punishment of pit farmers is the only way to protect farmers, and the fact that counterfeiters are much hidden should not be used as a justification for the creation of false goods. The authorities concerned should clarify their responsibilities, the underlying regulatory forces should sink, and any link that goes wrong must be held accountable, leaving the counterfeiters and the pseudo-sellers without a place to hide.
Strict market access, strict qualification of producers, market circulation, product orientation, clean-up, source, root, legal distributors, and farmers.
Activation of rural consumption, leading to healthy consumption demand.
As consumption escalates, many farmers not only seek to eat well, eat well, but also to live a high quality of life, such as culture, health, and the rural market cannot be equated with “low-quality” “low-cost” paintings.
This requires promoting the extension of e-commerce to large rural areas, the opening up of rural and urban two-way distribution channels, the integration of off-line industrial development platforms and on-line power trading platforms, and supporting the expansion of new patterns of consumption to rural markets; promoting the organic integration of commercial and trade logistics with recreational agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, among other things, in eligible townships; and improving the modern rural circulation network system, optimizing the integration of stock facility resources and effectively reducing rural circulation costs.
The creation of a clear and secure market environment for the rural sector, which discourages the consumption of farmers, makes it possible for rural consumption to flourish and enhances farmers ' sense of access to, and happiness in, consumption.
As of 1 November, our overall tariff level will be reduced to 7.5 per cent as part of the MFN rate for commodities.
Pursuant to the decision of the 26th ordinary session of the State Council, the State Council's Customs and Excise Committee issued a circular on 30 November 2018, which reduced the most-favoured-nation rates for some commodities as of 1 November 2018.
Pursuant to the State Council ' s Customs and Excise Commission ' s Proclamation on the Reduction of Tariffs on Imports of Selected Goods, the most-favoured-nation (MFN) rate for some goods, including industrial goods, was reduced as of 1 November of this year in order to accommodate the needs of industrial upgrading, lowering the cost of enterprises and meeting the multi-layered consumption of the population.
A total of 1,585 tax items, representing about 19% of the country’s total tax lines, fell from 10.5% to 7.8% on average, with an average reduction of 26%.
The tax reduction is mainly related to textiles; stone, ceramic, glass products; parts of iron and steel and base metal products; mechanical and electrical equipment and parts such as metalworking machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, transformer equipment, electrical appliances, instrumentation, etc.; and resource commodities and primary processes such as non-metal mines, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, precious stones, etc.
At the same time, as the overall level of tariffs, particularly on pharmaceuticals and imports of daily consumer goods, has been reduced downwards, the tariff lines of import duties on imported goods have been reduced accordingly.
As a follow-up to the decision-making deployment of the Party ' s Central and State Council, the country introduced zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported medicines on 1 May this year, reduced import tariffs on automobiles and spare parts and part-time consumer goods on 1 July, and implemented an information technology agreement extending the third step of the round-up of products.
Journalists have learned from the Customs and Excise Committee of the State Council that, since this year, after successive autonomous adjustments, our total tariff level has fallen from 9.8 per cent to 7.5 per cent in the previous year, an average reduction of 23 per cent.
Appropriate tariff reductions are conducive to balanced development of foreign trade and to higher levels of external openness, as well as to the integrated use of both domestic and international resources and to structural domestic supply-side reforms.
The relevant officials of the Committee stated that this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the opening up of the reform, and that the initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs is a practical step in the implementation of the spirit of the important speech of Secretary-General Xi Jinping at the Boaing Asia Forum, as well as an important step towards further expansion of the country ' s open and proactive import expansion in accordance with its own high-quality development needs, which demonstrates that China will firmly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy and, while enhancing its own development momentum, will also make China ' s development more beneficial to the world.
On 29 September, the launch of the regional public brand of “Circle Countrymen” agricultural products in Gansu prefecture took place in the southern Kai District of Tianjin City.
The Red Army's rice, black peas, mountain children's peas, Montenegrin sheep, tacky tea, paper-cut books, hand-held slippers... a piece of finely packaged agricultural produce placed on the stage, with a common brand name called the "Closed Countrymen".
“Build a regional brand of the ‘Circle Country’, effectively addressing the development bottlenecks of the ‘multiple scattered, small, and weak’ agricultural products around the county, becoming a powerful vehicle for the fight against poverty.” On 29th, the regional public branding of the ‘Close Country’ agricultural products, hosted by Gansu Quan Quan Quan, was held in Nankai, Tianjin.
The Circumpolar District is situated at the border of the three provinces of Kaning, which is a long-standing and resource-rich country, as the “advanced counties of the nation's food production”, “China's small groceries,” and “China's pixie village”.
The snacks of lamb, yellow wine, pasta, puppies, tender oatmeal, etc., are often reminiscent of the swimmers who are in the country.
As China ' s urbanization has increased, the urban population has grown rapidly, and a large number of young rural people have left their homes to begin urban life.
Chinese agricultural brand researcher Yang Xiaojia said: “Cities are now fast and under stress, and more and more people are beginning to miss the country as a child, but, ‘The home country is the home country, the most beautiful memory is the village’, and the ‘Circle Country’ brand was designed to be named after the country’s people and the country’s sorrows.”
The surrounding subdistricts have special climatic conditions, with long days of sun, very different day and night temperatures and unique conditions for the cultivation of small and mixed foods.
More than 20 small-scale groceries are produced in China, with the highest yield and the highest quality in the country.
Wang Xiao Rei, a local girl who attended school in Tianjin, participated as a volunteer in the presentation, saying: “The natives are the closest, the natives smell the best, the ‘circles’ brand brings out so much of our sorrow, memories, and the food there, and hopes that the ‘circles’ brand will move further away and do more.”
Dr. Tam Bin, researcher at the Scientific Research Institute of the National Food and Material Reserve, stated that, by testing more than 900 sets of indicators, the borough's agricultural products, such as rallied wheat, porridge and black beans, had a strong advantage, many of the physicoactive material content of the groceries was higher than the standard data, and that the “circle people” had an inherent advantage in taking over the country's high-end markets for groceries.
The District Committee Secretary, Chai Chun, said that through the publication of the `Girls' brand, the Quality Agricultural Quality Quality, Standardization, Scaled Innovation Development of the Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality, Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality Quality & & Quality & Quality Quality Development Quality Quality Quality Quality & & & Quality Quality Quality Quality & Quality Quality & Quality Quality & Quality Quality Quality Quality & & Quality Quality Quality & & Quality & & & & Q & Q Q Q Q Q & Q Q & Q Q Q Q & Q & Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q & Q Q Q Q & Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q & Q Q Q Q Q Q Q & Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q & Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q & Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q & & Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q
In July, Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.2 per cent over the previous month, a higher than expected increase, which warms up the market’s expectations that the Central Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If the interest rate really rises, it will be the fifth increase in the central bank's interest rate in a little more than a year.
The analyst for the Reuters interview had previously estimated an increase of 0.1 per cent.
According to Statistics Canada, on Friday, 12 of the 20 industries registered growth.
This data is noteworthy because the Central Bank anticipated earlier this month that temporary factors might drag on the third quarter of GDP data.
On Thursday, the Governor of the Central Bank of Canada, Poloze, promised that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates gradually and would pay close attention to economic data.
The next announcement of interest rates by the Central Bank of Canada will take place on 24 October.
As a result of the strengthening of the Canadian economy and the close to record low unemployment, the Central Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at the macro level, said that the country's GDP ring growth in the third quarter of the economy was expected to be around 2 per cent per annum.
“This would be more than the 1.5% expected by the Central Bank of Canada, and would therefore be another reason to expect the Bank to raise interest rates next month,” he said in a report.
The overnight index exchange shows that the market forecast for the BCC rate of increase in October rose from 76.46 per cent to 78.27 per cent.
In '65, for the first time, the Koreans jointly visited the Han River at the mouth of the sea.
The Korean Ministry of Defence confirmed that the day the DPRK launched a joint expedition to the waters of the sea mouth of the Han and Pingjin rivers.
The initiative is an advance preparation to guarantee the free navigation of civilian vessels on both sides.
A circular from the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea to the media on the same day indicated that this was the first joint visit of the two sides to the Han River to the mouth of the sea since the Korean War Armistice Agreement of 1953.
The Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea signed a military agreement in September this year, agreeing to undertake a joint study of the Han River into waters such as the mouth of the sea, starting in November, in order to guarantee the future environmental protection of the waters and the development of tourism.
In October, the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea planned a joint expedition to the waters at a general level.
The joint Korean-Korean water expedition was officially launched on 5 November.
The joint mission consisted of 20 Korean and Korean military personnel, experts, etc.
According to the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea, neither side carried any weapons during the mission, and it was prohibited to stimulate the other side ' s words and actions.
“As there is no military demarcation line near the estuary, the area was an unexpectedly high point, but through the joint expedition, it will become a new zone of peace in the future.”
The total length of the joint Korean-Korean expedition was about 70 kilometres, with a total area of about 280 square kilometres.
According to the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea, six cruise ships will be sent by the Korean side to detect seawater depth, etc., to provide the basic information for safe navigation in the waters; pending the completion of the investigation, navigation maps will be provided for the movement of civilian vessels.
In October 2007, a summit meeting was held in Pyongyang to reach an agreement on the joint use of the Han and Pingjin rivers at the sea port, but the subsequent negotiations were stunned by the tense situation on the peninsula.
In accordance with the military agreement signed by the Koreans in September, the future vessels of both sides are required to inform each other well in advance of the voyage to the common waters.
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia, on 5 November, the Chinese citizen Guo Yu Celery and Mao Yunxin lost contact during their tour in Mongolia in recent days.
It is understood that the two were members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team and that, on 19 October, they contacted their families and friends in the country, said that they were about to explore in the mountains near Lake Kusuguor and shared their positions through micromails, and that they had since lost contact and were suspected to have gone to the no-man ' s area.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and security of Chinese citizens in Mongolia and to consular protection and assistance.
Upon being informed of the loss of contact between the two visitors, the Embassy immediately launched a bail-in contingency plan and tried to seize the time of the gold rescue and to work at full capacity.
The Embassy maintained close communication with the family of the individual concerned, assisted the family in immediately reporting the incident to the police, and provided the family with a translation list for the choice.
The Embassy met with the heads of the Ministry of External Relations, the General Directorate of Police and the General Directorate of Emergency Situations of Mongolia at the first time, to inform them of the situation, to request that the search and rescue be carried out as soon as possible, and to maintain close communication with the Monk throughout the search and rescue process to ensure that the latest developments are kept up to date.
At the same time, the Embassy assisted the family in the publication of the tracing alert at Monwau, and widely mobilized the active participation of the Monthua diaspora and Chinese companies in the search, providing effective leads and providing assistance to a number of blue-sky rescue workers who were on their way to help with the rescue.
As a result of the Embassy ' s vigorous efforts, the first rescue team was dispatched by Mon Fung and promised a waiver of the search and rescue costs.
The General Directorate of Police and the General Directorate of Emergency Situations have instructed the police and the Emergency Department in Kusguor province to do their utmost to search and rescue.
Owing to the fact that Lake Kusukuur is located in the northern part of Mongolia on the border with Russia, remote, sparsely populated areas, extremely inaccessible traffic and communications, and that Mongolia is now entering a severe winter with temperatures of about 20 degrees below zero, the local police and emergency services have overcome enormous difficulties, mobilized almost all police forces and mobilized local herders, carrying out extensive day-to-day carpet search and rescue around the lost two persons ' positions, including by riding horses, walking and visiting herders.
At the same time, with regard to the special situation of pastoralist areas, Monfon has for many days been conducting circulars on radio.
National blue-sky rescue team staff have also been actively involved in the rescue, together with Monfon.
The safety and well-being of the two missing persons has always held our hearts.
So far, more than a decade has passed since the disappearance of the two persons, the Embassy has received a number of leads, but no two have been found, and search and rescue operations are still under stress.
The Embassy will remain committed to the “people-centred” principle and will continue to follow the matter, to promote the continuation of full search and rescue efforts and to provide maximum assistance to the families of the persons concerned.
The Embassy appealed to Chinese compatriots and enterprises to contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia at the first possible time if they were informed of the relevant leads.
