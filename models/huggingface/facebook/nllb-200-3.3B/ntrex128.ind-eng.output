Assembly Member (AM) Welsh worried when they looked like muppets.
There was concern among some MPs over a suggestion that their designation should be changed to MWPs (Member of Welsh Parliament).
This was due to the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The AMs across the political spectrum are concerned that it could invite ridicule.
A Labour MP said that his group was concerned, The debate was over Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
One assembly member (AM) said that his group, as a unit, was "not happy" and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that the group was "open-minded" about the name change, but judged that it was a play on the MWP's acronym for Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh w is pronounced like the Yorkshire English u.
The Assembly's commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any explanation of the designation for the AMs is of course a matter for the members themselves".
The 2017 Welsh Government Resolution empowered the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on a proposal that was found to have broad support to refer to the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the designation of AMs, the Commission favours WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option gained the most support in public consultation.
The MPs appear to be proposing an alternative, but the struggle to reach a consensus could be frustrating for the chair, Elin Jones who is expected to deliver a draft bill of the changes within weeks.
The reform bill would include other changes to the way the House works, including rules on disqualification for MPs and a draft committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians go to vote on a referendum on changing the country's name
The voters will decide the choice of whether the name of their country will be changed to Republic of North Macedonia.
The famous vote was held in an attempt to settle a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor signifies a recognition of its territory and has repeatedly rejected offers of EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, an opponent of the vote for the name change, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was a price to pay for joining the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are untouched when Harlem's churches are in trouble.
Historically, the old folks I talk to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner, Mr. Adam said
 Today, there are none. 
He said that the disappearance of all the bars was understandable.
"People socialize in a different way now", he said.
 The bar is no longer a neighborhood living room where people visit regularly.
Likewise with the church, he worried that the money from the sale of the assets would not last as long as the leaders hoped, and sooner or later they would start all over again.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not help maintain the remaining shrines around them.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings are white people", he said, "and therefore it will speed up the day when these churches close simultaneously because it is unlikely that the people who move into the condominiums will be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930's.
The black congregation that had been worshiping in the surrounding area had taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 caused severe damage to the building, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild, they built a bell tower.
Father David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's proudly called the tower's bell a "Poor man's bell".
A specialist who rang the bell of the tower in July gave it another name: A cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
Another expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also notes that this is the first bell tower in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to ringing the larger bell in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in the past few months is a complicated story of architecture and contractors, some brought on by lay church leaders, and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the governing body of the diocese, made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese would seek to charge fees to the vestry, even though the vestry was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy in a lobster diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was diving for lobster in California during the opening of lobster season, an officer said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy crying for help and then paddled in a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a burst of excitement after catching the lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I'm bitten!
I was bitten!
The whole of the pelvis was torn, which Hammel said he realized when he had reached the boy.
I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: There is a shark in the water! Hammel added.
The child was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was treated in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Coast Rescue Captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a week earlier, but it was categorized as a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper body.
Authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles realized that there were over 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them were considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan to break into the British beauty market
Sainsbury's took over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a second-hand-style beauty kiosk run by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial boost to the £2.8 billion British beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and homeware products decline, larger beauty kiosks will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and will be expanded to more stores next year if it proves successful.
Investments in beauty have become a hunting ground for supermarkets to make use of the shelves that were once used as TV, microwave, and home appliances.
Sainsbury's says that it will double the size of its beauty offering to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing brand lineup starting from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas such as those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also re-launched its boutique makeup line so that most of its products will be vegan friendly - something that is increasingly in demand by young shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small quantities of everyday necessities at local grocery stores mean that supermarkets have to do something more to entice people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said that the stalls will look more and more like malls as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the likes of Aldi and Lidl by providing more and no-food service.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets on hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat outlets since they bought both franchises two years ago, which it says has boosted the sale of everyday groceries and made the acquisition more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to renovate its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to split the profits of the chemist's shop inside the supermarket.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacy businesses to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceuticals franchise, for £125 million three years ago.
It was reported that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy across four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty kiosks to improve the ambiance for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, the enticing environment and convenient location signify that we are now a destination that challenges the old ways of shopping.
Peter Jones is in a rage after Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has left the show after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11m lifestyle business deal to focus on her new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time to manage their trademark household appliances and accessories, Truly.
The couple's business was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning used her Instagram account to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den's star, Petes Jones angry by pulling out at the last minute, from their lucrative branded lifestyle business - to focus on her bigger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "stunned" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their home appliances and accessories brand, Truly.
Their business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune by £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his vacation homes,
A source says: "Truly by far the most important priority of Holly.
It was going to be his long-term future, which would keep him going for decades to come.
His decision to back off left everyone involved in a state of shock.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch time.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office that's ready to be sold.
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most expensive stars, could cost the company up to millions of dollars due to large investments in products, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings, and the potential for further launch delays.
And this can mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones owned a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not be commenting on this business relationship".
Talking seriously and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would get from the news media for making comments that some considered to be "unpresidential" and having been very positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump giving up so much?
Trump said in a mocking voice, "I read your news".
I'm not giving anything away.
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting a second time after the previous meeting in Singapore in June, which was hailed by Trump as a step forward for the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea saw no "appropriate response" from the United States to the North's initial move to disarm.
Instead, he noted, the United States continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump is looking more optimistic in his series of speeches.
"We're doing our best with North Korea", he said.
If we go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will surely be killed.
Now we have this amazing relationship,
He said that his success in repairing relations with Kim had brought positive results - halting the rocket tests, helping to free the hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unorthodox approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd rather have about 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy an Island, Kill Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population is displaced, there is no national disaster declaration, as a prerequisite for international aid.
In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so this is a bit of a challenge, said Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster relief agency, said that Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute to providing aid.
Given the continuous earthquakes that Indonesia is experiencing, the country is still very unprepared to face the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on the rest of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite the danger warnings already sounded, most likely contributed to the loss of life.
At its best, travel between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The floating hospital that has been deployed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's damaged infrastructure the core of his election campaign, and he has spent money on highway and railway construction.
But a lack of funds has been hampering Mr. Joko's government while he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as Muslim and Christian mobs fought in the streets, using spears, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge receives a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards outside Chelsea's goal as his team trails 1-0.
He puts the ball on his left side before kicking it into the far post.
The ball bounces high above the goal as it bounces into the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally falls past Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumps and falls into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and took a chance and didn't think too much about it, and just did a kick.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue's striker gave Mateo Kovacic a pass on the play, before turning near the midfield and running fast into Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic quickly passed and ran into the midfield.
He then made a perfect shot, leading Hazard into the goal.
Hazard managed to pass the defender and kicked the ball into the goal corner with a left-footed kick, passing Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are facing Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday afternoon in London.
Death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832 people, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck Friday and triggered waves as high as 20 feet, Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency, said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, is littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John Street, at 7.55am with multiple stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked anyone in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I would ask anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may be recording something on the dashboard cam to contact us as they may have information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who feel certain that they know the woman have come to the scene to inquire about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police have said they are in the process of informing the next of kin.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews had just returned to his apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
The man couldn't say anything when he found out what was going on.
Right now the residents are being told that it will be a few hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer is heard telling someone that all areas are now being treated as crime scenes.
A woman showed up at the scene in tears.
He kept saying "This is terrible".
At 2pm, two police vans were in the line and the other was outside.
A number of officers are standing in line to monitor the apartment blocks.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCc, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 by quoting log 247 on 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell's Parliament became the last memorial to be damaged by the rewriting of history.
His expulsion would be poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of many British cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwellian community described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate about the destruction of statues, that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell's descendants will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's remarkable representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many still believe is worthy of celebration.
Lord Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as the defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case of course the kingdom.
Whether it is a fully accurate representation, is still the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century had shaped the development of the nation that followed, and Cromwell was an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that difference.
His success as Lord Protector is also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.
The Killer Pigs Torture Chinese Farmers to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeast Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a pigsty in the Liupanshui regional market of Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly went with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the door to the nearby pig pen had been opened.
He said that inside the pigsty was a large boar with blood in its mouth.
Forensic studies confirmed that the 550-pound male had molested the farmer to death, according to reports.
"My cousin's bed is bloody and shattered", said the cousin, known as Wu, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pigs had been caged to prevent them from attacking others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man badly injured.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife frightened the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but the scent of blood can act as a trigger.
They're just playing.
They're biters, very curious... they won't go out of their way to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect, she said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa brought heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States.
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause flooding across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, as of 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa's likely to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Palung began to form over the Pacific Ocean and moved eastward, toward the U.S. West Coast, as Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began to push tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create extensive heavy rain in the Southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates approaching 2 to 3 inches per hour at some points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain was expected in some parts of the Southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are likely to occur with conditions deteriorating rapidly due to the nature of the tropical rainfall.
It is highly discouraged to explore the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause the gorge to become a raging river and storms will bring local strong winds and dust.
The approaching swamps will cause localized heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Total rainfall of more than half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highway to become slippery.
This will be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, before rain becomes more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will extend to the four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some dramatic temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
There's a perfect example of the dramatic temperature variations across the central United States on Sundays.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will build up and spread again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to warm starting in October with a rapid spread of 80s from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate projections indicate a high probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the early-mid October.
Over 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people watched a riveting statement Thursday by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continues, with the broadcasters interrupting the regular show to report on an unexpected event at the last minute on Friday: a deal engineered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was groping her in a drunken state and trying to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
There are likely more than 20.4 million people, as reported by Nielsen on Friday, who have watched it.
The company calculated the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The countdown for other networks that broadcast this was not available in a timely fashion, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time counting the number of people who watched it in his office.
To put this in perspective, that's the same number of viewers as a football playoff or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose host opinion strongly supports Kavanaugh's nomination, topped all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearings, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million viewers and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The fans stay high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican Party office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being booed by protesters as he tried to get on the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood on his knees for a few minutes as he was taunted, live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", a woman said.
Do you think that he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have power when there are many helpless women".
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there was much else he needed to say in committee hearings.
Cable TV and broadcast networks are all covering live just hours later, when the Judiciary Committee will vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would examine the charges against the candidate over the next week, as the minority Democrats have requested.
Flake was reassured in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a few senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, because it was clear that the Republicans would have no voice to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and damaging national interests over its plans to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews featuring him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson emphasised the attack on what he called the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal about the UK and EU having to collect tariffs from each other was "totally absurd".
Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in jail on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on the items, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to the fatal shooting of Wayde.
The contract has been set at $350,000, the Advocate reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department is grateful to the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and the community for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement for their "persistence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
Standing at 6'6" tall living in Baton Rouge, where his father was, Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and jumped to 2.6 in games last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcanoes spew ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern area around Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased at the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in just over 24 hours.
The center is monitoring multiple rumbles and vibrations.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash sticking to the windshields of cars in neighborhoods around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have been recording increased activity at the volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as Don Goyo which has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence election celebrations.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after participants of a pro-independence demonstration clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarized vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists detained by riot police battered them with eggs and sprayed powdered paint, creating a dark cloud of dust on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Riots also took place later that day with police using their batons to control the riot.
For several hours pro-independence groups chanted "No Forget, No Forgiveness" in the face of a union march shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protest, local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region, a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters preferred independence, although voter turnout was low with those opposed to secession and most boycotting the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at TPS throughout the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped out all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer had any hope about the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of our finest moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we are stuck", she said.
Despite a narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year despite many of their well-known leaders, who are in exile or in prison awaiting trial, for their role in arranging the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protests with his cell phone in support of the police, said that the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more stressful", he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: How many men arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings says that the damage was to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
The goal scored by Menga has given Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly's first goal for Livingston ensured the victory
Livingston's victory resulted in Rangers sacking Steven Gerrard as manager of Ibrox, for their second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly's attack has been the proof of the difference when Gary Holt's side move equals Hibernian's in second.
Gerrard's side remain winless in the Premiership this season and face the Hearts leaders who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League, on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their unbeaten record in the division to six games, while head coach Holt is still reeling from the loss he suffered replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost a chance against a sloppy visiting team.
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their accuracy giving the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson made a breakthrough but missed the goal, then Alan Lithgow was able to extend his effort after sliding in and facing Craig Halkett's shot from across the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play the lead early, knowing that they could make it difficult for the visiting team to score a dead ball.
And that's how you generate goals that matter.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got a turn and scored from the middle of the field.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated the reigns but realised that the home defence was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was overall untouched,
The pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos managed to elicit a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was tackled by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow was sent off for another Livingston play.
Attacks kept coming to Livingston's goal and were continually avoided, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge to substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for the handball - were rejected.
The phenomenal of livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena, which is the home of the BBC's annual football match.
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
To a man, they're extraordinary, continually exceeding expectations on this ever-upward trajectory.
Their style of play and personnel have hardly changed since their return to the top flight, but great credit must be given to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has so many champions.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lack inspiration.
As good as they were in their time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was not good - only once could they break the home side's formation - and it was a warning to the Rangers, who realized their presence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan has had a mixed reception in Cologne.
There were smiles and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved to the surrounding area to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also took to the streets, denouncing both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The resistance protests depicted the contradiction of the existence of an immigrant who was hailed as a hero by some German Turks and reviled as a dictator by others.
Deptford Highway collision: A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy thoroughfare in Deptford, in the southeast part of the city, at approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car had stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist died in a head-on collision on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan Police said that officers are trying to identify the man and notify his family.
Roads have been closed and bus lane diversions have been imposed and motorists are being urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in the riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a maximum security men's prison, the police department said.
The chaos erupted at the Long Lartin HMP prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist Officers "Tornado" have been deployed to deal with the riot, which involved eight prisoners and occurred on one side of the building.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesperson said: Specially trained wardens have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend longer behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the prison warden was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October of last year, a riot police officer was called into the prison to deal with a serious disturbance where a correctional officer was attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding
Tropical depressions like Arizona's are rare, but they're likely to occur early next week as the trail of energy left by Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert to the southwest, raising the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for the region of western Arizona to southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight past Phoenix on Tuesday, hitting Monday night with a rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that there have only been ten tropical cyclones capable of producing a tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest Storm Center Forecast is capable of predicting two to four inches of rain with isolated numbers reaching six inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other desert regions of the southwest including the central Rockies and Great Basin are most likely to be affected by 1 to 2 inches, with a possible number of isolates as high as 4 inches.
For those in flood-free areas, Rosa rain may be a blessing because the region is suffering from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the southwest region is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, only about 40 percent of Arizona experienced at least some extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, the path that Hurricane Rosa took led to land across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico
Rosa, still at storm strength on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encountered a cooler area of the Pacific and therefore weakened in strength.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm force by Monday afternoon or night.
Rainfall may be high in parts of Mexico, raising the risk of flooding
Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected to hit the Baja California region as far as the southwestern region of Sonora, possibly rising to 10 inches,  weather.com reports.
Rosa will then cross north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will cross through Arizona and into southern Utah by Tuesday midnight.
The main risk posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is very high precipitation in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. desert southwest region.
The rains are expected to cause the threat of floods and debris flowing into the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: arrest of four suspects in attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, police said.
Officers have called for anyone who may have video footage of the incident on their cell phone to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "receives hatred and anger" from Democrats
"One vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and shameful policies", Trump said at a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "received the hatred and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nominating process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually assaulted him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the intelligence and the quality and the courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most perfect legal minds of our time, a juror with a record of true public service", he told the West Virginia supporters' crowd.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the midterms.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I wasn't running, but I was really racing, he said.
That's why I go around, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argued that Democrats were on a mission to "defend and block".
The first procedural vote at the Senate level on Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with the death toll rising
At least 384 people were killed, many were swept away as giant waves hit the coast, as a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-meter (18-foot) wave washed ashore at dusk, causing many deaths and destroying everything it passed.
A tsunami followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away so they became victims, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, timber, houses, everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the high seas at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 service centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the BNPB show many destroyed buildings and shops, a crooked and collapsed bridge and a mosque surrounded by water.
A series of aftershocks rocked the city along the coast on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Bureau of Technology Research and Development (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the blast of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, can magnify the size of a tsunami, so to speak.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under the ruins of the destroyed building, he said, adding that there were 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and damage could have been greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication is completely paralyzed with no information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its members and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy, but it could be worse", he said.
The agency on Saturday received criticism for not informing the public that a tsunami was hitting Palu, although authorities said that the waves had already hit by the time the warning was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the roof of a building being heard shouting a warning of an approaching tsunami in panic to people on the streets below.
Within minutes, the waters swept over the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami were the biggest cause of power outages that cut off communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the refugees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport has reopened for relief efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesian tsunami victims increased to over 800.
That was awful.
When World Vision employees from Donggala had managed to reach Palu safely, where they were sheltering in a canvas tent built in their office yard, they had passed through a number of rough areas, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed", he said.
That was horrible.
Even as relief groups slowly began to move in to begin relief efforts, some of the groups complained about the denial of skilled foreign volunteers to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, aid goods and labor from abroad can only be started if the disaster area has been officially declared as a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the Government says, OK, this is a national disaster,  we can accept international help, but there is no such status yet. 
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and family of the missing victims are still hoping that their loved ones will be part of the miracle that will mend the dark storyline of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled from the gutter.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parasailing team, has been the coach of the two missing parasailers, who were at the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel, with Mr. Mandagi, are his disciples.
"As a senior in the parasailing field, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how after news of the Roa-Roa Hotel's destruction circulated around the para-yacht community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who were participating in the festivities on the beach.
All of his messages, however, received only one grey check mark instead of two blue ones.
"I think it means the message wasn't sent", he said.
Robbery took $26,750 during an ATM charge in Newport on the Levee.
A robbery on Friday morning, stealing $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM storage box in Newport, according to a tip from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a news release.
While he was working, another man "ran after the Brink workers" and stole a bag of money to be sent.
Eyewitnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to news reports, but police did not say how many people were involved.
Anyone with information on their identities can contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change via Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Formerly formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has had the nickname Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was made before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, when she was expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande to perform on the show, which was canceled due to "emotional reasons", the show's creators said.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, West has previously said that for him the word has a religious meaning.
I believe "ye" is a common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you", West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with Big Boy Radio.
So I am you, I am we, the name is we.
It's taken from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye - as a mirror of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we really are.
He's one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has variously been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO vows to use no military against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians ahead of the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against the students.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already guaranteed support for Mexico's youth by providing monthly subsidies for those who are in college and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are encouraging young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding of A.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funding it will spend on research in the field, said A2 investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even as the U.S. as a whole lacked a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the funding for AI research is a good start, given that all other countries tend to lag behind the U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chance that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, author of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that beat the best American Othello players, and after that he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge for the Defense Advanced Research Projects and asked when the next activities would be held, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government prizes, Lee says.
"It's not China that's taking academic leadership; it's companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring university-level people for AI research in the last few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. to support efforts around AI.
"I think green cards can be automatically offered to holders of a PhD in AI", he said.
The Chinese State Council released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding for people in academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Sciences Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense developed the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, recently DARPA invested over 100 million dollars a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for the creation of a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence saw no follow-up for months.
Macedonians vote on changing the name of the country
Macedonians voted on Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its bids for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name represents a recognition of ownership of its territory and has barred the country from joining NATO and the European Union.
The two sides of the government reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opposition argued that the change would undermine the identity of the majority of the Macedonian ethnic Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the election and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the result could reach the minimum 50 percent required for the result to be declared valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Do you agree to NATO and EU membership by accepting the existence of a treaty with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a fair price to pay for Macedonia's membership in the EU and NATO, one of the countries born of the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to give my vote for the future of the country, for the young generation of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will abide by the vote to make a decision.
The name change requires a two-thirds vote in the parliament.
The state election commission says there have been no reports of violations as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to cast my vote for my children, where we are in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko give their ballots for the general election in Macedonia in order to change the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, has already prepared a small stage and pulled chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
"We agreed to join NATO and the EU, but we want to join in a dignified way, not through the servant's door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
I believe most of the population will agree to it because more than 80 percent of our people support the European Union and NATO, Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He said his results would be our future confirmation.
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday suggested that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - less than the number needed.
Another poll, organized by TV station Telma Makedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to cast their vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the vote to be successful, it would take 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure to vote would represent the first policy rejection of a pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scouring the whole of Brighton's defence to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deployed as Brighton defenders in Saturday's 2-0 victory over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made the victory look very easy on his 65th-minute score.
The Argentine striker received a midfield strike early in the game.
He ran through three of Brighton's defenders, before daringly entering the open court.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four men with green caps.
He's circled past one defender before running ahead of a few more on the Brighton goal line.
Then he's gonna pass to his left, to Sterling.
The England forward used his first kick from the back of the goal to pass the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his legs", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We're talking about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that time.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early lead in the Premier League battle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero receives the ball, far inside Brighton's territory on that play.
He passed the ball with a stunning long-range shot through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little bit of a shake before leading Sterling into the far post.
Sky Blue's forward passes the ball to the goal just before it slides out of bounds.
City play Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to sue the spoilers versus the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there's no reason to force another game.
But the overly competitive Scherzer is hoping to outplay the Colorado Rockies in Sunday's game, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies had at least earned a berth after winning a wild-card game against the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but were still looking to win their first division title.
Even though we're playing without winning, at least we can get a feel for this Denver crowd and the other teams that will be competing at the highest level of any point I might face this year.
How could I not want to compete in such a game?
The Nationals have not announced the opening game for Sunday, but it is reported that in such circumstances, they are likely to let Scherzer play.
Scherzer, who will be starting for the 34th time, held a practice session on Thursday and started Sunday's game which is usually used for rest.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 earned run average (ERA) and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is campaigning in West Virginia.
The president was implicitly referring to the situation involving his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
Everything we've worked for is at stake in November.
Five weeks before the most important election of our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't really run that's why I'm fighting all over the place for the outstanding candidates", she said.
Trump continued, "You see a very, very, very scary group of radical Democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they decided to take back power by any means, you see their evil, their cruelty.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to rely on to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "reject and block".
"And you see that over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and evil and vicious and untrustworthy".
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, which was greeted with loud cheers from his audience.
Remember what the answer was?
Did you leak the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for him - that was some very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a public service.
Now be intolerant of anyone who expresses his opinion
When Momentum activists at my local party voted to censure me, it was no surprise.
After all, I was the last of the MPs, who were told that our presence was not expected - all because we were expressing an opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she spoke out against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the anti-movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, an issue that is ironically the same one that Jeremy Corbyn is arguing with the previous leadership.
The notice for the East Nottingham workers' meeting on Friday stated that "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive".
For almost eight years I've been a member of the local Labour Parliament, the General Committee meeting on Friday night was exactly that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many of the meetings and promises about politics that are "better, more friendly" have long been forgotten, if, indeed, they ever began.
Differences of opinion within the workers' party were increasingly clearly not tolerated and each opinion was assessed on its merits by the party authorities.
It started soon after Jeremy became leader, as a colleague who I thought would share the same political views, began to expect me to turn around and accept positions that I would never have accepted before - both in national security and in the EU single market.
Whenever I spoke publicly - and no matter what I said - it was followed by a barrage on social media calling for the appointment to be cancelled, denouncing central politics, telling me I shouldn't have been in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me who's experiencing it.
Of course, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and the restraint of my colleagues who face sexual harassment or racism every day but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current political era is how much abuse has been taken for granted.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should help develop a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer on the wider church and with every motion of no confidence or changing the party rule selection becomes more limited.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years that encourages me to keep my head down, not to voice my opinion too much, and then I'll say, "Okay".
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that resulted in my comprehensive school classroom literally crashing, I have been fighting for better public services for those who need it most - both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I've never hidden my political activities, including the last election.
No one in East Nottingham will question my policy position and the things I disagree with in the current leadership.
To those who voted for the motion on Friday, all I can say is that as the country moves quickly towards a separation of sovereigns, it will put at risk our country's businesses and our public services, and I don't want to waste time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the Labour party.
But really, one of my messages is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, as a member of the Labour Party or not, that I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political policy will ever stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr climbs to the top of the standings
The last two attempts may have been a bit cheating the final result, but it was no doubt deserved that Ayr won Tennent's very entertaining Premiership game today.
Now they're in the top spot, the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, and ability to grab the best chances, that made the home team and coach Peter Murchie's team's right to feel good.
"We've tested our game so far, and we're still unbeaten so we're happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "A credit to Ayr, they're better at taking chances than we are".
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but the yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, given at that game by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Baggot scored the try unconverted.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, just in mid-time, he scored then made a single try to make Ayr's score 17-5 at half-time.
However Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try was altered by Baggot, reducing the chances to five points.
Then there was a long break as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury, was knocked out, and since the restart of the match, Ayr has been speeding faster than the attempt of Stafford McDowall, changed by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then dealt a yellow card and again, Melrose made a reserve player pay with an unchanged Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a hard-fought pressure.
The hosts had returned to play, however, as Struan Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for striking Climo without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind the injured Ayr forward.
Climo was replaced, as he was again, almost from the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe kicked the goal and thwarted the fifth attempt of the opener Gregor Henry.
Still Game star looks ready to take on her new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star Kieran looks set to make a move into the service industry after it was previously revealed that he was named a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he directs and also stars in alongside his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair have already announced that the upcoming ninth series is the final episode, and apparently Kiernan plans to drive the live broadcast after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the burgeoning restaurant business in Glasgow.
The sea is ours: landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the Pacific.
The sailors were patrolling the naval headquarters located in La Paz.
The public building hoisted a blue sea flag.
Naval bases from Titicaca to the Amazon are polished with the motto: The sea is our right by law.
To rise again is an obligation.
Across landlocked Bolivia, memories of the loss of a coastline to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict are still vivid - like a longing to once again sail across the Pacific Ocean.
That expectation is likely to reach its peak in a few decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course positive expectations about the outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians who will be watching the ICJ trial on large screens across the country, hope that the court in The Hague will uphold Bolivia's demand that - after decades of tense negotiations - Chile be obliged to negotiate a guarantee of Bolivian sovereignty over the oceans.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has a lot of support at Monday's hearing.
We're very close to the return of the Pacific Ocean, he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule on Bolivia's wishes - and that will only change slightly if it can.
The Dutch-based UN agency has no power to cede the territory to Chile, and has determined that it will not decide the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the ICJ ruling came just six months after the final arguments had been heard, indicates the case is not complex,said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
And yet far from continuing Bolivia's claims, in the last four years it may have actually suffered a setback.
"The problem of access to the sea is being hijacked by the Bolivian government now", she said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has undermined the goodwill of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point still be in talks, but it will be very difficult to continue the discussion after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivian government's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea of a quick decision.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - used the maritime issue as a political prop.
Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The trial was an opportunity to see if we needed to resolve the past.
North Korea says a nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said first his country would never disarm if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made the statement on Saturday during the UN General Assembly.
He mentioned the United States implementing an agreement made at a meeting in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is seen as about to start nuclear diplomacy that has been stalled for more than three months after a meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was only a "dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. rejection of the declaration of the end of the Korean War would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington is careful to approve the declaration without Pyongyang making any attempt to restrict its armed forces first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to have a second meeting.
But doubts are spreading that Pyongyang is serious about recognizing the arsenal as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show show displays a huge array of the latest headwear collections right down to the main street near you
If you want to add to your collection of hats or really want to be protected from the sun, look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne have released a series of large-size headgear for their SS19 collection on the stage of a fashion show with stunning style held at Paris Fashion Week.
The totally impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and these designers have already showcased their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's signature feature is a cream-colored hat with a wide brim that covers the model's head.
The large-sized accessories include a diamond-encased watermelon, a witch's hat and even a pineapple, but they are not made to warm the head.
Thom Browne also shows off a collection of bizarre masks - and right before Halloween.
Lots of colorful masks with lipstick sewn in and out that look more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creates a scuba suit with a snorkel and goggles, while the other looks like melted ice cream.
And if you keep browsing through the fashion collections of the great -- then you're in luck.
Fashion observers predict that such a collection of big hats will be marketed to the main street near you.
Oversized hats are a big hit in La Bomba, with two-foot-wide straw hats seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The glorification of the label behind the very impractical hat -- the craze of social media -- has created a huge crease on the beach catwalk of straw bags that are almost the size of swimsuits -- worn by a model of a shell.
The burnt orange rafia bag, trimmed with a rafia on the edge with a white leather strap, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity hairdresser Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm hoping to see big hats and beach bags arrive on the high street for next summer - as designers are already making a big impact, it's going to be hard to ignore the demand for such big accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish private schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with outstanding test results, further enhanced by each student's individual and collective success in sports, the arts, music and hard work.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best possible service for students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their role as world citizens.
As the education sector is able to design and implement the school curriculum as expected, we see modern languages continuing to be a popular and desirable elective subject in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, what you say goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, it will reach his heart".
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone when it comes to building relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest exam results this year, we can see that language is at the top of the league table with the highest passing score in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received A Plus.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students got A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also got A's.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages, as elective subjects, are held to the same standard as STEM subjects in modern school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Department for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons employers struggle to fill vacancies, 17 percent is due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly being encouraged to prepare young people for their future careers.
With an increasing number of job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if they have already learned a second language, in the future they will experience the real benefits of having this kind of lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with residents of a foreign country will automatically make a multilingual a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them do not speak foreign languages well enough to carry on a conversation and French is the only language spoken in the double digit percentage, at 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education for today's children is so important right now.
Having a multilingual skill, especially the languages of countries with developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach a different language.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important in the UK for the next few years, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in a self-contained school, staffed by experts in the field.
Scotland's independent schools are intended to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It is undeniable that today, in a global business environment, language will always be an important aspect in determining the future of a country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans' wait to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not been determined how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play just a few minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to do pre-season games to get ready", he said.
Trump's scheduled rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump kicked off his campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
This is Trump's first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at some of the more pleasant spots that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
Having been assured that the vote was postponed so that he could choose the Supreme Court's nominee, Trump intended to build support for him for the upcoming midterm elections as the Republicans risked losing control of Congress if the vote was held in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET this Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online via live broadcast on YouTube.
It's likely Trump will address this week's trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which is heightened by the allegations of sexual misconduct and the prospect that the Senate vote will be delayed for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this rally agenda is to help the Republican party gain some momentum in the run-up to the November general election.
Therefore, the Trump campaign said that the five rallies next week are aimed at "reassuring volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is very important to his agenda so the president will travel to as many states as possible as we face a busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally is expected to draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as Pittsburgh media coverage", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in a month, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the West Virginia Republican Senate candidate who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come in as an attempt to boost his poll numbers", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team defends its hopes in a single game on Sunday
After a three-sided one-sided session, a Saturday afternoon foursome session is what may be needed in this Ryder Cup.
Momentum swing is a sporting concept that is the result of a discovery that is fully trusted by the players, and nothing is more than in this competition.
Where do they think the momentum is now?
"Before, they were six points ahead and now they're four, so I think we're taking it as a little bit of a momentum", said Jordan Spieth as he passed the day.
Europe certainly has the advantage of having a four-point lead with twelve games to play.
But Team America, as Spieth says, feels they have a little bit of momentum and they have a lot of things to be excited about, not the least of which is the Spieth and Justin Thomas lineup that's been playing together all day and boasting three out of four points each.
Spieth has played deadly from the tee to the green and led by eighth.
The celebrity's screams of rage grew louder as his turn came, making the crucial putt to make the series as he and Thomas lost two-on-two.
His putting hit that won them on the 15th was met with a similar shout, a shout that told you he believed America was invincible.
"You really have to try harder and worry about your own match", Spieth said.
All these players are gone now.
18 holes that need to be marked.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup legends.
The unique but interesting pair of Europeans is four for four and can do without error.
The "Moliwood" were the only pair to not bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seemed to flow both in and out of this boisterous crowd convinced that they were the players to beat on Sunday, and no player more famous than Fleetwood or Molinari would have locked in the potential for European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
It's better if at the same time both are placed in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were shortening the work of Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine is like digging a hole that these Spanish and Swedish golfers will never be able to climb.
Although, on Sundays no one can help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are great shows to look at more closely because of the interaction between the partners, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how strategies can change in an instant.
So far, Europe played better as a team and led by a long way into the final day, but the foursome session also showed that the US team had the guts to compete despite doubts by some, especially in the United States.
Europe up 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will take advantage of the final day of the Ryder Cup after bouncing back from Saturday's fourball and foursome matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired by the duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, they lead with two wins over Tiger Woods who has struggled to score their points so far at Le Golf National with four.
European team Thomas Bjorn, looking to defend the trophy they missed at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team who missed a goal in the morning fourball, making the score 3-1.
The United States put up more matches in foursome, winning two games, but they could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debut to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Molliwood" after the sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball they became very solid to beat Woods who was stumbling and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a more decisive 5&4.
Woods, who forced his way through two games on Saturday, has occasionally been brilliant but he has lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting on the morning fourball, then returned to pair with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2&1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three world.
Europe did not reach it on its own, despite a nice, windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record with two points on Saturday.
They got an exciting 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in fourball then came back again to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursome after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit to win a single game, though as the defending champion, Furyk's team needed only a tie-breaker to retain the trophy.
However, after being second best for two days, Sunday's counterattack looked like it was going to overtake them.
North Korea says 'impossible' to unilaterally disarm without any confidence
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that the sanctions were continuing to deepen their mistrust of the United States and that it was impossible for the country to unilaterally dismantle its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and pledging not to develop nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no trust in our national security and in such a situation it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves first unilaterally".
While Ri repeated the same complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be punished for taking a step-by-step approach, his significant statement conveyed that they did not reject it completely as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between US presidential officials and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to pursue the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea has wanted an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first stop its nuclear weapons.
Washington also rejected calls to ease heavy international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insisted on "denuclearization first" and increased pressure with the imposition of sanctions, reaching their goal by force, and even rejecting the "declaration of the end of the war"," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion of people who don't know about us.
The problem is that such continued sanctions will only deepen our mistrust".
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the problematic party in this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not end up in this kind of dead end".
However, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean rockets on the US mainland was inevitable after "Mr. President Devil" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at a UN meeting, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, lavished praise on Kim for his courage in taking the step to strip it, but the big job is still to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter", he said.
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for its actions.
However, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "Enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue with firmness and must not fail until we know that denuclearization is complete, final and verified".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to stop Pyongyang's financing of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that in fact there had been progress, only that North Korea within hours of the incursion was making "a claim like a gangster".
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and also the nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate action".
He stated that Kim's telling him to "act in accordance" with his wishes was a guarantee of the security Trump promised in Singapore and moving toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students taking a course on adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is getting all of the freshmen there to sleep more, in an attempt to counter the growing macho culture of learning through caffeinated "owl man".
One academic found that students at the world's leading universities often know nothing about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
'Finally a girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I only being told now, in my senior year?'
The girl said nobody ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched for the first time this year, explains to students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students who were severely sleep deprived throughout the week.
This hour-long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session, we had a picture of a dorm room, where students clicked on coffee cups, curtains, sweatpants, and books to get an explanation of the effects of caffeine and lighting, and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants were given an explanation of how the length of time they had been deprived of sleep could increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encouraged participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know this won't change student behavior instantaneously.
But we believe that they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the effects of choosing to smoke on your health,' adds Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in being 'over-sleeped' still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students means sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough, high-quality sleep should be your "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he says - even to avoid gaining weight, since lack of sleep causes the brain to activate a hunger mode, causing a persistent hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California resident who studied physical chemistry and biology who helped Professor Czeisler design the course, had taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize a course for the entire campus.
Next, he hopes that all graduate students will be instructed to complete a similar course of study before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students should consider setting a bedtime alarm, as well as a wake-up alarm, and be aware of the effect of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can shift your circadian rhythm out of its proper course and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal has brought down Gerrard's men
Once again, the Rangers felt the sadness of the away day as Dolly Menga's attack brought Steven Gerrard's divorced team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win in their journey, since the 4-1 victory in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side had just handed Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager, causing his side to fall eight points behind championship leaders Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
The offense is seven minutes out of first period and the Rangers' minds are at the point of no return.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, just a goal behind Hibernian.
And there could be further trouble at the Rangers' camp after linebacker Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Instead, Holt goes with the same Livi 11 that took a point off Hearts last week and he'll be happy with a costume that dazzles their opponents at every opportunity.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston's made better use of the ball they had.
They should have scored in two minutes when Scott Pittman's first short passed through Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder pulled the big one too wide.
A free kick by Keaghan Jacobs in and then by captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only stab wide at the back.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than faith about their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have been given a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided at the quarter but the referee Steven Thomson rejected the appeal of the Colombian.
Rangers managed just two throws in the first half but the previous Ibrox keeper, Liam Kelly, was almost never in trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's easily tamed attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been against the course of the match, no one can deny that they deserved it for their own hard work.
Once again the Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep-ball deadball tactic.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm in his choice of a simple end.
Gerrard acted during the break by substituting Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the substitution had almost an immediate effect as the winger put the ball on Morelos but Kelly's impressive play quickly came out of the line to intercept.
But Livingston continued to force the away team to play exactly the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
Holt's team should have extended their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood well to drive Jacobs off before Lithgow backed wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty as he clashed with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned the ball over.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now from the pages of our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago to the day, and the day will continue to grow... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device being called the Geiger counter.
A staple of science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become a pop culture icon, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the less-than-convincing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What is that thing?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter, used to find the location of radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals".
Evans: "Say, it must be coming out now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But it was that discovery that kept his name alive.
New cancer vaccines teach the immune system to "recognize" the bad cells
New cancer vaccines teach the immune system to 'recognize' and kill harmful cells
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
His method involves the process of extracting immune cells from the patient, transforming them in the laboratory
They can then 'identify' the proteins common to many cancers and then inject them again
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman was treated with the vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize the malignant cells, and her ovarian cancer went away for more than 18 months.
This method involves extracting the patient's immune cells, changing them in the lab so they can "identify" a protein commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cells back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the United States National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, says: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
The same approaches as taking a patient's immune cells and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells have been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West started a pro-Trump diatribe, wearing a MAGA hat, after his appearance on SNL.
Not Going Well
Kanye West was teased in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he praised United States President Donald Trump and said that he would run in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, entitled Ghost Town in which she wore the Make America Great hat, she challenged the Democratic party and reiterated her support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Yeah, if I was worried about racism, I'd be out of America a long time ago", he said.
SNL begins the show with a dramatic performance starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's beating was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with the post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble backstage because of the hat he was wearing.
"They were driving me backstage.
They said, 'don't go out with that hat on.'
They're ripping me off!
And then they said I was drowning", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West goes on to say, "Do you want to see where it sinks?" saying that he'll be wearing Superman's robe, because this means you can't dictate what I have to do.
Try to love".
His comments generated at least two bursts of ridicule from the audience and the SNL cast looked ashamed, Variety reported, with one person telling: "The whole studio is silent".
West was brought in at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, the ex-girlfriend of rapper Mac Miller who had just died a few days ago.
West confused many with his performance of the song I Love it, dressed as Bottle Perrier.
West was endorsed by TPUSA conservative group chair Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR FOLKING THE PEOPLE".
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being himself and that's really, really good".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I believe embraces and spews an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the creature officially known as Kanye West".
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was given the name Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, turning his name into a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has criticized toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his swordplay in his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, refutes the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such screen roles often make teenage boys feel that they must be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that she believes 'something is wrong' and questions how to deal with the bad masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, said he felt "strong enough" to address the issue.
'I feel personally, quite strongly, at this moment - where did we go wrong in this masculinity?' he said.
'What are we teaching the men as they grow up, about the problems we see today?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the emergence of bad masculinity with its overly masculine characters.
He continued: 'Which is the character that is born and what is taught?
What is it that is taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes boys feel that they must have this particular side to be a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change it?
Because there's obviously something wrong with the young people.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not be playing in the prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he was 'done with the battlefield and the horses'.
As of November Kit will star in Sam Shepard's return of True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting his wife Rose to be the best reason to quit Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, thus giving me a future family, and from here my life began' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the estate of the Leslie family's residence in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
However, over the years the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be increasing.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
A lot of disease transmission comes from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that staff had leaked GOP senators' data, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of her staff members had sent the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators to the lawmaker's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat Party insists that the claims were driven by experts and "ultra-right wing" websites.
"Lies, lies, and more vicious lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It's reported that the information released includes the home address and phone number of United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
This leak came up shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the post was connected to Waters' office and revealed information of one of Waters' staff members, Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and is an absolute lie", Waters continued.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information, and safety are threatened by false and false accusations - are in no way responsible for this leak.
This baseless accusation is completely wrong and is an absolute lie".
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This objection is an outrage", Fleischer wrote.
"It shows he is not fit to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
They can't deviate.
They can't question the accuser's motives.
They must be peaceful and quiet".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is seeking to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his views on Twitter.
"Big if true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Water said his office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he continued, "and they will be held legally accountable for all their actions that are damaging and dangerous to any and all members of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again review - a spoof of the not-so-good spy Rowan Atkinson
It's now a tradition to find Brexit significance in every new film with a biased British view, and that seems to be true for the re-emergence of the Johnny English parody-comedy franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the sarcasm of how obviously bad we are become a new export opportunity for this country?
Anyway, the squinting, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has renewed his license to screw things up for a second time - his name hinting more than anything that he's a sprawling comic creation designed for the non-English-language cinema realm.
He's clearly a crazed secret agent who, despite his bizarre appearance, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a bit of an adventurer who contributed a bit of note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Indeed, he was based on the international traveler and mystery man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving a mess behind.
There's been one or two sweet moments in this latest JE trip.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter in a medieval suit of armour and the rotor blades snap up to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy was shown, but his humor was felt to be under-energetic and too bizarre, especially when "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible had been confident to include comedy as an ingredient.
His humour felt as if it were directed at children rather than adults, and to me the various misadventures of the odd Johnny English were as uninventive and as focused as the jokes of the Atkinson silent films in Bean's persona.
The premise that's been heating up these years is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the top-secret network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the disappointment of the agents in charge - unfortunately only a minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for the arrogant and antagonistic prime minister, who has completely destroyed his political popularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job of playing a quasi-Teresa-May character but there is not much to be made of her script.
His clever advisor informs him that since every active spy has been weakened, he must bring one out of retirement.
And that means that the clumsy Johnny English himself, now employed as a headmaster in some fancy building, but giving a secret lesson on how to conduct an undercover operation: there's some good jokes here, when English offers a spy academy like School of Rock.
English is returned to Whitehall for emergency diversion and is reunited with his long-suffering friend Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a role of a high-class, annoying woman in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat eliminated.
So Batman and Robin, who have done wrong to the Secret Service's Highness, are back in action, meeting the mysterious beauty Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is alarmingly falling under the spell of a charismatic tech millionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their silly adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French fast-food restaurant; they create havoc by smuggling themselves onto Volta's luxury ship; and English ignites anarchy when she tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize herself with Volta's interior.
All the stops were obviously pulled for the final sequence, but with such kindness and cunning, there's a little children's TV channel that contains about everything.
A moderate enough thing.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that was truly worthy of her talent?
The workers protested that they were designing a plan for the British to work four days a week but be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would have the British working four days a week - but paid for five days.
The union reportedly wants company owners to pass on the savings through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them extra days off.
He'll let the employees have a three-day weekend - but still get paid the same.
Some sources say that the idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to encourage the state to support workers.
The move to a four-day week has been approved by the British Chamber of Commerce as a way for workers to experience the benefits of economic change.
A senior union source told The Sunday Times: 'The review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'This will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers as well as the party's industrial strategy as a whole.'
Labour was not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party had already promised a four-day working week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, at present such aspirations are not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: 'A four-day week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to perfect his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "catchers" at the utility company.
This shadow chancellor's plan also means that the current shareholders in the drinking water company may not get back all of their shares because the Labour government can make a 'reduction' on the grounds of perceived infringement.
He also confirmed his plans to put workers on company boards and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees, which would pocket an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their view
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week, raising questions about whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Seems Kennedy's more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said I'm going to be at the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this, the accusation came up, and said, 'Did you do it?'
He is a man of determination, of purpose, of determination".
However, it seems that Graham's voice will not be changed.
"My mind has already made up its mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it takes a bigger charge to change it", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but what I do know is this: Brett denied it out loud", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people he mentioned couldn't verify it.
He was 36.
I don't see any new changes".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a string of stars who perform with a remarkable, and memorable, mission: end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will witness tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against poverty.
To get free tickets to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must complete a series of tasks or actions such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goals over the past 12 years?
Is the idea of giving away free concerts a valid way to get people to take action, or is it just another case of what's called "clicktivism" - people feeling like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing for another goal.
It said the action has helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group has amassed 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, at least $10 billion of which has been channeled or funded.
The group estimates that safe funds have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and executives committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make this social inequity of malnutrition a footnote in history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs on their website that asked "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen responded: "It's going to be a long and difficult road - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that came before us, we will succeed, because when we unite we will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the stars who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use Navy as "blockade" to curb Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could ask for naval assistance to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly suspects that Russia's involvement in Syria - specifically, where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is they want to be energy brokers, just as they are in eastern Europe, southern part of Europe", he reported.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the capability, with our Navy, to keep the seaway open, and, if necessary, to put up a blockade, to make sure that their energy cannot enter the market", he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at an event hosted by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He compared the approaches Washington has taken in dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that in terms of effectiveness, they are similar.
"The economic choice in Iran and Russia is more or less, to use and replace the fuel", he said, referring to Russia as one of the "experts in that field" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
This statement comes as Trump administration representatives are on a mission to increase their LNG exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the "unwarranted" Nord Stream 2 oil refinery pipeline project, which Trump says makes Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 refinery project, designed to double the existing refinery pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin denies that Washington's strong opposition to the project is solely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be used as a tool to exert pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own supplier", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US stance has drawn a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would be in big trouble if a third country interfered with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "look at the situation" when she runs for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "take a glimpse of the situation" when running for president after the midterm elections.
While campaigning in the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, including putting women in top positions", as she told The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will review the situation when I run for president".
Warren compared herself to President Donald Trump while campaigning at city hall, saying that she "led this region in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren was outspoken in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we can vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday, showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents did not want him to run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent support the nomination.
The poll showed even more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting his possible candidacy and 48 percent opposing it.
Other prominent names in the Democratic Party being discussed in connection with a possible 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD track Palin during the Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the Army in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son went through, what he's going to go through when he returns, I can relate to other families who are also feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers have suffered", he told an audience at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the capture like "the elephant in the room" and told of her son and other war veterans, "They came back a little different, they came back harder, they came back and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and airmen and every other military member to the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with a domestic violence offense against a woman, coupled with reports of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supporting a challenge to the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia supported legal challenges to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from these 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
He said his partner "and his son, who is a member of a violent gang", had harassed him, but U.S. officials denied his asylum request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace portray El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers for the U.S., as countries facing big problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy runs counter to a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims must be decided on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances relating to the claim, and such prohibition violates the principle", the friend-of-the-court brief said.
The prosecutors further gave a brief opinion that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, saying that they are more likely to become employers and "provide the necessary labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered an immigration judge to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear caused by issues of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group, or political opinion", Sessions said in announcing the policy on June 11.
Sanctuary is not meant to alleviate all the problems -- although all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
The rescue effort was very sad in Palu because the casualties doubled as the race against time to find the surviving victims
For those who survived, the situation was even more dire.
"It was very stressful", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she soothed her infant son who was running a fever at a refugee center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance comes with the bodies.
Clean water is very rare".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, retrieving flooded items, trying to salvage whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, the damage caused by the 7.5 earthquake was devastating.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken spine and shoulder, lay outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated out of doors for a strong aftershock.
Tears flowed as he recounted how he felt when the earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save himself.
I think I'm stuck in the rubble of the wall", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then I stopped.
I don't know her condition and my son.
May they live".
US ambassador accuses China of 'intimidating' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after China's official newspaper ran a four-page ad in a US daily citing the reciprocal benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the biggest selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on Nov. 6, an accusation that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election, which marks what US officials told Reuters, is a new phase in Washington's increased campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war, which has seen them raise import tariffs on each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war are designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former longtime governor who heads Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and business people.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is now doubling down on the intimidation by running propaganda ads in our own free media".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is capitalizing on America's cherished tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by placing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"Instead, in the street newsstands here in Beijing, you will find a restriction on different voices and will not see a true reflection of the different opinions that Chinese people may have about the trajectory of China's troubled economy, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media outlets in China declined an offer to publish" his article, though he did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are excluding women voters ahead of the midterm election with the Kavanaugh debacle.
As the scaffolding of Republican luminaries stands and defends Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions on this issue are high, and most Republicans on record have already indicated they want to advance on the ballot.
It cannot be prevented", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push for an FBI investigation would be enough to soothe anger in the electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, and they will not forget it in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is near!" as they demonstrated in the Senate hallway as Republicans took control of the Judiciary Committee to continue advancing Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Enthusiasm and motivation for democracy will be off the list", nonpartisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
"People say it's quite high; and it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who because they don't like the president, often don't vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the sexual abuse of himself by the Supreme Court nominee, analysts warned of a backlash that would follow if Republicans pressed him to move forward with a confirmation.
"This is going to be a mess for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about committee elections or final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans are handling this issue and how they're handling it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided over who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more favorable choice for the latter.
A new poll conducted by YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents actually believe or may believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they actually believe or may believe Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh may or may not have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake's urging, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that a drunken Kavanaugh assaulted him when he was 17.
Ramirez said the Supreme Court nominee showed her his penis at a party they attended while attending Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that was trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open-source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to start now", he said from the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
This storage can contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify which are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about this private online data storage is that it's really up to the user who can access what kind of information.
In the corporate world, it's known as "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company brings the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Today the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change where all their business models would be completely turned around overnight.
"We did not ask for their permission".
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide the energy and commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: commemorating the WW1 clergyman with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant, is commemorated in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the raids at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said this stone was a "symbol of intelligence" that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather's award-winning achievements.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog under a barrage of fire from field guns and machine guns".
He then rushed forward to the battle line and with "greatest courage" led the front before rushing to use field guns alone and crippling three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I knew I couldn't live without and it was a very humble act".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to play a part in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown by the support that many will give".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine this, you've been up all night to watch a packed Bellator 206 only to be denied a chance to watch the main event.
The bill from San Jose contains 13 fights, including six in the main card and is being broadcast live all night long in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, the British audience was stunned when his appearance was transformed into Peppa Pig.
Some feel unappreciated after staying up late on the day of the fight.
One Twitter fan described the switch to children's cartoons as "a sick joke".
"It's government regulation, that at 6 a.m. the content is unfit for air, so it's replaced with children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the pig", yes.
Bellator president Scott Coker said that they will improve their scheduling by taking into account the UK audience in the future.
"I think if we think about recycling, I think we might be able to do it", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock there on Sunday morning and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, in the shift, there's a lot of text back and forth and it's all uneducational.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical error.
No, it's a government issue.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We're going to cut down to five fights out of six fights -- as we normally do -- and we're going to try to avoid over-specting the fans, and we've succeeded.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley feels 'underrated' when it comes to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a low self-esteem because of his sexuality issues - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize it until he entered high school, that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the right of gay people to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent made him not so concerned with winning the Olympics.
The regular host of this long-running show, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off because of illness.
Appearing as the outcasts on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "less than" all the other people she grew up with because "it's not socially acceptable to like men and women".
She said, "To this day, that feeling of being less than, and being different, has been the very thing that gives me the power and the strength to succeed".
She wanted to prove that she was "something", she said, so that she wouldn't disappoint everyone when they found out about her sexuality issues.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT campaigner and used her performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries not to discriminate against gays.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, and he says the age gap is not a problem.
"When you have so many problems at such a young age" - she took part in her first Olympics at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she said it was very difficult to find someone of the same age who had the same ups and downs.
The couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I should win the gold medal'", he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than just winning an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for the London 2012 Olympics - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to sit in the front row of the most dads'," he said.
"Holding his hand as he stopped breathing and still not really stopping breathing until he died, I finally admitted that he was invincible", she said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I've dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of a crowd at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling than that", he said.
It also inspired her first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which had already joined her in her preparation for the Olympics and still made her shiver.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast that airs on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson switched roles when he was booked for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golfer Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays in the 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change roles to avoid an unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who was playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was reserved by captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball and group four games on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually does for the United States, the five-time major winner divides his time between being a cheerleader and doing his part on the pitch, hoping to fix what has been bothering him.
Never the most straight-edged golfer at the height of his career, the 48-year-old was ill-suited to the rigorous course at Le Golf National, which routinely handed out long and harsh penalties for every wrong shot.
And for his own turf, not scary enough for Mickelson, in his ninth match on Sunday, facing the very accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If this American golfer, starting 12 singles with four points down, starts with a hot start, then Mickelson's game is proving to be very important.
Furyk expressed his faith in this man, not because he could say so much else.
"He really understood his role today, patting me on the back and hugging me, and saying he would be ready for the game tomorrow", Furyk said.
"She was so confident.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's given so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagine the other, but that's the way it plays and that's the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy a different environment, just like most people".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played, on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career which will never equal his individual record height.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence brings some things that cannot be said for the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and he's the cool guy in the team room", she explained.
"I think the younger players have fun with it, this week too, which is quite fun to watch.
He gave so much, more than just playing".
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows a great advantage can soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, learned from experience that someone who leads big enough to his last singles match in the Ryder Cup can easily be a no-good ride.
The Dane made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderrama, with team captain Seve Ballesteros holding a five-point advantage over the Americans, but had just touched the finish line with their nose by the thinnest of margins, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we got a big lead at Valderrama; we got a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but just recently", said Bjorn, taking a picture, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you're going to enter a really boring game.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that goal is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've said for a long time, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side - the greatest players in the world".
Delighted to see the players playing on the hard course, Bjorn added: "In this I will never advance on my own.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, the individual players will advance, and this is a different thing to do.
It's nice to be out there with a partner when everything's going well, but when you're out there playing solo, then your full potential as a golfer is tested.
That's the message you have to give to all the players, to bring out the best in you for tomorrow's game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go and bring out the best in himself".
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his players to play better individually than they did as a team, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself had been on both ends of the turf on the final day of the big game, having been part of the team that won at Brookline before ending up defeated when the Europeans performed the "Miracle at Medina".
"I remember every word of it", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players on the final day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start them as fast as you saw them at Brookline, as you saw them at Medina.
When momentum goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a roster and put people in different ways that we felt, you know, we were trying to do magic tomorrow".
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the opposition against Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players in the top spot.
"I went with this group of people in this order because I felt I could close all the roads", Bjorn said of his single choice.
The new German battleship is delayed again
The newest German Navy patrol vessel was supposed to have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era battleship, but the ship won't be there until at least next year because of a faulty system and its rising cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class guards, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery issues have disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will come as replacements for the aging Bremen-class guards.
The vessel will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic key removal.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it should be possible to use the latest patrol vessel for two years away from its home port.
However, the continuing delay means that this advanced warship - which is said to allow Germany to project its power abroad - will be obsolete by the time it enters its service life, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated escort ship F125 made headlines last year, when the German Navy formally declined to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after it was shipped.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return of the ship, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless for combat missions.
The software glitch was particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half the manpower on the older Bremen-class battleships.
It is also known that the ship's weight is so excessive that it will reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice the weight of ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the production costs of the entire project - including the training of the crew - were also a problem.
It is said to have risen to a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the original €2.2 billion.
The issue of the latest patrol vessel is of particular concern given the recent warnings of a dwindling German naval force.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "running out of ships with a dispatch capability".
The official said that as time goes on the problem grows, as the old ships are no longer in use but there are no replacements available.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class escorts could join the Navy.
The National Trust secretly listens to the bat's secret life
New research is being conducted on a plantation in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that these findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common pipistrelle and sopran and the long-eared brown bat and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be conducting mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An audio expert who analyzes all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be created to create landscape-scale images detailing their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor for NTS, hopes this will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine what benefits are derived from habitat management work such as creating grasslands and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and across England has declined sharply in the last few centuries.
The bat is threatened by development work affecting its nesting and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper hanging for bats and the chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because of its nocturnal habits, its ears are more useful than its eyes in catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to precisely locate insects and obstacles in their flight paths.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres [76 000 ha] of land throughout the country, is particularly concerned about bats.
It has ten trained professionals, who routinely conduct surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes rescue efforts.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only nature reserve at Threave plantation in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Plantation manager David Thompson says the plantation is a good habitat for bats.
"Here at Threave, we have a good area for bats", he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees, and all the good habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive".
He stressed the importance of checking bats before doing any breeding on the property, since the unintended destruction of a single mating nest could kill up to 400 females and young, potentially wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and killing, harassing, or disturbing, or destroying their nest is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
He said: "We have much to learn about our bats and for many of our species we do not yet know the fate of their populations".
Ronaldo, who denied the rape allegations, is preparing a lawyer to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news", and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will be suing the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was later alleged to have paid him $375,000 to keep him quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no. I was just thinking about it.
What they're saying today is fake news", this five-time Ballon d'Or winner says on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's a common thing.
They want to be famous by calling me names, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "reporting of suspicion in the area of privacy unacceptable", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said he would seek compensation as "moral compensation in an amount commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reported back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to a report filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo kneeled down after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good guy" who disappointed only "one percent".
The documents say that Ronaldo admitted that the two had sex, but it was on a voluntary basis.
Mayorga also said he went to the police station and had his injuries treated at the hospital, but later agreed to settle the matter out of court because he was "afraid of retaliation" and worried "of being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to call off the peace settlement because she is continually traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time the attack was alleged, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of its car manufacturers
Britain "will regret forever" losing its status as the world's leading car producer after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added "to complain" Toyota, the UK has told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delaying the border if there is no deal, would be detrimental to Brexit in terms of labour costs.
The factory in Burnaston - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported across the EU.
"My guess is that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will see a shutdown in our manufacturing", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed their concerns about leaving the European Union without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem associated with what the carmakers are saying is the supply chain risk of no deal with Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on the principle of "on time" production, with parts coming in every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's supply at its factory in Derbyshire, company representatives said, and thus production will be halted.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "properly calibrated to avoid checks at the border".
"We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that will also allow what I'm saying not just to enjoy success at this moment, but for us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence is not just from Toyota but from other manufacturers as well, that we really should be able to continue what has been a very well-functioning supply chain".
Toyota cannot say how long production will be stopped, but it is clear in the long run, warning that cost increases will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and will ultimately be detrimental in terms of labor costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union manager of Unite at the factory, says that members are increasingly worried: "In my experience, once this job is gone, there's no going back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a proper and sensible plan for our future relationship with the European Union".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" as the battle for supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump would fire the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller's freedom, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed using telegrams to record conversations with Trump and possibly ousting the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who has accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, which subsequently delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was appearing on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for the meeting has not been set, it could be this week, I can see that pushing it back to another week would be good also considering the other things that happened in the high court.
But we'll see, and I always like to give the press the latest news".
Some reporters would dispute that statement: Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asks why.
Sanders said the rarity of the meeting was not due to a dislike for TV reporters "who are trying to get attention", though, he said: "I disagree with the fact that they are trying to get attention".
Then he proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The president is doing more direct Q&A sessions than the previous president", he said, adding without citing evidence: "We've seen those numbers".
The meeting will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it's going to replace the press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump routinely asks questions as he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
A solo press conference is a rare occurrence.
This week in New York, the president may be making his case, making a loose and sometimes bizarre appearance before the press gathered.
Health secretary writes a letter to EU workers in NHS Scotland about concerns over Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and hope they will still be working here after the Brexit troubles.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent the letter in less than six months before Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has committed to cover the costs of applying for permanent status for EU citizens working in the public service who are relocated.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on this withdrawal are still ongoing, approaching the decision expected this autumn.
But the British government has also prepared for the possibility of a no-deal scenario.
I know this must be very upsetting to all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of health services, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we would very much like you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of the Tennesse reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the end of the period.
"He came to the edge of the field and collapsed there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further evaluation.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/grade of injury suffered" and the State of Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before being sidelined, bringing his total tackles for the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, with the extra money to be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plan
This move will slow down the success of Corbyn's movement in attracting young voters.
This stamp duty increase will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department estimates it will raise up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in Britain - along with additional money to be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This move will be seen as an attempt to slow the pace of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high incomes.
The stamp duty increase would be imposed on individuals and companies who don't pay taxes in the UK, along with additional money that encourages the Government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The surcharge - which is an additional charge on the current stamp duty, including the higher rate introduced two years ago on second-home purchases and purchases for rent - could be as high as three percent.
The Treasury Department expects this move to rise to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-British residents, which has led to price hikes and made it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to get their foot in the door.
Many of the country's rich areas - usually in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a week after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people have their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to ignore quotas for affordable housing to correct Britain's "housing shortage".
Corbyn has announced a series of exciting housing reform proposals, including rent control and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He also wanted to give the council greater authority to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I promised that I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy houses as easily as hardworking British citizens.
For many people the dream of owning a home is a distant one, and the indecent treatment of the homeless remains a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead the Scottish team'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "chief ambition" was to manage Scotland at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who are currently third in League One, three points clear of the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to defend my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's it", Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and often watched the Scottish team at Hampden with my father as a child, and it was always something that attracted me to go back.
However, the opportunity will come, if I succeed in the management of the team".
Sunderland managers before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio, who was also a member of the club's first team.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of big names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured by 'can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities that exist in this club, there is no doubt to be in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task to be there, but I'll probably only see myself as a success here, if I can get this club back there".
Ross's career in team management was only three years, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton, and spending 15 months on the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to third place, and turn St Mirren from the brink of relegation to winning the Championship title the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"This may be the crossroads I'll have to go through", he recalled as he took over Alloa.
"I really believe management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I'm doing well, making a decent living, and enjoying some decent things.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of stuff you have to go through every week.
I'm still experiencing it in terms of the stress of the job, but in terms of management it feels good.
I always wanted to lead something and now I'm doing it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever had in my entire adult life".

The survey found that the best time to drink beer is 5:30 on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted the revenues of pubs across the UK that are struggling to survive, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that the pub and bar group saw sales rise by 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant, who compiled the figures, said: "The sun shining brightly and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup mean that July will follow the same pattern as the previous June, in which pub revenues rose by 2.8 percent, except for the restaurants that got a hard hit.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business in June will be worse in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks are so far the strongest performers compared to the declining restaurants.
Pubs selling food also suffer from the sun's heat, though not as much as restaurant operators.
Looks like people are just out for a drink.
Sales across all pubs and managed bars selling drinks rose 6.6 per cent for the month, with those selling food down three per cent".
Paul Newman, a RSM hospitality and leisure analyst, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since April.
Weather and the impact of large social or sporting events remain the biggest factors affecting sales in the out-of-home market.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, although a 4.8 percent year-over-year drop in sales would be painful on top of the ongoing cost pressures.
The long summer should not come at a time when the food vendors are having a bad time, and time will tell whether the fairly good temperatures we have enjoyed in August will provide the needed respite".

One in five kids have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
Surveys reveal that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of the "fake Insta" page
This news has raised concerns about her posting of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have created a social-media account that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they operated a "major" account that had been cleared to show to parents, while also having a personal account.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager asking others to "rape me".
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep a personal account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "This is disturbing so many teenagers who are trying to create online spaces that their parents and teachers can't find".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletic Council.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of governors.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie describes the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his experience at the international level over the last few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout the Scottish, British, and world athletic community and we believe athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly by having her on board", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I act as a voice for the athletes and I hope to really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American track and field athlete, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter sprints at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among his total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC pundit, is now unable to walk after suffering a momentary ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago today I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said that only time would tell if I could recover and to what extent.
It was a very tiring job to get back to full strength, to learn how to walk again, and today to do an agility exercise!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Breast pump ads comparing mothers to cows have divided opinion online
Breast pump companies have divided opinion online with an ad that compares a breastfeeding mother to a cow being milked.
To mark the launch of what is billed as "the world's first silent wearable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a music video joke to show the freedom this new pump gives to express a mother.
Four mothers danced in a barn filled with cow hay to a song that included lyrics such as: "Yes, I'm blushing myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice this is not a nipple, this is my breast".
Continued with the refrain: "Pump out, pump out, I feed them honey, pump out, pump out, I milk my woman".
However, the ad, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it has created a "panic" in the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows also have to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless their babies are stolen from them within a few days of giving birth", someone wrote.
Elvie's breast pump fits perfectly into her nursing bra.
Another comment: "The trauma that can be understood is good for the mother and the baby.
But why not use it to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have to take care of their babies?"
Another added: "An ad that lost its meaning".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "funny".
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'd buy it if I was breast-feeding.
Blackmail makes me feel exactly like a cow.
The commercial was a little crazy, but I'll take it.
"This is a product of genius", wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad targeted at moms who are squeamish (often at their work or toilet) and who feel like "cows".
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all feel like dancing with hidden pumps tucked inside their bras.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the insight of many women who are breastfeeding who say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, with no wires or tubes and fits inside a nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to move around, carry their baby, and even go out while squeezing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Elvie's pump is a pioneering product that deserves to be launched with conviction and provocation.
By equating the image between expressing women and dairy cows we want to pump the milk and all its challenges and constraints, and show it in a way that is entertaining and fun with the full freedom that the new pump brings.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children are moving quietly into tent camps on the Texas border
The number of migrant children being detained is increasing even though monthly border crossings remain unchanged, in part as a result of harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it difficult to sponsor children.
Basically, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants, and they're afraid of jeopardizing their own ability to stay in the country by stepping up to save the kids.
The risk increased further in June, when the federal government announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor a displaced minor.
The agency later determined that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the sponsors or members of the sponsoring association are in the country illegally, and most of them are malicious aliens.
That's why we keep hunting those people", said Mr. Albence.
Aiming to process children more quickly, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which had been the previous standard, shelter workers said.
Most of them appear via video conference calls, not face-to-face, to plead their legal status cases to immigration judges.
Those deemed unworthy of help will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are held, the more likely they are to be anxious or depressed, resulting in an increase in violence or escape attempts, shelter workers and system reports have said in recent months.
Lawyers say the concern is heightened in larger facilities like Tornillo, whose signs in a struggling child tend to be overlooked because of their size.
They said that moving children to a camp town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate the trauma that has already been so much fought.
Syria calls on 'occupying forces' from the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are occupying Syrian territory illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with appropriately".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem asserted that "the war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than a million fleeing their homes.
He asserted that Damascus will continue "fighting this holy battle until we clear all of Syria" of terrorist groups and "illegal foreign troops".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, specifically training and influencing Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem insisted that they should return immediately, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading an extraordinary fear" that encouraged refugees to move further away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue".
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement was agreed between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevents a massive attack by the Russian-backed Syrian army in the province, where three million people live.
But Moualem insisted that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and raised hopes that military action would target the mujahideen including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which "will be crushed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to create a post-war law for Syria and pave the way for a general election.
Moualem outlined the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, insisting that the panel's work should be limited "to reviewing the provisions of the current Law", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
By that logic, Trump will win the general election again in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers hope, the impeachment and scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
No one doubts, "The most dramatic presidential end of all time!"
So far, there's no sign of fatigue for the spectators.
Since 2014, CNN's prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC's has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers on prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers on prime time.
"It's a passion that draws people in because of something that's not understood", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths In Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would give his voting rights to Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,'" Miss Scovell told me.
There's an entertainment value in a mess.
Certainly, unlike any other TV show, the storyline emerging from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and restore the global economy.
A departure from that, a luxury that only the most privileged of spectators can enjoy.
However, it's not just being a knowledgeable citizen that at six o'clock you find yourself watching a panel of experts debate the use of Bob Woodward's "background" source for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 camel-skin bomber jacket ("thick clothes with a cocky, " The Washington Post quoted) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's gruesome description of Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of the policy he's doing is making it like a reality show that entertains you every night", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's (choosing to antagonize the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un) performing arts scene and daily storyline.

When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was hiding while watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He can't afford to exonerate himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh being prepared to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and then the Supreme Court on his balance.
"I remember when we had all these crazy shows that day and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right".

A lot of money from outside flooding the tightest midterm election race in the White House.
It's only natural that Pennsylvania 17 would get a flood of money, thanks to the redistricting of congressional districts that are pushing two incumbents in the same race for seats.
The newly reorganized Pittsburgh district, ran Conor Lamb of the Democrats - who won the seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb advanced against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old Pennsylvania District 12, which overlaps with the new Pennsylvania District 17.
These maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally Republican.
The contest in Pennsylvania's new 17th district has resulted in a campaign finance dispute between the major party's financial wing, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was becoming known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election that was publicly monitored for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been held by Republican officials for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political pundits are sending the Democrats a little higher.
U.S. considers sanctioning El Salvador for supporting China, then backs off
Diplomats confirmed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and booked a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to recall American diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalty was only considered against El Salvador, which had received some $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hurt the Central American country and raise unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings were taking place, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials insisted that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively ending the sentencing consideration for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to address the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the government's import of the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any new reprimands or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate as presented by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations regarding this uncertain situation.
Their statements were corroborated by outside analysts close to the government who also spoke out against this ambiguity.
What Is the Bible Teaching?
Another shocking story is the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice for Mr. Trump, for which there is now very important evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's report also discusses his investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in attacking our election.
If Congress does change hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable for himself, just as he prepares to go before the electorate again, and possibly end up on the jury of his peers.
So there is still much to be done, and I don't mean to suggest that the downfall of Mr. Trump's administration is inevitable - or its parallel in Europe.
There are choices we'd be better off making on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West would oppose him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the chance to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The beginnings of history center along such points of deviation, and accelerated or delayed democratic marches are inevitable.
Now the American people are facing some of these tipping points.
What are we supposed to do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversaw the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be secretly videotaped and argued that he was not fit to hold the presidency.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was wrong.
"How do we respond if the new FBI investigation Brett Kavanaugh has requested is incomplete or unfair - or if he is brought before the Supreme Court despite strong allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And besides, are we going to vote at halftime for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail that test, democracy will deteriorate in the long run.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a candle on a swastika-marked table.
By leaving that legacy to me, how could I lose hope for our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is feeling optimistic ahead of the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, armed with a win over Austria, following a good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will strengthen their position to escape from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept central midfielder Graham Dorrans out of the first half of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he is confident the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to a bigger goal.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal is a great team", said the 31-year-old.
"In this game we are confident of getting something and going away with a point.
In the end, we might be able to do it but, in our opinion, a draw might be a fair result.
In the first half, they might have been better, but in the second half, we got up and became a better team.
Stepping on Thursday, tonight is another big European day.
We hope to bag three points although it will be a difficult game because they had a good result in their last game, but, with the support of the fans behind us, I'm sure we can continue to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year, we had a difficult time, because of what happened with my injury and the changes in the club itself but now there is a very good hope in this club.
This squad is good and the kids are really enjoying it. It's good practice.
May we now grow, put the past behind us and achieve success".
The woman can't sleep because she's afraid of her pension
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they would like to be treated, few discussed the matter with their family members.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study discussed long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10 percent of them said they discussed this with their children.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no movement to start that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
This is where it starts.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your own family to provide care if you do not communicate your wishes first.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you will get treatment, for your choice will be very important in determining the cost.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can certainly help you with how to pay for these expenses.
The financing you choose for long-term care includes traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid cash insurance policies that cover these costs or insure yourself with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal documents: Face the legal debate that's coming.
Appoint your healthcare authority immediately, someone you trust to ensure your healthcare and ensure that your wishes are fulfilled by professionals when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, a power of attorney in your financial matters should also be considered.
You should choose someone you trust to handle all your financial decisions, besides making sure your bills are paid in case you can't afford them.
Keep in mind every little detail: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and on the way to the hospital.
Are you prepared to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Take note of such details so that you are ready to give an answer.
"It's not just the finances that are important, but who is the doctor?" Martin asked.

A man was shot by a wind gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a rifle on his way home from a night out.
The victim, who was in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot several times in the chest, abdomen and hands.
The shooting incident was described by the officers as occurring at around 02:30 BST, and was said to be a "random act".
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The injuries sustained by the victim are not life threatening and a number of witnesses have been called by the police.
An earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia
The devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday has killed at least 384 people, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The loss of communications has made it difficult for aid workers to get information from Donggala County, a district north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
Donggala, meanwhile, is a district covering more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic activity in the province of South Sulawesi is fishing and farming, especially on the Donggala coast.
However, nickel mining is also important in the province, although it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, just off the coast of Sulawesi.
Recorded in the last 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunami several times, according to data from Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami and hundreds of houses in Donggala were razed.
In 1996, nine people died in the tsunami disaster in western Donggala.
Seismically, Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and therefore earthquakes will occur regularly.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have struck in recent years are as follows:
2004: December 26, Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake, just off the west coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, claiming 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coastline, and more than half of those deaths were in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of similarly strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
On the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people are reported dead.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami off the southern coast that killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
The death toll was over 1,100.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 on the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, triggered a 10-meter-high tsunami that instantly destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya Regency, Aceh, also experienced a shallow earthquake and resulting destruction, as well as panic from people who remembered the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
Although this time there is no tsunami potential, more than 100 people died due to the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, dubbed the tourist island, also experienced a major earthquake that killed more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily sheltered thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's stepson arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on suspicion of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Police report released Saturday.
According to police reports, when a woman's acquaintance attempted to call the police to report an alleged crime, he confiscated her phone.
Palin was handed over to Mat-Su Pre-Trial Detention, on a $500 fine without bail, as reported by KTUU.
As the news network reported, Palin attended the hearing on Saturday, declaring herself "not guilty, as sure as she is" when asked about her defense.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could land him in jail for one year and a $250,000 fine.
In addition, he was also charged with a Class B felony, with a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
For Palin, criminal charges aren't the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
It was her own mother, Sarah Palin, who called the police to make a report of the alleged assault.
The case is currently being appealed to the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of a domestic violence felony report, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, also related to the incident.
Her boyfriend accused her of punching her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by a veterans' group for attributing her son's violence to PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of victims killed
On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a powerful earthquake that left at least 384 people dead.
An earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale, with the potential to trigger a tsunami, has leveled thousands of homes.
Power and communications are down, and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The quake struck central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos showing the devastation of the moment are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when the tsunami tore the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in the New York City terror attacks.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terror attack, which killed eight people -- a rare and unprecedented federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly committed assault by ramming a truck he rented from Home Depot into pedestrians and cyclists on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors had to provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, based on a statement of intent to impose the death penalty, filed with the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both charges are capital.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury convicted Saipov of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in the commission of racketeering, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, as well as counts of assault and attempted destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutor, the attack required "substantial planning and preliminary maturation", as Saipov's depiction of the crime was done with "gross, brutal, and savage brutality".
It was stated in the will, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, harm, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims in the incident were Argentinian tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last dropped a death penalty suit.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of murdering two drug suppliers, was finally sentenced to life in prison.
The last execution in New York federal court was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple found guilty of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse as the days and months passed after the attack.
When questioned by investigators, he said that he was pleased with what he had done, police said.
Saipov also told authorities that the attack was inspired by ISIS videos he watched on his phone, as indicted.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, expressed "clear disappointment" with the prosecutor's decision.
"In our view, the decision to execute rather than accept a guilty plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of the people involved in the incident", Patton wrote.
Earlier, Saipov's defense team had appealed to the prosecutor not to impose the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage called for 'the mobilisation of the people's army' today in protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should 'feel the heat' of Eurosceptics - as one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested they should take part in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bone told a street rally in Birmingham that Britain 'should be out' now if Farage were Brexit Secretary.
However, the challenge May faces in reconciling her divided seat has been underlined by Remain Tories supporters who joined separate protests denouncing Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise plan on track amid the onslaught of Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The Allies stressed that he would be pushed forward to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the backlash - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to decide between his package of proposals and the 'chaos'.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave crowd in Solihull that he wanted to 'get rid of the Chequers.
The proposal is that Farage should appoint a partner to take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he's still in charge, we'll be out of here by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I am ready to stand for Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers".
His words, while showing his opposition to the EU: "We are not fighting the world war to be subservient.
We want to have our own laws in our own country.'
Bone dismissed the suggestion that public opinion has the potential to bring about change since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British public's mind has changed and they want a settled condition is not true at all".
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who also joined the mass action, told reporters: 'Simply put, I want to say: Prime Minister, listen to your people.
Chequers is not popular with the public, while the Opposition will not vote for him, because it is not popular with our party and our activists who are so passionately taking to the streets and we are elected in the first place.
Our plea, put Chequers away and start listening to us.'
In a message addressed to May, he added: "Prime Ministers hold their jobs when their promises are kept".
Farage said that the demonstration of politicians should be 'held in the heat' if they want to overturn the 2016 referendum.
"What is most valuable at this moment is the trust between us - the people - and our political circles", he said.
'They tried to deny Brexit and here we are today, telling them that 'we will not let you do that.'
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: 'I want you to make our political circles, which are preparing to deny Brexit, feel the heat too.
We are mobilizing the people of this country who will win us Brexit and will never give up until there is a United Kingdom that is independent, self-governing, and proud.
Meanwhile, a mass of Remainers moves through Birmingham before staging a two-hour downtown rally.
A line of activists appeared to be waving the banner of the Tories Against Brexit after they staged their rally this weekend.
His Labour colleague, Lord Adonis, mocked the Conservative group over the security of their party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who told us that they could get the IT system and all the technology for Canada, whatever, for the sake of an anti-crisis border, in the framework of unlimited free trade in Ireland", he added.
What a comedy show.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren is planning a "serious coup" in the presidential race.
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "bump into the presidential race" after the November election moment.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic party declared its future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has frequently criticized President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against state GOP representative Geoff Diehl, the vice chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he has been branded as a Trump opponent in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's meeting in Holyoke was the 36th with his constituents, held in a town hall format since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to enter the Washington circle to restore our broken government, and that includes women in leadership".
The perpetrator of the Sims shooting, an LSU player, has been apprehended.
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced the arrest of a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player at LSU, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. ET during a news conference.
They released video of the shooting on Friday, in which an identified man is seen asking for help as seen in the footage.
Friday morning, Sims, 20, was found shot and killed near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde was protecting his friend, and Simpson fired a gun at him.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being at the scene, holding a firearm, and firing it at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any resistance and was thrown into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6'6" junior, growing up in Baton Rouge, that's Sims, has played in 32 games with 10 starts this past season and is averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after the team admits victory over Sebastian Vettel
It all became clear as Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton in qualifying on Saturday that would bring the Mercedes team command a big role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good starting position and almost left Hamilton as he maintained his position in the first two turns and pulled Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to go into the pits and let Hamilton move in in the tight end, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes pitched one lap after him and out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to race after a series of chase-ups that showed the reluctance of the Ferrari driver to leave the interior empty at the risk of surviving after the double move to hold on to the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race as he held off the tyre changes to target a quick finish and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth.
He finally got into the pits on lap 44 but was unable to improve his pace for the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen eventually took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man let me go.
The team has done an incredible job of having one or two", Hamilton said.
That's some bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday, urging her not to leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court Justice-elect Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the statement Ford made before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on what was going on in the senate that showed people were "evil and lewd and dishonest".
"Something that can happen and something beautiful is happening over the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and lewd and dishonest", he said.
"When you see the explosion and the leak then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I did not do it".
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't leak it".
All right, hold on a second.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak it", he added, as a senator's impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh last July, and it had leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak was from his office.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak the story", Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as he asked".
But his rejection was apparently not approved by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, that's really very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the nominee for chief justice, who has been accused of sexually abusing three women, the president is impressed with the notion that Democrats are using the allegations to their own advantage.
"They are determined to seize power by any means.
You see the evil, the rage, they don't care who they hurt, they have to walk for power and control, the Mediaite reports on the president's speech.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the rest of the world
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for their defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the home game 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants have a two-goal lead after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home side to a balanced field before Dwyer returned the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to catch up and finally prevail to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning three games in the previous game.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 of the game from a pass by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford delivering a pass when Beauvillier managed to double the lead four minutes later.
In a tight opening period, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game in the 13th minute before Matt Marquardt was the go-between for Cownie's equaliser in the 15th minute.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead at first period when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The hosts rallied and Bouchard once again balanced their position with a power play goal in the 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time at the end of the second period and he secured the win with his team in fifth during the final period.
The Giants, who have so far suffered four defeats from their five matches, are at home to face Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers left to ensure hundreds of passengers aboard the plane survived the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after his death for ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to shake the region and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their safety, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at a shaky control tower at Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport, Palu.
He chose to stay to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he felt it begin to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for the Indonesian Air Navigation Service, said his decision could save hundreds of lives, ABC Australia news reports.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter made it to Palu.
"We are all saddened to hear this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the National Disaster Management Agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was difficult.
"The number of victims is expected to increase as many bodies are still buried under the rubble and many others are unreachable", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the national disaster management agency.
Waves that reached six meters had made Palu a rattling mudslide that led to a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carrying relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance is bringing in the dead.
Clean water is becoming scarce.
Mini-markets everywhere are being looted"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's been a tragedy, but it could get worse"
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Ready? This is CNN.
Indonesia earlier this year was also hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini reports one person missing after plane crash lagoon
The airline operating the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia said one person was missing, after earlier telling 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon, it was unable to identify a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said the remaining six passengers were hospitalized Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the US Navy both said the plane landed in a lagoon around the runway.
Some witnesses felt the plane overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"That's a really good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to crawl through waist-high water through the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He delivered the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a slight head wound.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen working nearby the repaired dock also helped the rescue using rubber boats to transport people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in PG-registered airline accidents over the past two decades but none of them involving Air Niugini.
Analysts have released a timeline of the night the woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors are holding Saturday in retrial of a man accused of burning alive a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined for the jury how he used cell phone records to compile the various movements made by the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was in the same location with Chambers on the night of his death, as opposed to the defendant's earlier statement, reported Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed the defendant's cell phone was in the same location as Chambers during that time, he argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and the police eventually demanded an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford attended the hearing on Saturday and he testified that he was out of town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecution asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency that Tellis brought up was his statement that he knew Chambers for about two weeks before the victim's death.
Cell phone records indicate they knew each other within a week.
Rowlett reports that after Chambers' death, Tellis sometimes deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased the victim from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would lead to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the hip hop spirit?
A hip-hop trio wanted to challenge the negative view of the genre by infusing their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claimed that the hip hop movement was moving away from its political message and into social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make the hip hop spirit popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through some artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?!
NY nanny suing couple for assault after issuing racist message
A New York nanny sued a couple for discriminatory assault after receiving an indirect message from a mother who complained and claimed that she was "another black person".
The couple denied that they were being called racists, and considered it more like "harassment".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her anxiety when she realized that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day on the job in 2016.
"I'm not a black man", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote her husband in a note.
Anyway, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, the "naughty" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that they had fired the nanny, who was a mixed African-American, for doing a dirty job and that she had preferred a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for her day's work and then taken home in an Uber.
Maurice is now demanding that the couple pay him compensation for the dismissal, and is seeking compensation of about $350 a day for a six-month period, in return for the nursing work he was originally supposed to do, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do something like that", he told the Post on Sunday, then added, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple countered claims that they were racist, claiming that Maurice's dismissal of the employee was a reasonable thing to do, they were afraid they couldn't believe it after offending him,
"My wife has sent something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists", Plasco's husband Joel told the Post.
"But would you allow your children to be cared for by someone you've loved, even if it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on then".
As wrapped in a "warming", Plasco said his wife had just given birth to her baby and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You'd go after someone in that condition?
That's not a good thing to do", the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to lash out at the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitude and logic.
Paddington's publishers are worried readers won't connect with the talking bear, a new newspaper reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was received, the letter explained.  It is very difficult to just talk without knowing the position she is in, reading it first before it is published.
It's funny to know as much as we do about the great success of Paddington".
Says his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspiring him with a children's book with a toy bear, was very optimistic about his work having been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was felt to be a "sweet memory" after his father's death last year.
To Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family", he added his father was quite proud of his success.
"He's a quiet guy, and he's not a cocky guy", she said.
"But because Paddington meant so much to him, it's like you have a child who has achieved something: you're proud of them even if it's not your entire effort.
I think he sees Paddington's success as such.
Although it was the product of his own creativity and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her by phone.
Upon landing, the daughter was immediately taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but doctors were unable to save her.
"Nad made a quiet call to say it was very bad that he was unlikely to survive", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying he was going to die in two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors had given him to keep his heart beating slowly was being used up and leaving his system.
He's been dead for a while while, and it's all been deadly.
I can just sit there and wait, understanding all this has been revealed.
I can't moan, or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold it all".
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers - unaware of what she had been through.
"No one knows", he said.
"My head is down, and tears are pouring from my eyes.
It's hard to explain, but on that flight I felt such a deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her".
The bereaved women posted suicide prevention cards on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones trying to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspirational messages and a number to call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any old person to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always say that her smile lights up the atmosphere".
But he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he killed himself.
"I have a constant concern that there will be a lasting effect", said Mrs. Davis.
Mrs. Davis made these cards, "to let people know that there are other people out there that you can reach out and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit and be quiet - you need to talk. 
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"She didn't say if she was feeling sad or depressed or anything", he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents he didn't look into their eyes or anything".
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to get through it: "It created a gap in the family.
It's separating us.
But we have to get through it and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future was in doubt when the FBI began its investigation.
"I think, if we actually get something like what he's asking for - an investigation that's limited in time, limited in scope - we might be able to bring a little bit of unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "break down" amid the impasse of the council's decision.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is all due to time.
The legislative election is five weeks away, on November 6th -- if, as expected, Republicans do poorly, they will be very weak in their chances of getting the person they want elected to the highest court there.
George W. Bush has been reaching out to senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him meets his wife Ashley, who is Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What happened after the FBI made their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It remains unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes across the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors anjlok under Kim
The number of people defecting from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a member of the Korean Block Party parliamentary group said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Most North Korean defectors were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have been greatly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on the delayed denuclearization negotiations.
This came after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to cooperate on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and in such a situation, it is impossible for us to unilaterally drop our weapons", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of hysteria, saying he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Opposition Leader Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally unsuitable to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't shake the thought that if a woman performed like that, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judicial Council Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusation that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In her opening statement, Kavanaugh was highly emotional, several times nearly screaming and having difficulty speaking when discussing her family and her high school years.
He also bluntly condemned Democrats on the committee, saying the charges against him were "an absurd and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he couldn't serve on the Supreme Court because he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and with his attitude toward Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi objected that she would try to impeach if she was approved, and if the Democrats got more votes in the House of Representatives.
"I'll put it this way -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to not only be on the Supreme Court, but also on the court where he's sitting now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the D.C. Superior Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the potential of Kavanaugh's ruling against the Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as she was seen as a conservative justice thinker.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for someone who is hysterical and biased to go up to the court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to deal with it.
It was an ethical vice, a rage for months and years, and he couldn't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, what do you think?"
She continued, "I was very much helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cries when she's angry, but developed a technique that meant that she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad as hell".
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are shed as an outlet for his anger partly because he is fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of my early work, in a male-dominated office, was one time crying with inexpressible rage, when my throat was grabbed by an older woman -- a cold manager who I always had a little fear of -- who dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and happy because they think they've succeeded".
Patricia Schroeder, who is a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the race, Ms. Schroeder, in great frustration, realized that there was no reason for her not to run for president.
"That was not a well-thought-out decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called it "Snow Princess and the Seven Dwarfs".
Being late to the campaign, he was behind in fundraising, and so he vowed he would not run unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a fight that ended in defeat.
He found that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to the man gave him only $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
As she spoke to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made fundraising so difficult and for targeting voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - making it difficult for her to speak.
"You might think I was too nervous", Miss Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my tombstone?
"She was crying"?""
How US-China trade competition might be good for Beijing
The opening round of trade rivalry between the US and China is heating up, and while the fight is far from over, the friction between the two countries may be good for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
A very significant increase was imposed this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion dollars (£150 billion) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods entering the US via China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, most recently by imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has been begging to match the US one-by-one, and the world's second largest economy is not going to change anytime soon.
Calling on Washington to back down is a gesture of goodwill, but publicly defeating the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards right, U.S. trade competition pressure could favor China positively in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing can create conditions that trigger economic movements in both countries is actually more dangerous than what observers have known before", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research fellow at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and offers help to rebuild the country that was destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress in fighting terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore them to their former glory.
The current situation is due to the voluntary return of refugees to countries they had to leave because of terrorism and sweeping economic decisions that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime will receive help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they would not accept aid or conditional aid from countries supporting the rebellion.
Europe has secured a Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup beating the US team by a final score of 16.5 and 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its lead as Danish team captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had been trying for most of the tournament, hit his tee shot to the water on the par-3 16th hole, conceding the loss to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shines throughout the round, becoming one of only four players to go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American athlete Jordan Spieth was beaten 5&4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the European with an overall win with a career-high 25.5 points in the tournament.
"I don't normally cry but I couldn't hold it in today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have my dick back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He gave the responsibility to his compatriot John Ram who beat legendary US golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I felt, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him grow up", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
The odd statistic by one of the best players of all time, having won 14 major titles just under Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend for the fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S.A. spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we were making Europe difficult.
We had a fight.
Respect to Thomas.
He was a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're gonna reorganize, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're gonna move forward.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to give respect.
We're outnumbered".
In breaking news, Red Tide is declining in concentration in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota.
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows an overall decline in Red Tide concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
