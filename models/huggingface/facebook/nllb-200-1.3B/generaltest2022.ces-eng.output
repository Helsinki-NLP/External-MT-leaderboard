The great Czech bad boy's coming back.
Pavel Francouz was drafted into the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old Plzeň native will be on the bench and could soon be in the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He was in the middle of the Vegas game, and he hasn't been on the ice since.
The incident occurred as the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to the other.
"Pavel French will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower body injury", the Denver Herald reported in early October.
His return to the NHL goalposts eventually lasted more than two months.
On a Sunday morning, U.S. time, he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed off his old form.
He's got 94.5% of the AHL's procedures.
The outlaw of the Pilsen hockey club wants to finally stand up and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had hip problems his senior year, and he didn't catch a single game in the shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL, Francisco has caught 36 games, his success rate is 92.3%.
Charles giving Camille a Christmas gown, William and Kate posing in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen as their Christmas wishes a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan.
Prince Charles also shared his wishes, using a photograph of his bride Camille helping to put on her robe at the races.
The British news channel BBC reported on its website.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress, and so is Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same shorts and t-shirt as Prince George and Prince Louis.
Who took the picture, William and Kate didn't say, it's not even clear when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photograph intended as a Christmas wish on a bundle of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk.
The image, which will serve as a Christmas wish, was also released by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot Racecourse in June.
Charles, wearing a cylinder and a robe, helps Camille to put on her robe, colored in harmony with the light dress.
Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdik denied it.
Prague  The criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-president of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr was supposed to have a million crown promised by Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He reported it to efotbal.cz, saying he had access to some of the police files.
The chairman of the board of the Virsov club, Jaroslav Tvrdik, stated that the red and white did not commit any corrupt acts.
The server has released a transcript of police interviews, which mainly feature Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential official of the Red and White was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the second league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Forensics reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbra had promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berber) was to be promised a million-dollar bribe by the officials of SK Slavia Prague for winning the league, the file server quoted.
A day later, according to the criminologists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board, Slavie Tvordić.
The file doesn't indicate if the police are still working on this information.
The firm denied any corrupt activity.
In the years 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in illegal conduct, have not sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and have not provided any financial performance to anyone in this regard,' the Reporting List said.
In the latter, Nezmar selectively insults some former players of Slavia dark skin and also slanders his former boss Tvrdiak.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was unleashed last October by a police raid on several places, including the Prague headquarters of the Czech Football Federation.
The highest ranking player in the affair is Berber, who no longer appears in any of the football features.
In mid-January, just like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are the larping cold war.
The guns will be new, but in principle of a worse type (the artillery men must be from an armored cabin and carry the bullets by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, Prague V3S has already been eliminated even by specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - very small, short-range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
We don't have any missiles. We manufacture them and export them.
PVO: medium - cold-aged, outdated; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I've got a rush right outside of town.
The river was crawling with weeds and causing crop damage, so I sat there.
When I came, I saw a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat there quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before anything came up, but of course, the fox left.
I let her come within 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
Poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his head all over the place, so I called him and told him it was a fox.
By the time I got off the premises, he was gone.
I mean, even a meadow can be a Prussian.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a series of coincidences to make something happen, you'd probably be seen in the thermal imaging that almost everyone has these days.
So, in a visible place, put your precious things in your sleeping bag and you should be fine.
The Wraith against the Hammocks.
Inside, they got respirators substantially cheaper than the Department of Health.
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of robes, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns in recent weeks to purchase them.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of the various ministries and found that during one day the amounts for the respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities have been thrifty?
And why did others buy the trail?
Lenka Kabrhel is speaking with the editor of iRozhlas, Dominica Kubištova.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I'm not struck by the memories of the CSLA that older generations have experienced), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from a forced war.
We don't even have large inventories of equipment that the training can take in, we don't actually have modern technology for existing professionals, and on top of that, modern technology is getting more and more complex, so the skills of the backup will be rapidly lost over time.
And the modern conventional conflicts, where you can deploy them, they're going to happen very quickly, there's no time to re-train anyone.
And finally, the backers/territorial defense are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where it's going to lead mass guerrilla warfare and it's also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
The only way to fight in the Czech Republic is in a conflict of such scale and intensity that the guerrillas are irrelevant, and we don't have the geography to do that.
We don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst part.
Worst part is, half of them are playing like they got it.
Then you're in a situation where you're watching a guy who didn't hit an empty goal two minutes ago, he's going into the attack alone between two or even three Swiss, and you're like, "Whoa, what do you think is going to happen now?"
Well, of course they'll take him like the average taxpayer.
This whole "get your defender" thing is so bad, I find myself frankly surprised to see our forward beating one of the other players.
The first strawberries
The COVID pandemic is slowing down, but experts don't expect a major turnaround in the coming weeks.
The swelling in hospitals, according to statistical models, will last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as you know: the Omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, to the extent that vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired from previous prolongation of the disease helps against it.
But this week, an unexpected plus-side phenomenon has also entered the COVID equation: the possibility of a cure.
A new antiviral drug, molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, reducing the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and making it possible to treat it at home.
And soon it will be joined by Pfizer's paxlovid, which has reported success rates of up to 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, have also highlighted the question of how prepared the administration is for incoming drugs.
As mentioned, the first to reach the domestic patients is Molnupiravir from Merck.
The company also ended up on the list first because the drug had begun development long before the current pandemic began, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for equine viral disease in South America.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not share their views openly.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to saying "how our beak grew".
See, you do a poll where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will say no.
In the West, they'll tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
He's afraid of cancel culture, saying that in public means losing his job and a media lynching.
Then it looks good in the polls, West good, East bad.
But it'll really find out what people are thinking.
It's just in France, Le Pen and Zemmour, both of whom have over 20 percent, according to the poll.
We even know that the objects are three in Czech and completely identical.
Identical for the sake of spinning units so soldiers don't have to re-learn where what is, so all the objects per hair are the same.
One is Brdy's Atom Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is, the USSR didn't want to have a nuclear warhead on its own territory either for safety or speed of deployment because of its more westerly location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only warheads were stored, not whole rockets as they say.
If this weapon needed to be deployed, a special unit would come and pick up the warhead and mount it on some portable device.
Except for the museum maple, the rest are in a state of desolation.
In the second grade of elementary school we had a fellow Gypsy, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he was often over the top, but he was our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, he went out often and wanted to explain things, he missed a little, he went out regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks, he didn't steal phones, he went out clean.
He went to nature schools, he did all kinds of monkey houses, but he was fine, never a mess.
In the eighth or ninth grade, they had siblings, gypsies in the same grade, different classes.
In short, they beat up the teacher, the police were often there, threatening and threatening other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for advertising (old things, things I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had money, they didn't try to get me on the price, communication was calm.
I even sold the car like this, the guy called a month later, said he'd already written it over.
I say for myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they belong in a decent society (work, work, don't beat women, just normal behaviour).
But when someone comes, reaches out, takes apartments and houses, makes a mess around, makes trouble... it doesn't matter what color they are, but I'll mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they join us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily English, at least), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be there for them.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatice.
"The young woman suffered multiple serious injuries and, despite resuscitation, unfortunately died on the spot", said Zuzana Fajtlova, spokeswoman for the South Bohemian Medical Emergency Service.
The driver who was driving the girl was probably responsible for the accident.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot probably drove in the direction from Žíchovec to Bavorov and, for reasons as yet unknown, made a wrong turn.
After a collision with a Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on the roof off the road, described the accident spokesman of the South Bohemian police Štěpánka Schwarzová.
A young Peugeot driver has suffered very serious injuries in an accident.
It was multiple injuries and he was left in the car chained.
After his release, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the Czechoslovak hospital in stable condition, said the paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to packages from outside the EU, often with customers not providing details
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He's mostly making collectible cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars up, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free", the collector approaches.
Since October, the price of small consignments has risen slightly, and he has to add VAT and submit data to customs by post.
He'll get an e-mail saying customs is expecting a package.
The VAT is then charged by the customs authorities on the total amount of the consignment and transportation, if the trader has not already included the VAT at the time of sale.
Where the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the transportation fee must also be added to the total amount.
But according to Lukas Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll click one or two of the trigger boxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
It's usually a matter of five minutes for me, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Because of new customs regulations, the daily number of international mailings received at the Prague International Post Office has dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests for the data needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 international mail shipments that we need to process.
If people filled in all the information they need and did so on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
The inflation solution
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We're currently at 9.9% inflation and expect it to continue to rise.
What do you think the government should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, in Poland, a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, so I think it's inevitable that people will not be able to afford the basic things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who's the employee)?
I've been given 2% gross this year, which is ridiculous, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run while I'm working.
Can someone please explain to me why convicted rapists are only sent to jail for six months?
I just can't get my head around how a court can send an animal like that to jail for just six months just to do it/and then again as soon as he gets out.
Six months is nothing compared to his/her victim having trauma for several years, negatively affecting his/her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Would that deter potential future reports of rape victims?
The man from the grave burned his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from the Grave unwittingly helped the guards secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was issued a warrant for her arrest.
He called them to it.
He went a little bit off the rails.
First he approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
Officers arrived at the scene after calling the emergency line and were not surprised when the alleged thief told them that he had made it all up to get the officers to the scene.
In fact, he was just asking the officers for advice on how to report the crime to the Czech police.
When they checked the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found that the woman was on a nationwide wanted list, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.
The case is therefore being handled by the PPR.
A sincere question to the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I personally believe that we Slavs are long gone ethnically and culturally, but I'd like to know your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, of course, it's a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA:')
Of course, I'm not denying that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's a question of whether a rational person can really believe in something completely without evidence just because it could potentially be beneficial.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true religion.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's an estimate, if I'm not mistaken, of about 10,000 different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should man choose?
I would say it's quite likely that in any of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
Yet, even in the tenth verse, it says that there is no god but Jehovah.
Would it not be more rational, then, to abstain from believing in any god at all, than to risk choosing the wrong one of thousands of gods, and the one true god, whom I have just missed, sending me to hell or some other place?
Other: Volunteer training followed by reserve.
The Swiss model is similar, I think.
X months of training (in different specialisations, X months per person) and under the guidance of professionals with practical experience.
If a man does well, he can get a professional offer.
All the ACR units could use something like this.
We could do that in cooperation with the Defense University.
We can say it like this: there's a constant mismatch between education and industry, companies are hunting in schools, and there's some sort of merger, where the workforce is migrating from education to employment.
Not just as we grow up, but this is a continuous process, each of us constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar interlinking should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build some kind of relationship between the citizen and the military, an institution that ensures that no Russian, German or even Mongolian invader ever comes here again.
I find it funny how you think NATO is something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there's any trouble.
Well, please, sir.
One election in the US, and they're gonna cut their budget, and NATO's gonna go to shit.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they can turn their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that can guarantee independence in the long term is a fully armed army and a population that can master the military technology of the time.
And today, they can pilot any teenage remotely controlled vehicle, so what's the point?
We don't need border fortifications, which sucks today, but a horny teenager with a remote control can handle it.
How to Avoid Drowning in a Box Tsunami
You unwrap presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're home with boxes and stuffing?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
So we created a map of the stores that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That's why it's a shame to treat them like disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating shop (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150) by agreement.
This will encourage small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome the shortage of packaging on the market and the money saved, as the price of cardboard has risen by 50% in recent years.
And I'm also making my brand stand out in the eyes of green-minded customers.
One such shop is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
The boxes and filling material are delivered to Popojvek near Brno by individuals who collect them at home, but we also receive communications from companies with whom we have arranged regular shipments of discarded cartons.
We'll use it to pack our e-shop shipments.
Together, individuals and companies are creating a more considerate world.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz application does not only show the collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to dispose of anything (where to take the sorted household waste, where to return the old medicines, tires, spent electricity, batteries, light sources, bulk waste, etc.).
All the waste can end up in the right place, and recyclable items can find a second home.
The project map already contains over 100 000 such places.
"Growingly, there are collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find uses for things that would otherwise be waste", adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the Clean the Czech Republic application.
I'm rather disappointed that technology is so simple and foolproof these days that kids who use computers or phones play games on them, but don't learn basic computer skills in the process.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because Google Photos or Apple's photo apps or mobile phones in general, they just hide the underlying file system with the folders and it all comes down to one screen in the app.
They can use the technology from their childhood, but they can learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU presidency last weekend, starting in January, and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans  at work, on the street  and mentioned so many events that in six months they could not be caught up.
French politicians like it, and voters like it.
Macron's supporters of the split between right and left will agree on a few things, but in Europe, they do.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar has also affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such historians' work.
Many commentators immediately criticized Macron for pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they're trying to prevent history from being rewritten.
The far-right candidate for French president, Éric Zemmour, is now touring France arguing that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is doing quite well with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't that be necessary?
Students in European countries are mostly learning history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs, they're finding out who's defeated who in what battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened clerk, they won't know what the wider context was.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Miši" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won awards for best director and best actress for Jasna Duričić.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held the top spot on the audience ladder.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for The Father.
I'm not too young, I'm not too fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "have the flu/be dead" I had diarrhea for a few days and I didn't feel like smoking...
It was worse than the flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying everyone has it)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double, which will be released on December 20, will include a traditional literary appendix.
And with it, the cultural tips.
We're adding the book to this digital edition for you subscribers, so you might have time to buy books as Christmas presents.
Prose texts that follow on from the previous similar collection by Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another portion of observing the world and describing everyday things with extraordinary poetic attention, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, photographer Šesták tried to capture the essence of the small town and Czech society.
A tale of a return to roots that turns out to be a wishful illusion.
Bohemian and Comparative brings the fairy tale of the Red Riding Hood to the backdrop of a contemporary village.
Its delivery surpasses the folk version in brutality and ranks in horror with emotional emptiness.
And that the road back to instinct is shorter than one is willing to admit.
The author, in his penultimate novel, tells a much less sentimental story of return from exile than we are used to hearing.
Those who stay and those who leave know too little about each other to live together.
Trains start running on new timetable, some carriers change
From Sunday, trains will start running on the railway under the new schedule.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some routes, for example between Usti nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts to run instead of Czech Routes.
For most lines, only the departure time, or even their route, will be adjusted slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The airlines started selling tickets in the autumn.
The Czech Railways plan to operate an average of 6783 passenger services per day on the new timetable, of which an average of 478 will be long-distance trains per day.
The trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new schedule.
The routes will run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland in addition to the national routes under the new timetable.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the Prague-Cheb lines.
The new trains will run in northern Moravia and western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year, on average by 3.2%.
The routes take inflation into account in their tariffs each year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry on the R23 route Ústí nad Labem  Mělník  Nymburk  Kolín.
The carrier will replace České dráhy after winning the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 daily flights, eight in each direction.
Further changes concern the long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express maintained its 16 routes, two return routes to Slovakia and also weekend routes to Krakow.
According to the spokesman Emile Sedlarik, the carrier tried to maintain as similar as possible the running times of its long-distance trains despite the planned lock-out work.
The Arriva and other carriers are expected to continue operating without major changes.
The carrier is also changed on some regional routes.
Changes await passengers, for example, in Českolipsko, where the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run instead of the Czech lines on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk.
Passengers will also be able to use the single railway ticket in the second year.
As with the Czech railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2%.
I must disagree.
Don't we learn the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how hard they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, they were dying.
I've never heard the teaching from the point of view of the slave party or since, nobody defends this, just condemns it.
Nobody in the schools tells you that blacks often sold blacks themselves into slavery and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one in school will teach you that the colonists often bought land from the Indians, they will tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans murdered them, killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, directly in schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern schools.
I've never met anyone who deliberately withheld facts, but I've heard it happen before, and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (for example, in Japan, WW2 atrocities are pretty taboo).
My point was more that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about your feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at the thing from the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never do this again.
By the way, speaking of the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave traders are quite popular there, but on the other hand, they had some good successes too, and I thought it was absurd to dismiss them.
Plus, the North wasn't much better than many people think it is these days.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slave, and they were also opposed to a lot of things.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, and maybe our view does not exist with them (on YT there was even a video from TV where they took out someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country never experienced.
And I found that, in general, it was quite shocking at some universities, that the students were quite radicalized, and the schools were very supportive of them.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I'm a little bit upset that this could be the majority vote, because it's among the young and even among the ruling elite.
I think maybe feminism has already achieved what it had and it's not about that anymore, it's radicalized.
Today, feminists are defined by those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT, and this leads to radicalization and the opposite, which often leads to resistance even to things that are quite reasonable.
Plus, the more radical someone is, the more they're heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I also didn't meet with anyone who judged me for colonialism or slavery.
I'm more of a bad geographer, but it was mutual:D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole to be unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If there's anything that connects me to people, it's interests, worldviews, and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not a religious person, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
That Slovak priest is a really nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some coronavirus bullshit, so everyone's ashamed.
Then, of course, there's the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born of the Catholic modern and are in fact Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to the Hussite services, because it's very similar theologically, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanical Street.
The Church of St. Michael in Dominican Square is owned by the Dominicans, and even there they hold Mass every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The Bethlehem flame is in the Czech Republic, the Scouts took it from Austria.
The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna this time because of the coronavirus pandemic, but picked him up from his Austrian colleagues at the Reintal  Břeclav border crossing in the morning.
They took him at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that the squad and I participate in every year, and I'm really looking forward to it.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, said the scout Amália Budíková to the press.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right on the border bridge, now at the Reintal  Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
But usually the scouts take the train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes on the delivery of the flame in the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally set off by train first to Brno, where they hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The next light distribution will be done by Scout couriers on Saturday, December 18, traveling in select express and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the lights at the stations, and then continue spreading the flame throughout the Czech Republic and beyond.
This year, the Scouts must continue to comply with the current coronavirus precautions.
It's the same as last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear uniforms, try to keep the gaps as low as possible, not to sing to colleagues, just behave as safely as possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, spokeswoman for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace along with the flame.
The light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope for believers, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts have been promoting it for more than 30 years.
The event is attended by hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All updates, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics degree, so I don't know the fundamentals of economics that say that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure development, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education are using the money properly, they just don't understand why the money is being given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned, it produces a useless product and it destroys the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million Xy-funded/co-funded billboards in the hallways and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not supporting a company that gives jobs to x people, this is a developmental brake when this company is holding out and taking contracts/employees from companies that could have grown and been more productive after its demise
I totally agree, it's awful.
Sometimes even a person born in the Internet age is caught in a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I think I'm not really into internet advertising, but then I'm caught up in it, and I'm just so freaked out that you can't help yourself.
For this reason, I support the radical votes in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to ban programmatic advertising altogether...
It's all bullshit, in the classic words - I'd ban the Internet.
I feel that this thread has its roots in (but mostly in point 1):
"I will not believe in something that the majority believes and makes sense, I am not a sheep, but I will rather believe in something that is less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion about which I will argue that it is critical thinking".
"I'm not going to believe everything the media says".

TVs have fallen behind the Christmas trend, with 200 premieres this year
Los Angeles  Cinema, television, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen behind the Christmas trend, with a record-breaking 200+ movies opening to audiences this year.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb movie database.
The Christmas family and romantic film genre has been gaining in popularity in recent years, and the number of such films has been increasing.
This year, there were four times as many Christmas movies as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has only included those movies that have the word Christmas in their name, so there will be a lot more Christmas movies.
The movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are associated with this period, and films are popular worldwide, such as Alone at Home, Love in Heaven or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
But the real boom in Christmas movies didn't start until 2009, when a special series of films came to the U.S. cable channel Hallmark, the BBC said.
Her adventure project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was a huge success.
This year, the channel began streaming its Christmas programming on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas movies.
The rival Lifetime channel has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms like Netflix are contributing to the total.
"In this magical time of year, the story doesn't matter much, the important thing is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing", said Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours amidst all the festive madness and the madness of the world we've been living in for the last few years", Gray added.
He says, for example, that Hallmark Television has been using the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then about half an hour before the end, there's some misunderstanding that gets resolved, and they kiss.
It's like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look the same and have the same vibe, people watch one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19, and he's not going to race until the final race of the season.
Only 19 drivers will compete in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not be racing until the final race of the season.
The Haas stable will send only one formula to the track.
In the final race of the season, he was to attack a better position from the 20th position, which he had taken in qualifying.
But the Russian Nikita Mazepin of the Haas stable will not interfere with the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only 19 cars will appear on the grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher from the last corner, and the first Max Verstappen, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
Mazepin is in fairly good shape, according to Haas's stable, and he's not showing any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved", her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not, and cannot, send a replacement rider to the race.
A possible replacement would have to qualify or ride at a different part of the weekend.
The first rider is not affected by COVID-19.
Kimi Räikkönen had COVID-19 at the start of the season, and last year, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
You could go to jail for this, too.

From a legal point of view, covid is on the list of infectious diseases.
So in the same group as HIV, plague, yellow fever or typhoid.

(3) A person shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of three to ten years if, by an act referred to in paragraph 1, he causes serious injury to the health of at least two persons or death.
(4) A person shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of five to twelve years if he causes the death of at least two persons by an act referred to in paragraph 1.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds, the price tag of the most expensive sweater will be amazing!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the designer put in six months of work and all his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn in my home", admits Lebanon, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in six months.
The silk was bought in Italy, the 24 carat gold thread in France, and 2,000 ornamental crystals were delivered by Swarowski.

The government has approved sending up to 150 troops to help Poland.
The women, explorers and drone pilots could be ready to go before Christmas, and the mission is approved for six months.
They're supposed to help their Polish counterparts with the border security with Belarus and the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested the assistance of NATO countries in connection with the actions of the Belarusian regime, which has been inviting citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory for several months, with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating in Poland.
The Omikron mutation is spreading in southern Moravia?
Hygiene is checking out another case of the Adam's baby.
We're currently reporting another suspected variant in another kid from Adam's, prep school.
No direct contact with previous cases from Adamov University has been proven, Ciupek said.
Six cases in the county in one week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases", said the director, "which is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Flu viruses of the National Institute of Health in Prague".
She added that the two nurses were from the same workplace, Brno University Hospital, and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old students of Adamov University of Applied Sciences.
There's no connection between the Brno case and Adamova.
Three of them have mild symptoms, four have no symptoms, according to the director.
No one with a suspicion of Omikron has ever traveled abroad.
None of these people have traveled abroad, nor have any of their family members, nor have they been in contact with anyone who is abroad.
There's no connection to the water polo championship in any of these, Ciupek said.
The head of the sanitary department, Pavla Svrčinová, said earlier that an international water polo tournament was being checked in Brno a few weeks ago.
It included players from South Africa and one Belgian player became ill after returning.
California is going to restrict the sale of guns.
He wants to do what Texas did to ban abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans Saturday to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous state in the United States, using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after detecting a heartbeat of an embryo.
The people would then be entitled to compensation in the event of a lawsuit against anyone in California who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms.
Newsom's announcement was in response to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Friday that upheld Texas' abortion ban, despite a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established the right to abortion in all U.S. states until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the Court has now decided not on the constitutionality of the whole Act, but on a technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban was made public in this case, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual judicial process.
"I am outraged by yesterday's decision by the United States Supreme Court, which allowed Texas to maintain its ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law", said the California governor.
"If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use that power to protect human lives", Newsom continues.
He reportedly instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the minister of justice on measures to empower public officials to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is the designation given to home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand at least $10,000 in damages and court costs from anyone in California who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, "ghost weapons" components or kits for their manufacture.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do", the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has for decades banned the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to reinstate the ban using the Texas model, the words of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, would be confirmed, as she warned in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority ruling against extending the legal mechanism to other U.S. states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant Texas' abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue to sue select Southern state officials.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where the vaccine scheme is gradually developed and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
There's a big study going on in Israel about the effects of four doses.
And these studies show that in most patients, there's a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it's going to have its own vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine is coming to market soon, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times more efficacy.
The quantity teaches you to keep it.

Poland threatens to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, it would be unlawful for the European Commission to use its new powers and stop the payment of money to Poland because of the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to draw on €36 billion from the EU's recovery fund for the economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this EU blackmail with a veto on all matters requiring unanimity", said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarny Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
'Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policies, which lead to drastic increases in energy prices,' added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland cease its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified given that the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical stance on EU accession than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes made to the Polish judiciary under Ziobrov's leadership threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
In the view of Mr Ziobra, Brussels is setting impossible conditions because its objective is not the rule of law but a change of government in Poland.
Warsaw is facing a "political dictatorship" that is being carried out by blackmail and attempts to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles, Ziobro also said.
He argued that Poland should be a member of an EU based on a partnership of sovereign states, not on the government of the strongest and the Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never make concessions to Brussels that would limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland's status as a colony", he declared.
But to be honest, we have this cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, one yogurt I'd met several times, all I needed was cheese, parmesan, and after ten minutes on the milk shelves, I gave up and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector there were all the select, less usual and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...

I've been watching the way the data is treated here for two years, and most anti-vaccination people are just a little bit more out of the box than most pro-vaccination people.
While there is rational discussion at the professional level, only extreme views are coming into the public space.
Constantly from wall to wall.
The binary thinking: vaccines will save us, vaccines are useless.
Banning everything, allowing everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analysis.
Comparing apples to pears.
This state has it this way, and we have it this way.

Wow, that's a relief.
Sorry for the interruption, and have a nice day, everyone.
I was punished with a cooking pot when I was a kid.
It was never about the grades, it was mostly just about my repeated refusal to obey and my being angry (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always threatening to punch me if I did it again (sometimes even after another "touch" she would just bring the stove and put it down so I could see it).
It was only after repeatedly refusing to listen that I received a few blows to the butt (over the clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable way) is beneficial because a child responds to it much more than words.
I think the important part is the warning part, because it gives the child a choice in a way whether to disobey and get it, or to get better and not get punished.
In the end, I usually just need a warning to start listening.
Defence of the system
When prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution means to him  whether it is a sacred document that is sworn to and that children learn about in school, or, conversely, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he decidedly adopted the first concept.
Once we agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our life, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with change it's better to save.
And imagine: some nations even like their own rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl was voting on the question.
However, lately, the opinion among lawyers is increasingly that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be amended.
The year is tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, and only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of government consisting of individual rules that set the political mantinels of the game.
We're afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we're banning politicians.
But at the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid is not choosing, in FN Brno they are fighting for the life of a few months baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults", Petr Dominik, the head of the Clinic of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Faculty Hospital of Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told Novinkom.
The process is much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are children who are very sick with coronavirus, which we have seen especially recently", added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children in need of moderate supportive care.
It's set at the pediatric infectious disease clinic.
Really, really seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently in the ARU.
The children with post-COVID syndrome were in the ward, according to the doctor, continuously throughout the year.
"There is now an increase in children with acute COVID pneumonia, that is, pneumonia requiring resuscitation bed", he said, adding that the disease affects adults as well as adolescents and babies as young as a few months old.
Children are also in critical condition in hospitals because of the coronavirus.
"We currently have a baby of several months and an adolescent", the mayor said.
However, she is happy that the FN Brno Children's Hospital has not recorded any child deaths from coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0-14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominika, in the children's hospital  not only in the coronavirus ward  is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
It also points out that, as in adults and children, vaccination slows the progression of the disease while reducing the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"We therefore recommend that children be given the vaccine", the doctor added.
You can only walk on marked roads in the peace zone.
But the quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on map.cz.
Generally, you can walk anywhere in national parks outside the peace zone (but don't climb over the fence into the park).
Skiing/biking in the forest off the marked path is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it's not so heavily guarded outside the national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
Music is in my head, Josef Kurfiřt laughs.
It's a freestyle opera, and it was originally played on the wood-horn.
As a singer he can sing practically all the repertoire and as a conductor he acts not only in the Liberec Theatre of F. Šalda, but perhaps also in Pilsen, in the Theater of Josef Kajetán Tyla.
He works with the City Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic and the Podkrkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression that the epidemic is under control and that the authoritarian regime is better at dealing with the crisis
Sinologist Jiroush: China is building the impression that the epidemic is under control and that the authoritarian regime is coping better with the crisis.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing rebuffed criticism for failing to stop a disease that had become a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero new cases.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping to combat the coronavirus in many ways, including in Italy, which has been hit hardest.
How do you see Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He meets a friend of a friend and he says, "Hey, you don't want an elephant?"
I got it, and it's great.
The wife is happy because she picks up the grass, she washes the car with the octopus, the children play with it.
It's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Friend: Let's shake hands, this is going to be great...
After a while they meet and the buyer complains: "Hey, what did you sell for an elephant?"
The lawn's crushed, the shit's all over the place, the car's broken, the kids are scared of him, and the wife wants a divorce.
The seller says: you talk badly about the elephant, you can't sell the elephant like that...
World affairs are controlled by the great powers.
Although the sovereign states are equal, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a great power if it works towards its integration.
It is still functioning at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
I personally think Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It's not gonna be 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and we'll get it done.
I've thought about it, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm just vocalizing.
I'm just assuming that an ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same plane.
I'll borrow an example from another commentary on Spanish oranges and mandarins, where it's clear that they're both from Spain, whereas Spanish fruit and mandarins are no longer clear that they're from Spain.
Plus, I base this on the fact that the sentence is "all American forces" including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated by Americans only.
So in other words, I expect it's already included in the broader concept and there's no need to specify it further in the US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just saying:
Either way, it's a ridiculous request

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey of astronaut Milly
The terrifying footage shows the moment when a frightened monkey curled up in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner washed it and laughed at it.
The Dutch monkey also fed sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrates Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who are caring for Milly after her abuse said they've never seen an alien so terrified.
Milly spent almost two years in rehab with the staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother of four pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent Magistrates Court, she was sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment, suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, banned from raising animals for life, and ordered to pay a fine of SEK 12,000 in legal costs.
The head of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue".
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She would shrink and hide from anyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement would make her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she's settled down and is content with the male, the sight of new people can still cause panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will follow her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent police discovered horrifying footage in her wife's phone after a drug-related raid on her apartment.
You can hear Milly in the footage, cursing.
In the next video, you can hear the Dutch monkey offering cocaine and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner, Russell Cox, 43, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
In her house, cocaine worth 1,600 pounds was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a 20-month suspended sentence.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistoric three times in a row if you boldly jump through the entire 20th century?
Like you're gonna wear the same stuff in first grade as you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing kills the idea of biffling, where nobody, with a few exceptions, cares whether you can do it or understand it.
You just write the test at one, and then nobody cares.
Go out and ask people on the street at random if you can figure out the characteristics of the roots of the quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everybody's been through it, and the absolute majority won't even check and tell you they're totally fucked.
Then what the fuck is he studying for?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the reality is that people don't want to and don't need to.
And at that point, it's useless, and you'll never get it in them anyway.
It's partly taught to the many people who will need this thing.
But like, that note that you don't really need all that stuff to stand by the machine, I mean it completely seriously because you just don't.
Plus, we're getting to the point where not knowing is a punch.
(Which probably has to do with our communist past and the harassment of the educated and the elites) But the price of these machines being barbaric is simply high.
If journalists could count, the COVID would never have reached this level.
The war between Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away", Andrea answered on Instagram Stories to the usual questions of curious fans, which so disappointed her on Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
Kadri and Andrea have been at odds since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea was moving to live with her, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
She firmly refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only didn't end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! He was upset by Kadri's turn in reaction to Andre's accusations of lying, gambling and debt.
Kadri's supposed honesty was now not to the liking of his ex-wife, nor of his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
I don't normally talk about these things at all, and we never really said that much in our family.
I certainly don't want to cause any pity.
But when I see someone trying to hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much in public, I just don't give it to them!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most despite his young age.
I'm even more sorry to have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I wish so much that everyone knew Kadri as I, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to Andrey's words.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the facts and know what it really was like, she added.
A drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You wouldn't believe what I'm doing here.
Chao started his robbery in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the information available, he eventually stole less than CZK 330 from one vehicle.
After that, he couldn't think of anything better than to climb up to the fifth floor and walk into the apartment through the open window.
He stole two bananas there.
A security camera then caught him walking down the street away from the crime scene, eating a banana.
When the owner woke up in the morning, he found the bananas were not where they were, and he called the police.
She subsequently detained Cha.
The man confessed to drinking some alcohol on the day of the crime.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob drunk.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
A drunk climbed the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is limited in time and is effective only in the case of pandemic emergencies.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law limits the scope of business
That's not enough of a reason?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
Saturday's election in four municipalities saw over 60 percent of voters turn out.
The new parliamentary assemblies were elected on Saturday in the villages of Komňa in Uherskohradištka, Lužice in Mostecka, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelhřimovsk.
The number of deputies in these municipalities has decreased under the number established by law or the elected representatives have been dissolved.
A total of 28 seats were contested on Saturday with 99 candidates.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest is 33.
The election results on Saturday symbolically bring us to the end of a rather difficult but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place, said the Deputy President of the Czech Socialist Republic, Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In the Uherskohradištská municipality, the Association of Independent Candidates won the election on Saturday, receiving 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member parliament.
The candidate of STAN received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means a win of two mandates.
Citizens for the Commune also won two seats in the parliament, with 18.52 percent of the vote.
The former mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privateers, was also re-elected.
One seat in the Chamber of Deputies was won by Comenius  independent candidates.
75.48 percent of eligible voters turned out.
In the village of Rovná on Pelhřimovska, the association Pro Rovná won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 have been elected to the City Council.
Voter turnout was 93.62%.
The repeated elections in Lužica na Mostecku were again won by the Lužica and Svinčice Association led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member parliament.
The second place was taken by the candidate of the Municipality for the People, who got 43.27 percent of the votes, so she will have three representatives in the Chamber of Deputies.
76.7 percent of the voters turned out.
The election in Nova Ves on Liberec was won by the independent candidates of Hope for a New Ves from the ANO Movement.
The Independent Candidates Association received 59.88% of the vote, winning four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO won 40.12 percent of the vote and against the 2018 elections, it gained three more seats.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the results of the election will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Law Collection.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write about.
You're just playing dumb so you can have someone to "argue" with.
If not, then it's sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerate or anything.
I even like a lot of church buildings aesthetically (which was the goal, after all, to make them look good).
And I don't care who believes what.
On the other hand, I'm bothered by how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it took, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, like the Thirty Years' War.
You may believe in the spaghetti monster, but state and church have nothing to do together.
The man fell headlong from twelve meters.
He survived the impact.
A man in Ostrava survived the incredible fall on Sunday night, when he was intercepted by the regional medical emergency service.
The regional operations center responded to a distress call one hour after midnight Saturday with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two ZZS medical and medical crews were immediately dispatched to the scene.
When paramedics arrived, they found that a 27-year-old man had fallen from a window some 40 feet [12 m] above the ground and hit the concrete with his head!
Coal caught in the Wickes.
But not as it should be, and the fire department went in.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of death.
The doctor who intervened in the incident intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation and after further measures in the pre-hospital emergency care, an ambulance transported him to the Ostrava trauma center, said Lukáš Humpl, spokesman for the Ministry of Health of the MS region.
I'm more concerned than coronavirus about the inadequate response of the public and the authorities.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of defense against the disease is primarily doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking the military doctor, David the Butcher.

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a great gala night, full of interesting results.
Because there were things going on at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peña managed to beat legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not found a winner in seven years.
Charles Oliveira in the lightweight division, he did not hesitate, he made a great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt with a technical knockout in the first round.
He also beat his opponent Sean O'Malley.
A surprise no one expected.
This was brought about by the women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the battle as a fictional dwarf, Nunes having not lost for seven years, and grinding her teeth for another triumph.
And the beginning of the duel was a paper-based premise.
Nunes started the race very actively, even giving her opponent a push kick that sent her to the ground.
However, Peña did not allow herself to be forced into any further error and unsuccessfully attempted to attack with a lever on her hand.
Round two was a thrilling and exciting one for MMA fans.
Both competitors boasted a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
And the foam one got Nunes on the ground, where she started strangling her.
She had to give up and try to break the attack.
So the American shocked everyone by becoming the new champion.
The climax of the gala was the fight between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier was doing better, but gradually the cards began to turn.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to pinch the opponent with a lever on his arm.
He did not do well, but then he put a lot of pressure on himself, hit the opponent in the back and inflicted a series of wounds.
That's how he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to unlock the strangulation.
The Brazilian defended the title, Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley claimed the victory, having already used a hard right-back on Raul Paiv in the first round.
He then beat him with a series of precision strokes, recording his 15th triumph.
Kara-France was able to get a hold of Cody Garbrand.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little girl, now seven years later, she lost.
That hip or that hip?
It's not complicated at first glance.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or middle gender.
But then there's also a fairly large group of nouns for which the genus is not fixed.
Such nouns vary between two families.
When bent, they acquire double ends and in some cases remain in an unbending shape.
For example, the words svízel or kyčel are both masculine and feminine, in the former they are bent according to the pattern mastr, in the latter according to the pattern píseň.
For another group of nouns, different forms are already present in the first case of a single number, for example: orderek/order, kedluben/kedlubna or brambor/potato (in the sense of food).
Both forms are spelling, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example okurka in Czech and okurek in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unspelled, similarly other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: příkop and příkopa, kobliha and koblih etc.
Some words that have entered Czech from other languages were initially unwilling, but gradually they are taking over the Czech endings.
Typical examples are image, which is both masculine and feminine, or bufet, which has remained unfavorable in the middle gender, but has grad-like endings in the masculine.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What's the situation right on the Greek border?
Tensions are high at the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to flee to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians are promising Greece support, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What, in fact, motivates refugees to take the uncertain route?
And what's the situation on the ground?
We hadn't seen the blue sky for three months and were suffocating, describes a Sydney journalist
The devastating fires, which have been raging in Australia for four months, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of acres of land.
How are the authorities and the people coping?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic consequences that critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in terms of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is speaking to Sydney journalist Ikea Detrich.
False accusations have always been, and are, quite rare.
That's why everyone is always in the news.
It's uncomfortable for people to talk about what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to order it.
I don't know anyone personally who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've seen how these people are often treated by their neighbors or even the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
It's become a trend for victims to finally open up about their trauma.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who will falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a lot of the accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend", you're only helping the sexual abusers.
Czech Republic flooded with unfinished houses, families have no money to finish
The price of building materials has risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got in a bind because of it.
She has no money to complete the family homes and the banks refuse to extend her mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works is also rising.
People therefore do not have enough money to complete the family homes that have already been built.
In many cases, banks refuse to extend mortgage loans to them, creating an extremely uncomfortable situation.
At best, people move into more spacious, unfurnished homes.
In the worst case, the houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and rent", says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two or three family homes in a year, and we're 50 percent done.
The hard part for us as a construction company is that we have to keep certain things contractually, even when the materials have gone up.
So we work without earnings", said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are going to be in financial trouble.
If they figured it would cost five million to build the house, now it's gonna cost seven.
I think some will wait", added Slivoň.
The most expensive materials were copper, iron, and plumbing and heating equipment.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
The Czech Republic lacks graduates in construction and the influx of foreign workers is being slowed by the pandemic.
The only situation that is more favourable at the moment is the situation with regard to the issuing of a building permit.
"The building authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago", Křeček said.
We're doing well, and we're going to do better.
But the real vision is missing, says the CRO commentator  myRozhlas
In addition to the traditional celebrations, the new year is traditionally marked by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and the President of ANO Andrei Babis and the Christmas message of President Milos Zeman, the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What vital lesson have we learned?
I've got my own topic I've chosen, I'm working on my bachelor's, I always work on it for a year, and then in a week or two I write a piece.
The State's not too concerned with this. If you're not a total monkey and there's something left in your head, the commission won't suffocate you on theory.
I was studying for a week, and when I was at the end of my term, the committee would always try to get me to some logical deduction that would come to me right away and I would get it right.
Otherwise, for these projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we've done it many times, really profitable, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're great.
I think it's great when there's an exam at the end of the course, where you showcase the knowledge you've gained from the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't take e-mails and phone calls and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same dick they are.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they'd be taking a lot of risks, so maybe they'd have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a statue of Putin next to the Pooh Bear.
You might want to put it in a way that he can touch Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing sticks at artists.
Once you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach is reduced to an absolute minimum.
Plus, it's always changing which function is more important, whether it's a like, a comment or a save.
I've been getting really worked up lately, so I might have to reduce myself to a tiktok where a lot of artists in my industry are successful and they're not going to let it happen.
I might even like to see something that's more user-friendly that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Statement by the Workers' Party of Donbas
The union  yes, break up  no, expresses its opinion on the picture of the opponents of the break-up of the USSR.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind occurred.
In Beloveg Prales on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shuskevich, without any legal powers and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the openly condescending attitude of Mikhail Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist.
With one stroke of the pen, they shook a vast country of nearly 300 million people.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russians were forced to live abroad.
Since the early 1990's, Russia's population has declined by 10 to 11 million.
Even with the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years in one sitting in the Bělověj forest betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately de-industrialized, curbed agriculture, cut off from the world's greatest power 14 republics that had previously been economically linked in a single mechanism.
If we look deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the military, the increase in crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO's expansion to the east, the war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all the results of geopolitical capitulation, the abandonment of the socialist camp first, and then the Soviet Union.
There's a concept in political science called the vacuum of power.
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken, mainly because of the events of the late 1980's and early 1990's.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a high turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs £19.
I'll buy it with the idea of putting it in the fridge and making it Thursday dinner.
In an alternative reality where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain sells it at $50 a pound on Tuesday, can you describe the mechanism by which the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system as its price changes?
Or if I wait until Thursday and the meat is discounted to $69 a kilo the day before the date of consumption - how would this meat differ from the meat I bought on Monday for $120, and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer for myself - nothing.
This bullshit about if something is cheap, it's bound to be bad, rotten or low quality is really retarded, to tell you the truth.
I went to Brno recently and in the hallway the ladies were giving out some brochure, I always take such things to help the brigadiers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of country-minded and conservative views on how the world works, but there was nothing about God, so I was confused, but I knew it was going to be some kind of riot.
After I finished reading, I found out who published it, and eventually Scientology came out.
Well, it was like good stuff, full of totally useless instructions, like how to wash and not be a dick.
It's a waste of paper, it wouldn't have cut the forests.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to accommodate the person because you love them without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself a few times because I was going out with a friend who she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I tried to leave her apartment early, she would cry and beg me on my knees not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
For a year, it was a great relationship, but then another six months went by and she started getting fucked.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her I was breaking up and telling her I could talk about it next week to calm her down and keep her from having another stroke.
A person like that sucks your feelings, your emotions and your overall joy out of you.
Better keep your distance
When they're raiding insurance companies with a racket of tests and chasing positive ones, who wouldn't even know about this horrible disease if they didn't get tested.
All we're getting is complications for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the random number generator have been put under house arrest for five days.
In the West, they've stopped the clownishness and realized that it's no use dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Warlock is new and he's got to steal more and fuel his ego by making up pussy.
I see the good old bastard is coming back.
After years of suppression and suppression of this rogue business, MLM recruiting is back on the upswing.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it out (I was 20 years old, freshman in high school), and the initial promises of product training and business skills quickly turned into "don't care about that, get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and talk.
When the first money came in, the man quickly realized that if he wanted to make money, he had to raise a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profits, so you felt like a pot seller.
What can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned not to jump at every glance and check the information thoroughly.
I wouldn't throw them all in the same bag.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly will not boast of expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I haven't seen much of that in the corporate world I work for.
HR is calm, managers are mindful of their management, and they don't get too involved.
So, the regular evaluation is kind of happening, the way it's happening here, it's pretty much going on (set some goals for the next year, next year we'll see what works and what doesn't) - it's more like self-evaluation, rather than someone evaluating you by some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we're also a little bit unique within our company -- there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you get the feeling we're like a near-startup that squats in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so we don't get too worked up as long as the results are there.
The Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police searched in vain for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing in late November.
On Sunday, December 12, the resigning foreign minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Uhersk was found dead.
British police have unfortunately confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that they have found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
Cause of death is under investigation.
With respect to the family, we're not releasing any more information on the case.
My heartfelt condolences, said Kulhanek on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on a bus on her way home from work, supposed to have picked up money from an ATM before boarding.
Her colleagues at work reported her missing five days later.
She was subsequently sought by the London police, and she was listed by Interpol as missing in action worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech missing persons database.
Police arrested a man in connection with the incident several days ago.
What part he was playing in the case and what he's suspected of but hasn't disclosed.
In four municipalities, new councils were allocated by the end of the year.
On Saturday 11 December, new parliamentary seats were elected in the villages of Komňa in Uherskohradištka, Lužice in Mostecka, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelhřimovska.
The number of deputies in these municipalities has decreased under the number established by law or the elected representatives have been dissolved.
The 28 seats were contested by 99 valid candidates in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
The mandate was won by a total of 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest is 33.
A total of 13 candidates were registered for the new elections to the local councils in the four municipalities mentioned.
There were 36 women and 63 men running for 28 seats.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72.
The election results on Saturday symbolically bring us to the end of a rather difficult but successful year.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place.
We had to work in more challenging epidemic conditions, which made more demands on equipment and personnel, said Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling was done on Sunday, December 12th at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, once approved, will be published in the National Law Collection.
This is the biggest problem I've had with the pandemic.
It took me a while to get over the fact that we had a pretty dangerous infectious disease at the very beginning, but it went without any major setbacks.
Comparing how stupidly a large part of the population at all levels of society is going about it, that's what I'm having trouble with right now.
I'm most looking forward to the vaccine tomorrow because it's going to make me less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be stripped of his presidency and his ability to reclaim it.
The chances of that actually happening are, as others here are saying, very slim.
Besides, I'm not sure that a charted file could ever be considered high treason.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex all year is increasing
More and more young adults in the United States are living their lives without sex.
These are mostly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the percentage of people under 35 who give up their sex lives has increased from eight to 21 percent.
The number of women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they had not had sex in the past year is higher than ever.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks, and video games that make sex less and less a priority for young people may also have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly", said Lyman Stone, a researcher at IFS.
Married people are more likely to engage in sexual activity, with only 5% of those in 2021 reporting that they have not had sex in the past year.
For single people, it was 29 percent. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital sex and religious affiliation also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of those married before 35 is still falling.
Young people are divided on premarital sex, with about 30 percent saying it is wrong, while about 70 percent think it is okay.
"It's true that among single individuals in this age group they are a minority, but their behavior is pushing the trend", Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate among single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 to nearly 60%.
Among "less religious" people, the trend has risen from 10 to 20 percent", Stone said.
Other factors have also contributed to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and, most notably, social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people who are unemployed or on lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seem to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, thus "replacing" this need.
This trend was mainly captured during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole mandate of COVID vaccination is about whether society should force a segment of the population to behave in ways that they don't want to, but that can save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question, and one that I'm most interested in, personally, is the question of social conscience.
I mean, like, if we don't order them to do it and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, who we didn't explain it to him well, who heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get the vaccine, and he eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a staunch anti-vaccination activist who is here alongside the SPD and the KSČ, screaming about bullying and the totalitarian state.
From the statistics I've mentioned, it's pretty clear that most of the unvaccinated retirees are probably in the latter group, so they're really going to be responsible for it.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does mild winter help to fight drought?
This winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic so far.
Ski operators cannot do without technical snow, as the weather complicates the preparation of the Jizerské padeská.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will a lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about the pancake maker.
One time in high school, my teacher took us all around town on a boat ramp so we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there we once walked along a rather wide street and who we don't seem to see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they came after us.
I escaped, but a friend of mine got into a fight.
After she left, the teacher and I asked her what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul", she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the dockyard.
We're so spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations", Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
He also called on the EU to take the necessary steps to ensure that the EU's citizens are protected from the threat of terrorism.
The crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Normandy Group" of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because every night we record a hundred attempts to cross the (illegal) border.
He's been talking to the chancellor about further sanctions so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by the Lukashenko regime, according to DPA.
A drunken Polish nun blamed the accident, tried to cover it up
The car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was already being driven by another nun, who tried to take the blame.
When police told her that she could still lose her license for failing to drive and being caught off-scene, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that she was hit by another nun who asked her for help.
Then the police came for Celestina's sister.
She underwent a breath test, and after finding that her blood count was over two milliliters, her license was immediately revoked.
At the same time, she was told that she would be brought to justice for her actions.
Hugo's dog is doing what he can.
But Juraj Shaimovich didn't see his movie.
Czech creators of family comedies have seen each other in American stories about dog pets.
But they forgot the essential thing: the legality of the film business.
After the F. Brabz Gump movie, The Dog Who Taught People How to Live, there's a new movie coming out that's about the emotions of the audience.
Co-writer and director Juraj Šajmovič Jr. is loosely based on his previous film Here I Watch from 2012.
Speaking cartoon Hugo returns to the stage with some familiar faces around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Schumacher pension, who is dying, so they start inviting the dog-keepers, Julia's father and partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She's no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) had struggled with the narrative techniques in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of awe and embarrassment.
Let's just get this straight.
Julie, though a scientist, succumbs to the illusions of darkness in her desire for a child and, if the correct constellation comes along, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are just determining  on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired Colonel Mojmír despite years of training shoots his own daughter (Juliia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which the family takes her to the hospital to play a mysterious process of healing by poison in the heart of the forest solitude.
Nothing against the purifying treatment of nature and the power of pets.
The owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at the amount of content, filled with incredible situations and figures, that was needed for this message.
A couple of staff thieves, a dog-dogging contest, a shuma shenanigans, cops coming in on a drug-seeking stunt and discussing herbs about the fertile power of bone meal, which a baked-up family in a boarding house will, of course, drink.
When the heroine wakes up from a severe coma and then sits undulating and smoking a cigar at the family table, demanding her father's whiskey and flacon as a cured vegetarian, it's hard not to laugh.
The screenplay explains to the viewer that sometimes this happens after a coma.
The team of Shaimovic lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of text work, ability to depict bear situations, sense for characters and point and directing.
The performances are uneven, the cut is blurry, and the overall impression is flat.
No matter how Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their party back, they don't have much to play for.
The only remaining film is the poetic shots of the Shumav nature of cameraman Vladimir Holomek and a pair of javelins.
It's not enough to sketch out a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog-calling, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions the characters engage in.
It's not even a matter of years of membership in the Scissor Club, as in the case of the producer.
The good intentions behind promoting nature and the friendship between man and dog must be accompanied by a knowledge of the craft if one is to tell a believable story.
That didn't work out in this case.
For a good family picture, there's a little too much eroticism and a minimum of genre-sensitivity.
Even as a canister therapy commercial, this amateurish piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from idiots like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, and it shows how much shit you understand, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn't want it, the answer is always no.
If you'd listened to that kind of kid all the time, you might've changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a benefit brigade.
The Middle East has been plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of year when it rains.
"The near-total absence of rainfall during November, as we have seen on some stations, is unusual", the Israeli Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of its long-term average rainfall in November.
The two-day rainfall this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a while.
It's also the perfect Christmas setting, enjoyed by the people of Nazareth, Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel occurs almost exclusively during the winter months, and it is sudden and irregular.
The forests depend on the winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fire.
It's not just forests, it's also drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, has been filled to the brim this spring by the last three rainy winters.
The levels have been dropping ever since.
Water managers have been warning of drought for a long time.
"Depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall may be expected to decline", Uri Schor, spokesperson for the Israel Water Authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies like desalination or wastewater recycling.
The situation is worse in the economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
Tankers are increasing in the streets of Amman, the capital of Jordan.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years", said Imad Suleyman, a tanker driver, in September.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The local riverbed was completely dry.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran
The Israeli Defense Minister said that the Vienna talks had produced no progress and that he had informed Washington about the preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said Saturday he has ordered the Israeli military to prepare for a possible military strike on Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is in the US, has been trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also been briefing Washington on military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had made "no progress" and that the world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing tricks on them".
I had this happen to me about three years ago.
The lady liked me a little bit and barbecued during the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
I finally found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Since I really don't like these scams, I kept the lady in suspense and questioning for a while, and finally thanked her and left.
You can tell me I'm a jerk, but a pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisors are financial advisors.
The skiers went to the mountains for the weekend, and there was plenty of snow and good weather.
A Czech ski resort has seen its first major skiing rush this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, snow is not a necessity and some ski areas have started operating.
The rider also did not rule out the requirement to prove himself on the trains with a COVID certificate.
While the skiers are not complaining about the lack of interest from customers, some ski equipment rental companies are reporting lower demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people took to the trails and the slopes in the Liberec region over the weekend.
The skiers were looking forward to the sunny weather and the excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out of that Friday night skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill", said the director of the Sports Complex Ještěd Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people have also set out for the first weekend skiing in the new season in the Autumn.
The Karlov Ski Arena or the center in Brno on Šumperska were open.
The weekend was very decent, with an estimated 400 people attending on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Brna Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators may only sell skipas to people who are vaccinated or who are in the period after COVID-19 has been confirmed.
Except for exceptions, people are ready and have the necessary documents, said René Hroneš from the ski center Spindlerův Mlýn.
"We've only recorded incident units", he added.
Interest rates are lower than they were before the pandemic, according to some ski rental companies and ski equipment stores.
Interest in ski rentals is fortunately there.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
He's expecting a bigger effort during ski season.
Also, David Shinták, the head of the Royal Snowbear Society, feels that due to COVID, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost bankrupt.
Compared to the pre-pandemic period, we are at about 50 percent, said CTC Shintak.
He said that people became lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, there is a high demand for rental in the Novako on the God's Gift area.
They started ski rentals a week ago, and now people have to order them in advance.
"We're starting to rent the races this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year", said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the facility.
She said the same interest as before the epidemic is also shown in the ski school.
If we want the rich and successful to not go abroad, they have to be able to live a quality life like they did abroad.
This is certainly not the case in socialist health care, where it is often impossible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and clever people go abroad who have no property here.
The owner of a company going abroad is not just going away.
I totally agree with the rest.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic and if these people don't have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they just won't live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary started with Orbán winning one day, a year in office, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot suddenly find itself in a similar position.
The next question is the election.
If you live like a fool, you might as well win this one with some traditional V4 freak.
The young and educated will leave, and the supporters will be left, and the people whose wealth cannot be put on a plane.
What a scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film Ostrov, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55), enjoyed tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury or is it a makeup for the shoot?
London police are still looking for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behavior and we're starting to be very concerned about her", Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very worried about her and just want to know where she is", she continued.
Missing Czech reportedly left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28th, heading home to Camberwell.
She was last reportedly seen on the bus about a half hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3rd by one of her co-workers.
According to the UK media, Srnc worked as a nurse's aide at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Group.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Peter, who is missing", a group of health facilities said in a tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help her find to contact the police", the statement continued.
The public is also being urged to cooperate by MP Harriet Harman, who brought the case to the public at a press conference on Saturday.
"She's been missing for days, she's only 32, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death", the Labour politician said, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by London police.
"I feel like we all have a particularly big responsibility to try and find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family and working here for our health care", Harman said.
Police have previously arrested a man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC news website, police have not provided any information on his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine that much either.
That's not a "huge amount", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps saying that we're exaggerating the threat of invasion and it's getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted it above.
I don't know what makes you think Russia wants war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparison to the situation in '38 is off in so many ways that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare that to the first Punic war and the "annexation" of Sicily:D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not going to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia is annexing these ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the borders would be.
That is, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, mainly for suburban services
The PID passengers in Prague are expecting a number of changes from Sunday, particularly for suburban services.
New lines were created, some changed routes, and others disappeared.
Mladoboslavsk is newly joining the integrated system.
In the capital, the buses from Český Budějovice stop at the Garden City station from Sunday.
In the suburban railway transport, the S7 trains depart from Beroun to Český Brod via Prague Central Station.
The newly opened Prague-Zahradny Město station will be served by the R17 expressway from Český Budějovice and Benešov.
The PID will be expanded to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna near Jesenice, Old Splavs and Turnov.
Buses to Mladoboleslavsk will be included, including lines to the Liberec and Královéhradec regions.
The integration will see 77 lines scrapped, 37 new lines introduced and 12 existing lines re-commissioned.
From Prague's Zličín, a new bus line 405 will start and go all the way to Žatka.
A new direct connection to Prague  Kralovice near Rakovník has also been established, replacing the cancelled S53 train line.
They will be reinforced at the morning peak and on the weekend, the link from Prague to Rakovník will be updated with the new express line 404.
The PID system includes the new lines 400 and 410 to the Liberec region.
They leave from Střížkov metro station, not from Holešovice railway station.
The backbone line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Novi Bory and selected connections continue to Rumburka or Cvikova.
The 410 route runs through Malník and Dubou to Doks, Mimona and Jablonny in Podještědi.
On the contrary, new traffic on dozens of Central Bohemian local routes, including those to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál under Třemšín, has been cancelled or restricted.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the Prague  Beroun, Prague  Lysá nad Labem and Cologne lines.
Changes are waiting for passengers at other locations as well.
Buses are replacing some of the cancelled railway lines or extending the section on line 420 from Dobříš with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsk.
The route of lines 540 to 543 in Nymbursk has been modified and the route of some buses on the border between Central Bohemia and Hořovicka in the Pilsen region has been modified.
Healthy breakfast/lunch at the office from the supermarket
Hey, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a half-hour break, and my only option for getting food is to go to next door to Billy's or a little further down to Lidl's.
Since I don't have any exercise, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and I'll buy a pizza crust and a yogurt and an apple for breakfast.
Question: What healthy, heat-free food would you recommend I buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a meter of snow like you, which is unfortunately the case.
And it's not the trees you have to see.
Only the top of a tree can be hidden under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're not allowed to drive off the runway, but it's one of them.
I wasn't looking forward to this at all.
The Czech showbiz pool has been living on nothing since Friday, except for the revelation of the relationship between Dary Rollins and Pavel Nedved.
They've been together for years, a famous football player even got divorced for a singer.
Dara has now sent a long message to her fans explaining why she's been keeping her love from them for six months.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would not know that Dara caught a bear, so sorry, Nedvěda", jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech football player.
He said he picked her up, not the other way around.
Three days of attention, and although they're used to public interest, they don't enjoy it.
And here it is.
What we both didn't look forward to, but knew would happen one day, goes on.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's the ones who don't care and it pops out of the can on them, or us whose lives are being ripped apart.
As if anyone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your spouse or your girlfriend were good enough for each other, or you insisted that everyone really know the details of your ex-partners and be familiar with your list of mistakes and mistakes.
That's what you want, you little shit.
The pair met in Italy, where Rolins was traveling to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedved is a long-time vice president of Juventus football club.
They didn't come out with the truth until now, because they were waiting for Ned's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife, Ivan, have been separated for three years, not married on paper but only three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, we thank you.
We're just people, too, we have families, we have children, we have a past, we have dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
"That's why I love my new husband, and just as he stands by me, I stand by him, for better or worse", Rolins concluded.
Hey, the other commenters have said about everything that's important, just confirming that the tracks are great in the beginning, my classmates usually meet and befriend each other during the first semester or two and then find sub-tenants together, which seems like the best option to me, because you know who you're gonna be living with.
Apartments don't usually advertise too far in advance, so you probably won't find much right now, but it sure doesn't hurt to look at the listing.
Otherwise, avoid not only Ceylon, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovska, Francovska, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenic are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Beverly district is very student-friendly, the King's Field, and in that direction it's fine, besides it's close to most of the VUT faculties (I don't know where you're going exactly).
I've never looked for a rental, but I'm a native of Brno, so I can possibly advise Brno as such, if you're still missing any information:)
That's an example of perfectly "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland decided to do, it's actually perfectly fine that the state doesn't fund some schools enough.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it on their own, or they go by the state and pay for it.
We can't let a private actor take over a piece of education just because they're going to pay a few crowns to the full state subsidy and then they're going to be able to teach whatever they want in schools.
Such a statement loses some of its weight when written by a person who two days earlier had said about the petition for boycotting the totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same to you as a vote against a statue standing in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who put you on the job.
Otherwise, I've seen in cataloging/digitizing that (and that's even long-term professionals) they either throw it away somehow, or they write something like xxx*** or ... (depending on the convention) and in the note that it's unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it's pretty legible, so I probably wouldn't recommend it at all.
Personally, I'd probably sort of deal with that in a note depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a good, hard-working student, you can look up some character databases and find the one that's closest to you.
But since it looks like you're drawing from some book, I'd guess that the author or the printer simply created their own character that matches what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it more the Odrysian Kingdom than the Odryn?
PSS: Someone's already cracked it for you.
Check out the commentary with the ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That's a lot worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is ridiculous.
All the important documents that are approved are examined word for word, and even a basic knowledge of English is not enough, it's the business of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in the various EU institutions, and English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, for establishing relationships that are above the norm.
Plus, with the English, it's pretty interesting, after the UK's exit from the EU.
I don't understand the hat on Ceil.
I've been working there for three years and I'm doing fine.
How many times I drive home from work at 10pm and never have a problem.
That it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who's hardly ever been there.
Yeah, there's probably most of Brno's Roma population, but all they do is they get in the way of the sidewalk and I park where they don't have:D definitely not that I'd be afraid to go out on the street there at night.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the city centre, I'd go for it.
Plenty of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slovák (78) without Dada and Gelemova's mistress like a stake in a fence!
Who's he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle at the Advent wreath, but Felix Slovak did not.
I don't have an advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
"I've seen the date wreath, and I'm sure Lucia has one too", said the saxophonist to Blitz, confirming Patras' words by visiting her often.
She visits, but does not live, their house in Vinohrade, where Dada has been left alone since his departure.
The Slovak still doesn't know where he's going on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
Felix Slovak and Lucie Gelem: Together again!
Felix Slovak and Lucie Gelem: Together again!
But we kept talking, so we didn't have Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy presents all the time, and I'm sure I'll buy Daddy and Lucia something, like perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who came to the christening of a music video at the Richman Club himself.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to play with, says the Slovak, who was happy to meet the wife of Lužek Soboty, Adriana, or the singer Kamil Nyvltová.
And he made it clear.
And we're Icelanders so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us, and our location is so strategic, the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, so explain it to me.
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Police are scarce and cannot afford it, so are firefighters, and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of people with medical training at that level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava is a problem for the previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the country should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is experiencing the worst drought in years.
Water has been reduced in mountainous and low-lying areas, and there has been a smaller amount of precipitation in areas where there was no previous water shortage.
Climate change is the cause of the drought that is affecting much of central Europe.
But the impact is also amplified by the way we manage our land.
What can be done to prepare for the drought?
And how can we help nature in its time of trouble?
Yeah, I'm gonna be, I can barely keep up with ice skating, I know what hockey is, and that tactic (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a complete delusion.
And whether you're a Russian Bear or a Chinese Lama hockey team, losing by two goals even though you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than being tied.
But anyway, as I listen to the Czech commentators who are pointing out what the referees don't care about whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's the way it is with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And if it were the other way around, it's like always, and that Czech Republic and Russia have lost more often than they've won, I think it would be classic "they lost" versus "WE won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
There are 5,766 people hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, 74 more.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are 1967 to 100,000, 871 to 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
29,929 new infections have been reported in the last 24 hours.
It's the lowest daily count since October 13th.
The total number of registered cases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an "unavoidable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the British Health Security Agency, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with the micron are already being hospitalized in the UK, and Hopkins expects the numbers to rise.
No deaths have been reported so far from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about two weeks after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson may have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
A minister in the Johnson administration argued that the quiz was conducted virtually, via a computer.
But it was attended by a group of employees gathered around the computers in Downing Street.
There is growing pressure in Britain to remove Johnson from the prime minister's post.
During the December lockdown in London, which banned Christmas parties, Johnson's ministers held numerous events despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have made fun of them:
Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won the general election by a landslide.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events unfolded.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is facing an election this spring that could end the 12-year rule of Viktor Orbán.
It will be an election of European importance.
How much can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They're not likely to be free either, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituencies to profit from it, and does other tricks, bigger and smaller.
The last one so far is that everyone can vote wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from the contested districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they're not gonna be fair at all.
Do you think it's going to be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
It's a very different situation.
It used to be about, not whether Fidesz won, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that the united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is a big surprise for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play harder in an effort to keep power?
Yes, we have some indication that they're ready to go beyond what they've been doing so far.
A recording of the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövere, explaining to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security, was recently leaked to the independent media.
Are these the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, that's one of the new ones.
It all starts with the tongue.
I've been beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom's parents aren't very patient, neither am I, my dad has a long time, but then he goes off in extremes (only in relation to me).
I was also very cholera and I got very angry as a child, to the point where I was lying on the ground in a cramp and I was all blue, and I had to take it out of the shower twice to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me in the face at school, sometimes it was more like they didn't know.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with things violently now, too, because I was a bit of a fighter when I was little, and now I'm just going to punch myself in the face for a little bit of a kick, and as a younger person, I would slap my parents' hands, for example, so I wouldn't get too much in the mouth, so I never do anything extreme, but I always have this urge.
I can't say how explosive it is, but I'm sure the upbringing has a part to play.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that beating kids is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at a time when it was no longer educational, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just fucks up, it's probably not possible not to give their kids a little bit of a break, so I won't blame them.
I'm not offended, I don't see why the O.R. should be ashamed of anything.
The laws are supposed to be clear and unambiguous.
I would call those who make laws of that quality, Kundams.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're afraid of a power outage?
Can you really expect people to want the product and buy it and you'll have the mortgage to pay for it?
The monster world of the Kochner.
Where does Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main story begins in the trial of the four accused of the murder of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It disrupted civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How crucial will the process be for Slovakia?
The press is a big part of this.
How is it possible that this petition got a whole lot more media attention than the anti-petition of the deans of all the medical schools that came out a day or two later?
No, they got screwed, and the company bounced back.

The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage is nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karl Havlíček needs to be fundamentally revised
Prime Minister Andrei Babis's government is over, and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens were respected in the selection and authorization of the deep-sea storage of highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the government suspended the discussion of the proposal, which was submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of debate.
The content of the agreement is, however, in serious contradiction not only with the municipalities concerned associated in the Platform against Deep Landfill, but also with the Association of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local authorities expect the law to strengthen their options in deciding on the storage site, as promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and as required by the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The proposal for a law by Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is criticized by municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a site for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if the municipality or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in the given location.
This can be ensured by requiring the administration of the repository to obtain the consent of the municipalities concerned before the start of a specific procedure.
The draft operational plan submitted by the Commission almost completely ignores the public involvement and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in the permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a systematic setting of compensation for municipalities for the whole process of finding and selecting a site for a storage site, its authorisation and operation.
Municipal officials are not really in a position to defend the interests of their citizens in their search for a storage site under current legal norms.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they submit observations or appeal, but the decision shall be taken by the authority or minister in whose interest the authorisation is to be issued.
Any action shall not have a delaying effect on the execution of exploration or construction works.
The co-decision of local authorities that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those that have already made progress in authorising storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
The drafting of the law is, moreover, another failure of the state administration, which hires outside legal offices to draft legislation.
In this case, the contract is with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from the contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount of these works is estimated to be nearly CZK 4 million, according to the contract register.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of Cejle from the town of Hrádek and spokesman for the Platform against Deep Waste said: "After the ministers of industry, who only passed on to their successors the adjustment of the position of the local government in relation to the state authorities in the search for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We're offering a helping hand.
We also thank the Association of Cities and Towns for their support, which sees the issue of the lack of rights of the towns in such a crucial construction project in the same way as the towns directly affected in selected locations.
The Anti-Deep Landing Platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste that is not limited to deep landing sites.
The platform also advocates that the decision to select a site for possible storage should be made subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman, 69, was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 200 pounds.
Although he had not needed to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And it worked.
Goodman has gradually lost 200 pounds, half of his original weight of 300 pounds, reports The Sun.
He bragged about his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a whole different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body caused the furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth", the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
I wanted to do it slowly this time.
Move, work out.
I'm getting to the age where I can't afford to sit still, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss you're using the word "boss" for.
If it's some kind of text on the platform that's waiting for the game environment to read, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text, maybe a college text, I'd probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more than one kind of boss.
Like a game like Dark Souls, etc. has multiple bosses, right, so "boss" is kind of like the lord/ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who are not needed to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there's Half-Life, where the bosses are there, but the player doesn't actually meet them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they're called that?
Well, then there's the mini-bosses.
It is impossible to translate the boss in a one-word way, Czech and other languages do not solve it (the only interesting thing is Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
It's basically a story or game in general, a computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all the previous ones, and watching over the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is looking for Peter of London.
The Czech police are involved.
The British police have been searching for the missing Peter Srnc since December 3rd.
The Czech police are also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradishtsk has been looking for since December 7th.
He's also helping British police through Interpol.
Czech woman Petr Srntsova was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
British police have been looking for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a yellow notice about her.
So the whole world is looking for Peter.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police", police spokeswoman Katerina Rendlova confirmed.
"We're sharing information on the case", she added.
The search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
He says she's 5'6", skinny, brown eyes, and long straight hair of the same color.
She's supposed to be from Uherskohradish.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such disappearances are very unusual for her.
The search for Peter was joined by a local lawmaker, Harriet Harman.
She got involved in the Petra-face flyer thing.
"We are very concerned about her", she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested one suspect.
It is not clear who he is or what he had in common with Peter.
The Czech Republic is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While the October data showed a slight decline in the attacks, last month, as the year drew to a close, the attacks intensified significantly.
We recorded a major campaign involving Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeting the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is intended to attract the user's attention by a title that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in the title, this time it was marked as Copy of Repair of the invoice for 11,2021...exe", said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last major campaign was in the Czech Republic in early August and September, and with the holiday season and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November caught more of a global-reaching campaign.
Compared to October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with an .exe extension, which was entitled REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
But the title of the invoice keeps showing up.
The Czech language annex may then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant drop and suppression of activity is recorded by security analysts for the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of the attacks and has not had a major attack campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
The modern-day demos of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The Prague parade was bigger than the media is reporting.
Based on the shorefront footage and my experience as a protester, I'm not afraid of the estimate of 10,000 people.
The marchers filled the waterfront, the bridge, and the opposite waterfront communications.
That's a lot of people.
The march of some 4,000 demonstrators is spontaneously joined by an unprecedented number of bystanders.
I say something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokry.
That the persistent discontent of several large groups or strata of the population led to a common language.
Only anti-vax, anti-smoking and the like couldn't fill or pay for a parade this big.
The action of the Hound Dog is on the rise, reminding me of a million minutes for democracy upside down.
Sometimes I get the impression they're renting the same stage and the same equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement can pay off this discontent, depending not only on the money, but also on whether Pfizer's three-dose vaccine becomes a four-dose or more.
It's definitely not going to be a left-wing or center-leaning movement, bet you.
A three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it's obvious we're going to have to have a revaccination every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant scientific feat that humanity is rightly proud of.
End of the line, Bulgaria has a new prime minister calling for change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has entrusted the formation of a new government to Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We Continue Change, which won the November elections.
It has already succeeded in forming a broad coalition government, which should take office in a few days.
The country has been in a political crisis since April, when the previous government lost the election under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
But the winning parties, which had declared a fight against corruption and abuse of power, could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one's watching?
The secret footage is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain over the weekend over the fate of the 32-year-old Czech, who has been wanted by London police for several days.
Petra Srnc was last seen two weeks ago, driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, the children's hospital worker is being called by her former employer or by a member of parliament representing the London area where she lived.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behavior and we're starting to be very concerned about her", Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very worried about her and just want to know where she is", she continued.
Missing Czech reportedly left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28th, heading home to Camberwell.
She was last reportedly seen on the bus about a half hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3rd by one of her co-workers.
According to the UK media, Srnc worked as a nurse's aide at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Group.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Peter, who is missing", a group of health facilities said in a tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help her find to contact the police", the statement continued.
The Shumper amateur painter of children's rooms Zdeněk Dvořáková Kocourková (and also the regional pirate councillor) gave an anonymous statement that she violates copyright with her drawings.
But the court found that the Moles in the Shumper Room paintings did not violate the law.
In the mouth of the Lab, a hole in the road was dug in the shape of a canal without a hatch.
It was a life.
The magistrate referred the complaint to the road authority, and since it didn't respond, the hole was still growing.
Finally, the authorities clarified responsibility and ownership, and after a month, the CSD began to deal intensively with the situation.
