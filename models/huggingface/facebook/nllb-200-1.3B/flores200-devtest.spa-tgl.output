When you're communicating with someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
Satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.

Below, there are more moderate-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (which include independent domestic cats) that feed on smaller species that exist in much larger numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats and their lives are spent within large groups called herds.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their young.

Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. When possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all their prey will be much smaller than their own size.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) through smell, smelling the soil where they have passed.
They have excellent night vision and dark vision and are also very stealthy in their movements. They hunt their prey by mimicking their surroundings and then leaping over them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) moves away from the main one from which they came (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily go back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they used to be accustomed to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it had before to be a strong competitor.

As time goes by, as the nascent population adapts to the new environment, it starts to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will be impossible to categorize them as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental part of evolution.

Of the seven wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramidal structures built to venerate the deceased pharaoh.
Necropolis of Giza, in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this type, smaller tombs and temples were erected in honor of his wives and relatives.

Top means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and bottom means you should start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull this.
The upward movement of the bow produces a softer sound, whereas a downward one is louder and more cutting.
Feel free to make your own markings with pencil, but remember that the marks on the bow instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.

They drove back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob who shouted and threw threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.

The European historical period in which these events are situated is usually known as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between the years 1000 and 1300 A.D.).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that comprises, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic that drives the destiny of mankind and that relates to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.

To give an example, one might argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily derives from the development of roads.







capital of fashion was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The culmination of the Gothic style took place in the period between the X-XI and the XIV centuries.



Subsistence farming means farming which aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family group.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic practice, which combines the use of stored seeds originating from the ecological region with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.

Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by social standards and gives them the possibility to generate a sense of identity.




Wild children
The wild child may have experienced traumatic situations or severe child abuse before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, it exhibits behaviors (within its physical possibilities) almost in a whole equal to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
e project-based learning should make that process easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, an assistance providing support to those going through a new experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual formats; to put it another way, a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, but so is the little animated paper holder in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is embedded in the software and its function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student alone.
Children are taken into care homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education, but it happens.
We can perceive that the family foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
Our foster care system aims to provide safe homes, loving guardians, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The aim of family home is to cover all the needs that were not taken care of in the home from which you were previously picked up.

Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage, can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that the abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research work of the 20th century it has been shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.

In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is the same as that of a human, to satisfy its needs for amino acids with the plant resources available.
In fact, failure to do so leads to serious problems: stunting, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
Protein in leaves and legumes would have been the most easily accessible source of plant resources, but they're not easily digestible for primates like us, unless we cook them.

lf we're not surprised if our own ancestors solved their protein problems in the same way as the savanna chimpanzees today.
Sleep interruption is the intentional awakening during the normal sleep period and falling asleep after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a more or less gentle alarm clock that will bring him back to a conscious state, albeit without waking him up completely.


The level of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.

The symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be found with an open bottle of medicines or toxic chemical cleaning products.
Read the label for specific information on the first aid relevant to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with bedbugs, a species highly developed to parasitize humans.
Killer and bed bugs are nesting bugs; they are adapted to inhabit their host's nest or home.
The number of registered cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States is about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, linking the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve, is the target of the attack of multiple sclerosis.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple might conclude that raising a baby would not be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples might choose to plan for adoption.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.

It is not, however, an experiment, it is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide scientific research.


As the dominance of the Greek language declined, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophical and scientific.
THE RITM OF BIOGRAPHY
periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate self-sustaining and have a period of free cyclical operation, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of genetic-type material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They did two experiments where they tagged phago DNA with radioactive phosphorus or DNA protein with radioactive sulfur.
depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have different effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism



In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Today, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states which has contributed to the evolution of mankind for the past two million years.


Why are there complaints of this magnitude about transport systems and why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and of the interactions between them.
nfortunately, it is not easy to study traffic flow, because it is not possible to make exact predictions about drivers' behaviour.

To better chart the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
The relationship between the two facilitates both the planning and design and the operation of the roadway devices.
The first species to take flight were insects, which helped them evade their enemies more easily and find food and mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards, gluing them to the sides of their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.

The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when you drive a heavy wagon up a hill. When you split the core again, you release some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, meaning they tend to decay with minimal or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.

Content theories focus on finding out what people are attracted to or like.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to maturity.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two factors are two well-known theories.


At the other end of the spectrum, he mutates into an unrecognizable person who feels the need to modify everything the group has been doing so far and do it his way.

Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. They therefore narrow the field of research and give it greater accuracy.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
It's long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumour affect behaviour and cause changes in mental function.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we have the ability to see and investigate structures and processes that occur in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to develop simulation models, which further our understanding of mental processes.
Though AI is often associated with science fiction, it is a highly relevant specialty within computer science, which deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
