The Republican Strategy to Resist Obama's Re-Election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
But the Brennan Center considers the latter myth to be a myth, arguing that electoral fraud in the United States is rarer than deaths from lightning strikes.
Moreover, Republican lawyers have counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, US states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the US.
That is why most state governments have passed laws since 2009 that make it harder to register or vote.
This phenomenon gained new momentum after the November 2010 elections, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights in 41 states were passed in 2011 alone.
New election laws require voters to show photo ID and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register a voter on the day of expression of will, and deprive citizens with a criminal record of the right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no US state required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
Republican officials were quick to extend the practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states requiring voters to show photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of Americans, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by their state government agency.
Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
And the cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that is not all.
Student voters who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use a photo ID issued by their school in several states.
On the other hand, those same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mostly Republican, to use the cards issued by those clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of US citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, more than a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are US citizens.
These measures are apparently aimed at restricting the voting of Hispanics.
Two-thirds of Hispanic voters are thought to vote for the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers introduced laws in 2011 that abolished voter registration on Election Day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wished to register.
This restriction has not been without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, a voter registration campaign helped to register some 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a 17% drop in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the early voting period.
In the 2008 general election in Florida, for example, 33% of early voters were African-Americans, even though the latter accounted for only 13% of the state's electorate.
The same was true of Hispanics.
Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted early.
Unlike whites, who made up 76% of voters, only 46% voted early.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters are actively opposed to laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This has helped to limit some of the negative effects.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring photo identification.
However, the new rules that have come into effect will certainly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Democratic critics decry the bias of the laws that were passed, seeing them as an apparent effort to influence the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that have enacted these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: get tested or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes produces false results, false positives, and sometimes false positives, leading to useless medical interventions.
Men who are already reluctant to undergo screening have much more reason to hesitate.
Pass the test or not?
We asked two experts for their opinion.
In studies conducted in the United States, there have been many cases among study groups, so the data are difficult to interpret and it is difficult to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found differences in mortality rates between patients who were screened and those who were not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of follow-up, that those who did not undergo screening were 30-40% more likely to develop metastases.
Therefore, I would recommend taking the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if a direct relative has prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer has been detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and sluggish.
The patient needs to be made aware of his or her cancer risk by offering him or her options, without necessarily treating prostate cancer, which is not life-threatening in the long term, and choosing, in these cases, to actively monitor the disease.
Today, many men diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
We will offer them active follow-up, and if the disease progresses, we will initiate treatment.
Increasingly, we are defining with precision the criteria for deciding who should or should not receive treatment.
So I would recommend taking the test anyway.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not to take this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of taking the PSA test.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite advances in scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
It is estimated that if all people ate healthily and exercised enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If no one smoked anymore, that figure would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are hereditary.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous damage to people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouragingly, 10 years after giving up smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight
Overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease, according to the CAR.
They increase the risk of breast, colorectal, oesophagus, pancreas, and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the association added.
Nutrition
The association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too much of it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer," the Association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer.
But, so far, the results of these studies have been mixed.
According to the SCC, vitamin E studies are yielding mixed results.
While one showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other had the opposite effect.
Estimating the impact of vitamin D on cancer development is also unclear.
However, Mr Beaulieu emphasises that it is important to discuss your concerns and family history with your doctor.
"Taking a test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
Last summer's announcement that scientists may have discovered the Higgs boson caused a stir - and with good reason.
This boson is thought to explain the mass of all particles in the universe, nothing less.
It is also the last particle whose existence was predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or at least "least imperfect," description of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not previously been scientifically detected.
But physicists are not yet entirely sure that it is the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we are dealing with a truly new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, though some data are not yet conclusive.
Let's assume, however, that it is the Higgs boson, because the chances of it being mistaken seem minimal, and see what that means.
There is, in this world, one inescapable law that says that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way around this rule, don't even try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
But while particle physics is a strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of a similar nature: the Pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consists, in general terms, of some of their characteristics.
On this basis, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called fermions, who prudently obey Pauli's principle.
On the other are bosons, a heinous gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not this principle, which means that they can comfortably be in the same place at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Laboratory's Particle Adventure site (quite extraordinary, by the way), these bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we will not talk about here, and "force particles," by which the main forces of nature are propagated, and to which the Higgs boson in some ways belongs.
These very bosons, it should be stressed, are not all as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal boson: the photon, or "light particle," which is the "courier" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when one particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in that particular place, much like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbance" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the "force carrier" bosons.
A more stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" for the boson to appear.
But the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, one must reach very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could be shaken only by a very large rock.
That is why a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - is needed to achieve such huge energies.
The electromagnetic field analogy is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact; others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to the fridge itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while others (like a photon, by the way) do not.
So what "can all this research bring," Ms Plamondon asks?
In science, they are used to test the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to detect discrepancies between observations and SM predictions.
Moreover, some of them are eager for such a discrepancy to be revealed, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door to a "new physics" and plug some of the Model's holes.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant flaws, offering no explanation for gravity (ooh!) or for the dark matter that forms roughly 80% of the universe (ooh!).
But, so far, no such discrepancies have been found at CERN.
Consequences
The benefits of these studies for the everyday life of the average person are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that they do not exist.
Look: in the very early 1960 "s, the pioneers of laser research at Bell Laboratories could not have imagined the revolution their work would cause.
They foresaw their applications in science, but nothing more.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the previous were pulsed) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen more as a "laboratory gadget."
Imagine...
In addition, an app can be found for the tools that accompany the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his 1969 optical research.
This sensor, though it was not its original purpose, now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras in the world and won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows that anything can happen.
Palliative care is the best way to die... | "Debt"
The delicate issue of the end of life was recently discussed at the Commission for Dignity in Quebec.
The debate is due to resume soon, while a bill is being drafted.
Nevertheless, much remains to be done in this critical area.
"Debt" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him from within gave him a two-year reprieve.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, you can't prepare for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet or even eating on your own.
Sitting at a table with a mouth-watering lunch, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He is cheerful, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medication, take him to the bath.
Courage in the face of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish for me to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, staff found a cure for the disease.
"Throughout our lives, we are taught that a man must urinate standing up," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
To regress to the state of a child is, for some, an unbearable humiliation.
"It all depends on a person's ability" to accept decline, he argues.
For, according to many people involved in palliative care, important events happen even in the midst of this decline.
Patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all have cancer.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months to live.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses is no longer providing what is called "curative" care.
Mrs A., 89, is most afraid of dying "conscious from asphyxiation."
But the illness allowed me to get to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life," she says, before allowing herself to be put on a breathing mask.
She is still waiting for the last visit of her son, who came from Italy, in the coming days.
At the Victor-Gadbois shelter, a group of volunteers provides body care and nutritional assistance.
This is palliative care, which remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care place for every 11,700 inhabitants.
That is very little, given that, sooner or later, we will all die.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr Christian Martel, one of the shelter's doctors.
Whether it's physical comfort, emotional comfort, or emotional comfort.
To a dying person, we will agree to provide mouth rinses of brandy or Pepsi, whatever he asks.
Diabetics are no longer forced to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr X, who died tonight.
In the morning, his son had a beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help loved ones as well as patients," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At the Victor-Gadbois shelter, no day is like the previous one.
Next to a 93-year-old man who is enjoying his last meeting with his family in the yard, sitting on his pillows as he toasts in his honour, a 36-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children, who has tried everything to survive, dies tragically.
"In the last six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois shelter come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The challenge of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is the care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stages of their lives, whether at home, in hospital or in a care home.
And some institutions, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is this large gap in Quebec's health-care system that makes many palliative care doctors wary of a law legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by palliative care luminaries Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, indicating their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health-care system is not efficient enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, "I saw a patient who had spent 14 days in the emergency room in terrible pain, and no one had taken the necessary steps to alleviate it.
I fear that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists are trying to save patients until the last day, despite the pessimistic prognosis.
Helen Richard's hopes of survival were already slim when she stopped her gruelling chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she regretted that I was stopping the fight, "she says.
At the same time, she told me that my days were numbered!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr Martel estimates that 90 per cent of patients who ask to die thank medical staff for not complying with their request after the palliative care team alleviates their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in dealing with pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, palliative care director at the Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, patients are resistant to anesthesia in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until he or she dies, either intermittently or permanently.
We can no longer pretend that we are unaware of this suffering.
Increasingly, patients who fail to relieve pain will be able to access palliative sedation.
Pain sufferers always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be euthanised," it means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Health Research Institute of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Day after day, highway officials, construction contractors, political party fund-raisers, and Italian mafia specialists tell what they know about the colossal "system" that is entangling the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists, and mafioso.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious how this system crumbles after all the money has been put into the case," jokes Jacques Duchesneau, a deputy and former Montreal police chief.
It was thanks to him that a scandal erupted in 2011 as a by-product of an investigation into malfeasance related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal prime minister at the time, Jean Charet, reluctantly agreed.
The Duchesne Report established a direct link between industry, covert financing of political parties, and corruption.
"Since the investigation began in 2010," he points out, "the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts" if some had curbed their instincts to take a stake.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already removed two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will "uncover the schemes behind individuals."
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, has joined the case, with an extensive staff of government auditors, investigators, and analysts.
And then there are the members of the special unit, the Hammers, who, after 2009, forced the Montreal wastewater cartel to stop inflating the value of contracts.
In recent weeks, a series of searches have been carried out and some municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
Next in line is Gilles Vaillancourt, who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in the awarding of public contracts.
In addition, several Montreal railway engineers and Italian-born construction contractors, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been formally charged.
The latter detonated a real bomb, telling the investigators about the "system" of obtaining government contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of Montreal contracts to a mafia-linked middleman, who in turn transferred money to Mayor Gerald Tremblay's United Montreal party.
In the 2000s, Zambito poured money left and right. He transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mostly the Liberals then in power.
He also admitted illegally raising funds for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normando.
Sewerage contracts that inflated costs
In Montreal, the corruption "system" worked smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former civil engineer, described it in detail before the commission: over a period of ten years, he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches, and bribes totalling $736,000 from construction firms in exchange for sewage contracts that he inflated.
Other officials in charge of road construction have admitted that they got away with inflating bills by 30-40% with bogus add-ons.
Then, one organizer from the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled party coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first deputies in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the Rivière-de-Prairie district in the east of the island, she has opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal plot bought for $5 million and resold for... $1.6 million to developers at the height of the construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation that will eventually be launched, she will "pull a thread to understand the functioning of a system infested with ants to stop gangrene and identify those responsible."
She describes the process as "painful but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and an observer to avoid a return of questionable practices.
How we clean at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who knew about the scheme" but were not involved in the fraud.
Given that dirty money accounts for 70% of campaign finance in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, but he says this will not change the situation: "Until we strictly limit electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He calls for a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and party funding: "We cannot go lower; having the courage to get to the bottom of things, we can build a house on firmer foundations, with better control and the rule of law."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau encourages those who laugh to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season at PSG, you have achieved an extraordinary amount.
How do you explain this increase?
This can be explained by individual awareness, but it can also be explained by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up next to them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game on a daily basis.
And during a match, it's easier.
Everything happens very quickly in football.
But I'm not disintegrating.
From the beginning at the NIF pre-training centre in Clerfontaine to my arrival in Saint-Etienne, I was always moving forward.
So you benefit from the competition set up by Carlo Ancelotti...
It is not new for top-level matches to be played this summer.
They also know that every training session is important.
It makes a player like me want to be at the level and give my best.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti supports me in my positioning.
He is assisted by substitutes like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the master of the position?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills respect in all the technical staff.
Today, he is unmatched in Ligue 1 and one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with top clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
Back then, I was coming off a series of injuries.
The trust he puts in me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of PSG's season?
In League One, Lyon took the lead.
But we are still on alert.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the last eight in spectacular fashion.
What is the club's aim in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
We will be able to have our say face to face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, to be able to host the return match in one of the eight finals.
Can PSG become a top European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for this...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and secure a long-term position.
That is not the case today.
Financially, PSG have the means to make this project a reality.
Failing to take the title in League One, as they did last season, would be a big setback?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this championship.
Last season we were close to that.
In May, it was disappointing because we had everything to finish first.
It's been a very successful season.
We finished with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points implies the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux entered the fight for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It's normal that a lot is expected of us, given how much has been invested and what kind of players we have.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and still find something to criticize, of course it's a bit frustrating.
We wonder what people expect from us in the first place.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement a game project.
The team is formed over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we can meet modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who have failed to make the last eight for two seasons, even though they have spent a lot of money!
Given the sums involved, we were 15 points ahead by the winter break.
That would be dismissive of our opponents and of the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at their best last season, have been "awakened" by this new PSG.
It shows how exciting League One is.
I hope that in May we can smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we won in the end.
PSG seem to depend entirely on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's exploits.
And what if they say that there is a certain "Zlatan dependency."
It just means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He has come in for it and he is proving he is a star in League One.
Wherever he played, he showed that he is a great player and a world star.
In the group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
It encourages others to improve their game as well.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone going forward.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
How disappointing.
I was desperate to be part of this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from getting a bit of game time.
I saw a lot of things there and I came out stronger.
I managed to play some good qualifying matches today.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine, and we must now behave in an exemplary manner.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first months in charge of the Blues?
They are effective for him.
He is in a good position in the World Cup qualifying group.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players and inspires them to win.
What a Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us for the Euros.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved 1-1 draw in Spain on October 16 is a pivotal match?
That match gave us belief in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never seen a match like it in my career.
Pay and Sell Without Banks - With Bitcoin
It is the opposite of the current monetary exchange, which is based on central banks numbering transactions between receiving parties with processing fees.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, the political vision is clear: the belief that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows file sharing among peer-to-peer participants.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been logged from 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins for donations or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin, which peaked at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later before returning to around $10 today (rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB), in its report on virtual currencies published in October, took an interest in the system.
He describes Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as the "credits" used to advance in a video game that are earned in the course of the game or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchanges are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are simultaneously ledger holders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses, like an email.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically, using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public ledger distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It passes through the solution of a mathematical problem sent to computers, the solution of which, like a temporary central bank, is granted the privilege of adding this new line.
This is the hashing phase of a file, that is, the transformation of a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it, before "hashing" it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily check that it is correct.
The transaction thus appears to be inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would alter the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, a user were willing to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), only one of these two transactions would be validated by the network - and the other would remain unvalidated because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the award is regularly split in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred million, which leaves a reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with increasing computing power.
The network has had its ups and downs.
Websites providing Bitcoin services have been attacked, and bitcoins have been stolen from reserves.
"The flaw used does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who recently launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this drawback.
Big players such as Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
A "giant sell-off" was announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works at Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, another author of the currency manual, is a firm believer in the technology's potential as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or a contactless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which is thus cheaper.
The holder has better control over his or her personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat clarifies, assuring that it already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to rethink hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
"It will be some time before Bitcoin takes hold, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, proposes, incidentally, to reconsider the various risks that are now considered to be elevated if the system succeeds.
We have withdrawn from Afghanistan.
What next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future without relying on us alone.
We suffered mainly from Afghan peasants, whom we regarded as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with the 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case under the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, and Tajiks.
They are tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, but they will no longer exist once the West becomes more delicate.
The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French loans, went smoothly.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban incursion into Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their insurmountable advance from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in flames and blood because of factional fighting.
Their takeover of the country was then seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants, in which they have been outmaneuvered by Al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today.
The former mujahedeen, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become traffickers, seizing public land to resell for development to returnees from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of huge American subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, have not even fought.
People, I have heard in the countryside, want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, just as those who have been able to benefit from American largesse will leave: capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its benefits.
Some 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
Public schools in urban areas are full of both boys and girls.
Job opportunities must be provided to these young people, who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television, and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world, and that are watched everywhere.
At the moment, there is an army.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders who waged the anti-Soviet struggle are already taking steps to restore provincial militias that would not be subordinate to the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be decentralized to a certain extent, along the lines of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially in the run-up to the April 2014 elections.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
Industry has not been brought to its feet, no dams are functioning, and no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruit.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ravaged by three decades of war, state control of infrastructure would be necessary.
Afghanistan was rumored to be rich in minerals.
This only reinforced the sense that Western countries were there only to hijack them.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper locally, without the means of transportation to export it across the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up the vast Buddhist complex and remain the province's largest employers.
It is also imperative that Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, restore normal relations one day.
The withdrawal of French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: lycée for girls, boys, French faculty at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in a bid to "win hearts and minds" and accomplish the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the "civil-military activity" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French NGO, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of local labor, were able to contain the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection, and an increase in arable land.
What will we leave behind when we spend two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often located more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in Kapisa province.
To get rid of foreign-led uprisings, as farmers have told me, they need a small amount of non-military support that is well controlled and reaches them directly.
Egypt's Difficult Birth
This is another risky move by President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration that temporarily grants it emergency powers, it has decided to play it safe.
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the following day.
Exactly one week ago, the Head of State gave the Assembly two additional months to finish its work.
Two years later, Egypt is relying on a provisional text that has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only deepened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic nonsense," continuing to "violate that word" and "flout the law."
His camp believes that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time, which forces the Brothers to abandon their intention to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy while grievances rage across the country.
Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote positively, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
All the more so because the call for an accelerated vote amounts to an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I reserve emergency powers," which are supposed to end with the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted in favor of the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not rise to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to communicate their views.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities, or civil society did the same.
In order to reach the necessary quorum, 11 reserve members were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, most of the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators were amused, incidentally, that one of the few disagreements of the day arose over... the time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the Constituent Assembly clock had been set incorrectly.
The text still being voted on yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The object of public attention, article 2, ultimately remained identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of the Shariah are the main source of law."
Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is a basic requirement, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules," which would allow for their stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," say the liberals, who see it as nothing more than a PR stunt.
Because, in their view, Islamization of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
They point in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because "the people called upon to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can see the emergence of theocracy. "
Many liberals are also aghast at the fact that the university's next chancellor is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain within the ambit of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulemas, but university-educated people, some trained in the French system, "says Alexis Blouet, who is writing a thesis on Egypt's constitutional transition.
But he admits that "there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used in it are derived from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to fiqh [Islamic jurisprudence - editor's note].
And the question may arise in the future as to whether civilian judges are competent to rule on this. "
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they are significantly smaller than they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defense budget will take place not in Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter have also expressed concern about the text, which they consider to be detrimental to freedom.
Blasphemy is still punishable and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Moreover, no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive development is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the poop of the Earth and the sea from brine
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort, and primacy of nature.
AiF has identified five of the most important reasons to visit Israel.
Let us worship the holy places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that God's grace is bestowed on all who enter this "font."
And Galilee is the place of Jesus "miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming the storm, and filling the nets.
Here Jesus also appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers here pass the Way of Tribulation or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - the Praetorium - where judgment took place, and leads through the streets of the Old City to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha - the place of the crucifixion, the Stone of the Anointing, and the place of Jesus "burial.
There is also the symbolic Christian Poop of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem is erected on the site where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest place for Jews - the Wailing Wall, a remnant of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes here with their wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a Vertical Trip
The ruins of the Massada fortress are the remnants of the secret refuge from enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on steep cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are keen on mountaineering can reach them on their own.
The rest are taken to this historic peak by a cable car.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous ski resort of Hermon, where there is a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
It is reached by a shuttle bus from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of ski slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You won't be able to visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It holds the oldest Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean desert, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artifacts.
It is also worth a visit to the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
His exhibition features works by Impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Acre, you can visit the Al Basha Baths Museum, which is a few rooms of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops.
Entry is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells the story of one of the most dramatic chapters in history.
The most tragic section, a children's memorial, was built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of Jewish children and the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is mentioned there, too.
Wellness
Israel's three main resort areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red, and Dead Seas.
Each has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea bathes even in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not drop below 21 degrees Celsius, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathes all year round.
By the way, this most extraordinary sea in the world is located at the lowest point on the planet - 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is brine, which easily keeps afloat even those who do not know how to swim at all.
The scenery around them is unrealistically beautiful.
They come here to undergo a course of treatment with salt water - rapa, and medicinal muds, and to treat dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to clean up damaged nerves.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are preserved in the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
The famous Sea Route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through it.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beauty Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander the narrow streets named after the signs of the Zodiac.
They say, if you touch the walls in the street of "your" sign, Fortune will be kind.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries for photo shoots.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can wander around the Roman theatre and "capture" the Crusader fortress.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
To the Tourist on the Note
When going to Israel, don't worry about your poor English: about 30% of the country's population speaks Russian.
It is better to take money on a trip in dollars rather than euros, which can easily be exchanged for shekels (currently $1 = 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram, and Haifa has the only subway line in the country, with six stops connecting the Lower City to the Upper City.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
All forms of public transport cost 6 shekels, for which it is possible to travel with transfers within 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, Sabbath is celebrated in Israel.
Markets, shops, and public transport are closed from Friday evening until sunset on Saturday.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels offer only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes that combine milk with meat.
There is a wide selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts made with coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus paste, various sauces, balls of ground chickpeas - falalel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are a lot of fattened cats that walk around on their own.
In the evening, they can even be seen sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Murlyks love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And it costs 15 shekels per day to rent a bike.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
In the Language of Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine were the most likely to travel and have a rest.
From January to October 2012, 118,800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the abolition of visas on February 9, 2011.
The "Great and Powerful" will bring to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While deputies and human rights activists argue that the law on mandatory language testing will give, the country has already seen fraudsters selling "fake" certificates
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their sole purpose is to earn money to support the families left behind.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every migrant worker will be obliged to pass an examination on knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and communal services, household and retail trade.
However, over time, the FMS promises, the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
Moreover, we will have to pass not only the language, but also Russian history and the fundamentals of legislation.
Language proficiency will have to be confirmed in order to obtain and renew a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
People who managed to obtain certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are also not subject to the law.
Usefulness, Doomsday, and Protection of Rights
The network of examination points will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, Peoples "Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass the tests in all cities; already, more than 160 such centers have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But human rights activists, before the law came into force, had time to ask the question in the press many times: what, in fact, will it yield?
What will change the obligatory knowledge of the language for both Russians and visitors?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service answer, it will reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery."
A lot of people are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, Head of the Representative Office of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system can solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a profession or education, who do not know the language, who do not have a medical certificate, have problems.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev is convinced, a future migrant is doomed to encounter unscrupulous people who, under the guise of assistance, will thrust a "pass" into his eerie cramped barracks, where he and dozens of others like him will languish for months without food and documents, whipping up 12-14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, they are promised one thing, and upon arrival they are deceived, their passports are confiscated, and their promised wages are not paid," confirms Tolib Sharipov, Head of the Main Directorate of Labor Migration of the Migration Service of Tajikistan.
Don't swear, scoundrel!
Nevertheless, so far, many citizens of Central Asian republics who are going to work in Russia admit that they not only do not know the language of the country to which they aspire, but also have difficulty writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, and Tajiks can afford even a basic education.
After all, their families have nothing to feed their children, let alone dress, dress, and equip them properly for school.
Growing up to adolescence, such children go to work at the first opportunity.
It's hard if you don't know the language well, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the language law, human rights activists point out one important point.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination and no formal follow-up work.
Meanwhile, most of the migrant workers are still living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or No Unauthorized Entry"
Many of the visitors claim that it is not so easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is bureaucratic red tape and the same linguistic difficulties.
Besides, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand roubles.
But a fake registration can be done quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we mainly have false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask for a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Umed Khushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, shared with journalists.
"Fly, do not skimp, buy painting"
On the first day of the Language Law's entry into force, it became clear that it was not only migrant registration documents that were forged.
Several "fake" certificates of language tests have already been seized by FMS officers.
Counterfeit papers are printed on a standard colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get them: each of the migrants, hoping to make it easier for themselves to pass the tests, paid seven thousand roubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of the official testing procedure, which will cost a migrant worker three thousand.
Both government officials and human rights activists agree that the main task in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that "crusts" cannot simply be bought.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise migrant workers who fail the test the first time, time to study a basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take up the illegal arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to toughen the law against owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: press shots at weddings, when there were no victims, and the massacre organized by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which seven people were killed.
Police want to ban the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the age at which one can obtain a gun license from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, and promised that amendments to the law on weapons would be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to combat the problem by "tightening the screws."
An open letter appeared online, the authors of which - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demand to abandon the "senseless toughening."
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov told the BBC Russian Service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 142 crimes involving the use of firearms registered with the internal affairs agencies were committed in the first six months of 2012, while 1,168,000 crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter believe that stricter legislation in the field of civilian weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the "black" market.
Now, according to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry claims that it is controlling the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The "black" arms market is replenished through several channels.
There are five main such channels, says retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who has worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site that accepts orders for weapons
The first is the "army or military footprint," that is, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Both Russian officers and Caucasians dragged the weapons," Baranets says.
The next type of "black weapon" is stolen by criminals from representatives of law enforcement agencies.
Baranets explains that this includes both those taken from police warehouses and those stolen from law enforcement officers themselves.
Illegal "guns" are being sold from military warehouses.
Explosions were frequent in many military warehouses.
"There are proven theories that some of the fires were deliberately set to cover up the shortfall," the former soldier said.
According to Baranets, the producers of weapons make their contribution.
"Now there are private arms factories that do not withstand competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the floor to the black market, including in Moscow," the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Particularly from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan, guns and machine guns come in abundance.
"It has its own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed, which organized the flow," the former soldier explains.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
A report on this in 2011 was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design.
Specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature, and open data from portals on weapons-related topics.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, come from the military and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market ended up there "because of weapons-related officials," the report said.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of armed conflict, 14% are stolen during the production of weapons, and 5% are "black archaeology."
A sales consultant at one of the gun stores, who asked not to be named, claims that the weapons found by the black diggers are too old.
More often than not, he says, sellers go to a military warehouse for a new batch.
A warrant officer buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
They prescribe it to him, they pass it through the fence.
"He takes it to the city and sells it for 900 euros a piece with two shops," he says.
"True, the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically, when the crime detection plan is on fire, they carry out a test purchase from illegal arms dealers," adds the consultant.
"Like in a luxury store"
Seller and buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at sites, blogs, until a friend responded, offering to come to Begovaya platform, where there will be a man who will take me to a "corner" where we will bargain.
I only found out the price of the barrel there
military columnist Viktor Baranets
To get the barrel, I need an acquaintance who has a way out, says the sales consultant. - I have such an acquaintance, but I am not sure about it.
There are sellers in the markets, but you also need to come there, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to be told that his daughter's tooth had fallen out."
Now I even get a couple of knuckledusters through someone I'm sure of.
He also supplies them only to me, because he knows that I will not surrender them.
Newcomers look for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranets tried his hand as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article about it.
Schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album of photographs that contained "anything and everything."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," recalls the military man.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything is possible to try.
I, a potential customer, do not just buy - we go to the forest with the seller, there we set a target.
"I am given the opportunity to shoot, and when I am convinced that the weapon is hitting well, we start bargaining," the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the sofa
Internet search engines lead to sites and groups in Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
No documents or face-to-face meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," write the advertisement cap on the website "Buy a military pistol or an assault rifle."
On it, users leave their requests and ask questions.
And the minors will be sold?
"Without a license of course," asks the user "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).
"Buy T.Moskva" - succinctly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has now spread a huge network of bogus websites and those willing to buy military weapons are shoveling away.
People go like hungry fish to feed, and then mine coal in Siberia

I have heard of such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send a photo and instructions on where the weapons are hidden," says Dmitry Kislov, spokesman for the NGO Right to Arms.
Viktor Baranets claims that leaving an application on the site, you can remain unarmed and go to jail.
The Federal Security Service has now spread a huge network of bogus websites and those willing to buy military weapons are shoveling away.
"People go like hungry fish for food and then mine coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for 100 dollars
When buying illegal firearms, according to experts, it is possible to keep within the amount of $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of Right to Arms, a Makarov gun can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
We will have to wait a month or a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the mid-level management of these warehouses.
According to official statistics of the agency, in comparison with January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22,900, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers go on strike in the US
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers work at McDonald's checkout
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests across America against low wages in Walmart's department stores and in the restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's, and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one is yet predicting whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave or whether it is destined to die out in the early stages.
The actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages paid to ordinary Walmart and fast food workers, the goal of the protesters is to create union organizations there.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "Black Friday," when America was hit by an orgy of cheap sales that captured millions of people and sometimes involved scuffles.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and picketed with unions and leftist activists the stores of the corporation, whose products are intended for people of modest and middle income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles, and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs, and milk.
Products in its stores are, on average, 8% to 27% cheaper than in major supermarkets.
So many low-wage Walmart workers only cook at their jobs.
Availability and assortment have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
Critics say Walmart can afford to sell goods cheaply in part because it pays its employees little.
The latter also complain of harsh working conditions, such as a lack of lift trucks or hand-held scanners.
Protesters on Black Friday demanded a pay rise and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation had soared from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart employee, who earns $9.50 an hour, cannot afford the expense, they said.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart passes all of the wage growth onto shoppers, each visit to the store will cost them just 46 cents more.
Over the course of a year, they will spend 12.39 dollars more than they do now.
Walmart supporters are happy to point out that the protests occurred in just nine states and did not hurt the corporation in the slightest.
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8pm on Thursday until midnight the following day, during which time Walmart sold around 5,000 products per second.
In total, its cash registers processed almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
A spokesman for the corporation, Dan Fogelman, told the left-leaning Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was just "another PR stunt" by the union organizing it.
"Free cash register!"
Protests continued this week in New York City, where they targeted not Walmart department stores (they are not welcome in this progressive city, so they are not here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and then it doesn't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work!
Jumaine Williams, New York City Councilman
At the moment, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 an hour.
Fast-food restaurants raise it over time, but not by much, and on average their rank-and-file workers in New York earn $8.90 an hour.
No one in this expensive city earns less than them.
How one can exist in New York with such money is incomprehensible to me.
Once upon a time, almost a quarter of American teenagers went through McDonald's, earning extra money behind their counters after school while living with their parents.
Few saw it as a major source of food or planned to stay there for long.
Now I constantly come across interviews with McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, a comment hangs on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them.
Protesters, who began at 6.30am on Thursday outside McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast-food cashiers and cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the fast food industry.
American law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union activists with pat-downs and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is also difficult to unionize fast food for objective reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary turnover of personnel.
Dissenters
Noisy protests were also held that day outside a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The action culminated in a mid-day rally outside McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians spoke out, including City Councilman Jumane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and then it doesn't even give you sick pay or pay you for honest work!"
The demonstrators were joined by other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor Bill de Blasio, who declared that "we must stand together in support of fast food workers so that they get the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described the incident, it was the largest such action in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people took part, and not all of them were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will ignite a mass movement.
"So far, deceiving the brain turns out to be average"
The topic of augmented reality, which is popular among fans of modern technologies, has lately been perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First, Google showed the operating model at its annual conference in the summer, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had also filed a patent application.
However, it follows from a conversation with Sharam Izadi, Head of the Interactive 3D Technologies Group at the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft, that glasses are a past stage for the company's scientists.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Please tell us in general terms what your research group is doing?
- We are engaged in human-machine interaction, but we are also trying to push the boundaries of that interaction.
So far, humanity has largely stuck with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes poking their fingers at them.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is sold without Kinect, because everyone is interested in sign control.
- What else awaits us?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has moved the interaction to the physical level, a lot still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output is not yet very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
To do this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with those wacky virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A popular thing, but is it being overestimated?
- It certainly cannot be called a panacea - there is a question of privacy, because one does not always want to inform others about one's actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each is in its own niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, not large ones, but such stingy, short ones.
At the same time, the gestures were not captured by the device's camera, but by a wristband that recorded movements of bones and muscles.
It is still large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future lies in a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- What is it like?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You will say and show at the same time.
- I usually just speak.
- Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will mainly have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately determine human responses.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If you talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, the current generation is something from which we can build in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get a megapixel 8 at 1000 k / s.
But it's not about the megapixels themselves, but about the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From the latter point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorithm designers.
That is, it is necessary to remember not only about the resolution on the X and Y axis, but also about the Z.
Speed, the number of frames per second, is also very important.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k / s is quite low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmond laboratory made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) value.
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
In my work, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful, but it does not require touching, so that there are more frames per second.
- Do you not need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cameras," one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the other a receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a normal visible range sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of an object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it by increasing the required volume of payments.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue to the Kinect, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how this will help in three-dimensional positioning.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that glasses are one of the most promising platforms in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technologies?
- Of course, it's not very convenient to walk around with your smartphone in your raised hands all the time, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be "transient" augmented reality, where, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display, and elsewhere.
Glasses are a very personal device, this is their strength (only you can see private things), and at the same time their weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from "Iron Man," but also to a mere mortal.
There is one problem, often pointed out by critics of such an idea: no tactile feedback!
Hands feel nothing!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For now, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of background for the image.
It registers clicks perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at making these "images in the air" tangible - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic beams at a certain point where the finger is located gives a feeling, but so far it is very weak - as if you have been blown on your pads.
There are also wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings in the fingers - another promising trend.
- Did you try to deceive the brain?
To make him think that he feels what he must feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another challenge that will remain to be worked on for a long time - how to make a person who is physically in a very limited space believe that he is walking on an open, almost infinite path - and we are working on the concepts of treadmills (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms, and huge balloons.
While deceiving the brain turns out to be average, the work is still many years away.
That's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their infancy.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "St. Petersburg Avant-Garde," dedicated to the citizens who are ahead in the avant-garde of culture and art.
This top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the ebullient artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red, who can be found now at the Russian Museum, now at the Summer Garden, now at fashionable parties and parties.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds of spectators, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of St. Petersburg's social and philosophical storytellers and creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80 "s and early 90" s.
Besides, he is a man of the city, who by his appearance in the streets raises a smile among the citizens and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he picked up a scarf and became a St. Petersburg sharpshooter, because he was ripe for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why do you still walk around the city in all red, not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red as a fashion designer engaged in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between artist, image-maker, and society.
In society, though, anything that is a little grey causes aggression and agitation of an unkind nature.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize that you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realised it was my way.
Back then, the wave of old, free, unofficial artists was gone, and new, free types like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with post-Gazonevshchina, which led to Pushkinskaya-10, and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into theatre, clothing, music, all genres except the word.
- And all this was united in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the center of culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I occupied the territory on Pushkinskaya-10, and there, until there was no renovation, there was a music-artistic club, a bohemian club, a house of a St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many of them were born there: NOM, Tequila Jazz, I remember when Ccord was brought with the project "Van Gogh's Ear."
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under plywood, they wore tight body stockings, among them the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs before the Hali-Gali times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went on, and he received a basic education and upbringing from us.
Gallery "D 137," club "Griboyedov - these are echoes of the Art Clinic.
This is where our employees and regulars left.
I am the hero of yesterday's century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was "People of Our City."
I was nominated Artist of the Year, and my culmination has come to an end.
In the new times, it is uncomfortable to work according to the old rules, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your works have a recognizable style.
- Many of my films are hits, they have a pronounced topicality and sharpness.
I will have a program exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now to be like that is painful and scary.
But in clowns everything is smeared, the tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through totalitarian dress-ups.
Nowadays, people are greeted by clothing, focusing on the external mechanics, rather than on the inner person.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed with the help of changing clothes.
- And recently we saw you in the role of urban charmer. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Which, like me, it should be.
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be neat, tactful, sweet.
Cultures are disintegrating.
People used to flock together, bohemians loved one thing, simpletons loved another.
Now everyone is divided into micro-communities, it's hard for everyone to like.
I'm not a hundred-dollar piece of paper to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you like.
Now each cult hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand come to Stas Mikhailov!
- It comes abandoned, where the sex-social sphere works.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't come, and as a result, there will be less management, less money, everything will be wasted.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what I have gained.
In my youth, I painted such paintings that one collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with the pictures I usually finish with.
Nowadays, concepts are often confused.
They say: spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, gave up money for painting.
I'm for that culture.
- Kirill, what is St. Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a thing: official from culture.
But not everyone can engage in culture.
Things were different under the right kings, the kings may not have understood much about culture, but they understood the need to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We in St. Petersburg have people who could be experts, but they are pushed aside, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them a path.
Now the taste buds are thriving.
Same Erarta, but what sets them apart is that they honestly say that not all contemporary art we accept, there are artists who should look for themselves in other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there are much more cultures in Moscow, there is a lot of soil there.
And it is difficult for art to grow on our stones.
We need cultural ground, and we now have more writers than readers, which is wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions and concerts.
We have a thin layer.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented with the help of a grant from Saint Petersburg
Giving birth in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of space ships with earthlings on board go in search of a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is how to continue one's species in weightlessness or on the same reserve planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be explored even hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Surdin, a senior researcher at the P.K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAIS).
But while conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, on the surface of Venus, temperatures are 500 degrees.
You can only live at a high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to approach the issues of reproduction in space with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were conducted on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then, insects were bred in orbit, tiny fruit flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to test how an embryo develops in weightlessness.
We get a perfectly normal chick out.
And then the problem begins.
"The problem with this chick is that it has to find its footing, it has to get on its feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, Head of the Laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Unable to find a support, the chicks somersaulted randomly.
After 10 hours, the newborns had complete atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to light and sound.
And there the trouble was that after four days they were just dying.
"We hatched the chicks twice and then refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychev notes the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last time a biological "mini-ark" flew into orbit with animals was 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only same-sex individuals will be on the Bion bio-satellite.
There was an experiment with rats who were sent into space with a fetus.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found there.
"It was on bio-satellites, but again it is a single experiment, and such research should be carried out," Vladimir Sychev notes.
After landing, the space rats produced offspring.
But it is not yet possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
No easy task.
Animals, when they lose their habitats, simply cannot fulfill their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, can, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a fitting emotional backdrop.
For ethical reasons, no such experiments are conducted.
But women have been flying in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the female body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could say whether it would survive a flight into space.
Will she be able to have a baby after this flight?
"After all, no one answered this question," says veteran of the rocket and space industry, Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just a year after flying into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who had been in orbit twice and even worked in outer space, gave birth to a son.
But the risk remains.
We have few, few cosmonauts, who, after long flights, got away with it, and a healthy generation is growing up.
"And if more, it is dangerous even during orbital flights," summarizes pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Yet humanity needs to find some new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, and artificial gravity.
The CPC Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their skills in open space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
Whereas for adults water, though comfortable, is still a foreign medium, for infants it is a native element.
Small ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on land came from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months old with the mother in the fetal fluid, it is easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because only 2 weeks pass from the moment of birth, from that first bathing.
"It's very little to forget," says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn child, then gravity and gravity are necessary for a woman.
Very quickly, in weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen and pelvis decay, and the ability to push the fetus falls.
Okay, let's drop that one, too, relying on birth-control stimulants.
You can, of course, go into labour in a special cell, she will push him out.
"What next?" asks Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth's pull, the body will not form a skeleton or muscle system.
It is impossible to dress a newborn in orbit like an adult in a special loading suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what he needs.
"And this experiment, which we will undertake by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled person, a completely disadapted person," foresees Igor Pestov, Head of the Bioethics Committee of the IMBP RAS.
For now, the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
In time, however, it will become a reality, as earthlings on their ships travel to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Head of the General Audit Office: The audit of the Schwarz system failed because of politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite having high-quality legislation, lags behind in its application.
This is the statement of Miroslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office, in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack," Kala commented on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are provided by a joint inspection of the Czech and German control authorities.
Peter Necas's approach to the so-called Schwartz system is cited as an example of bad practice.
Recently, the Prime Minister announced that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspections - is it banned or permitted?
"The law has to be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, then the prime minister cannot oppose the work of the institutions that are responsible for checking and enforcing commitments," Cala said.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, which compared the public procurement legislation of both countries.
What exactly were they talking about?
This is about parallel verification, which we started probably two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation states how public procurement should be conducted, followed by national legislation and then also its application in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even with the checks still in progress, interesting differences have been revealed - in simple terms, our legislation may be "precise and unmistakable," but in practice we are inferior in some respects to Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but rather to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you, what does it mean for you?
It is this kind of joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws and the reduction and improvement of restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid getting rich and possibly criminal behavior.
But it is not a fact that we will achieve this by reducing the restriction on orders.
It is possible that the system will be overflowing with "papers," so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the limit had not been lowered.
You are talking about internal problems in the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there such an organization as our CRU (Audit Office) or does it work differently?
As far as institutions are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof acts as our KRU, organized according to our principle, there is also a board that works slightly differently, but basically both institutions function in the same way.
Moreover, the powers are to some extent similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there are also audit units at the level of the federal states - in this respect their system is somewhat different from ours.
The BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the federal courts of accounts.
As for local legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare without concrete data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it is not certain that it is better in everything.
Is it because they do a better job of controlling it?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from working with our office, would they?
In terms of domestic legislation, how have the amendments to the Public Procurement Law affected your institution, and what are the consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet manifested itself in our verification work.
As we carry out factual checks, some delay must be taken into account.
We have analyzed almost 14,000 government contracts. There, of course, these changes will manifest themselves as restrictions change, the terms of some types of tenders change, and so on.
Do you think the adoption of this law will benefit or add to the burden on the bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will become "rigid" and impossible to comply with.
Under the previous rules, controlled enterprises are tied to the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - to the regional council) in that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law then be tightened in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only put even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister announced that the ODS would not bother businessmen with inspections of the so-called Schwarz system. What does this mean?
Is the "Schwarz System" Banned or Allowed?
The law must be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, the prime minister cannot oppose the work of the bodies charged with verifying and enforcing commitments.
You can say, "We will change the law and allow it," but we cannot pretend that nothing is happening.
The law on public procurement contains quite strict rules on how and what should be formally carried out, and that is the right thing to do. This will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified simply because of a technicality.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which in my opinion we lack.
Roads are sometimes slippery, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
For the most part, they are passable, but here and there they are more cautious.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning, the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but in some places frozen and snowy.
Temperatures have dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but should get a little warmer during the day.
Snowfall in the region has stopped, only a small layer lies in the lowlands.
However, the ridges of the Ore Mountains are covered with about 30 centimetres of snow.
From information received from regional road workers, it became known that visibility was reduced in places because of fog.
The R6 expressway and first-class roads in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface can be sloppy and slippery.
Also, all second and third class roads, including mountain trails, are passable.
But there are still remnants of frozen and sometimes blocked snow on some parts of them.
Particular care should be taken on highways.
Pardubice and Kralove Hradec Region
The Roads and Motorways Directorate of the Czech Republic informs on its website that some roads in eastern Bohemia are at risk of ice, and mountain and highland roads may be covered in snow.
County road workers warn drivers of ice that may form especially in the highlands of the Pardubice region.
There may be ice around Lanskrone, Usti nad Orlici, Policka, Svitavi or Vysoké Mito, especially on second and third-class roads.
I / 43 and I / 34 roads near Svitawi have been treated with chemicals.
Snow is particularly heavy on the roads of the Giant Mountains and the Orlica Mountains.
Snow-covered roads are located on higher ground in the areas of Richnov nad Kneznou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia today, there is variable cloud cover with no precipitation.
Temperatures typically range from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, with light winds.
Pilsen Municipality
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable this morning, but in places you have to be careful and adapt to the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, with temperatures ranging from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and subsequent cooling, it may be slippery in some places.
Drivers may experience fog in places, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 motorway is now passable almost without restriction, however, road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Pilsen and Tachov, there may be deliberate patches.
Secondary and tertiary roads are wet and there is also a warning of slippery patches.
Drivers should be careful, especially on little-used roads in the Bohemia region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highlands of the Olomouc region must now take into account the snow on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Cervenohorské saddle and on the road to Videlské Kršić.
Snow forced road workers to take to the streets overnight, with about three centimetres of snow falling in Sumperk, according to the Highways Agency.
In other parts of the region, roads are generally passable without restrictions.
"There are remnants of snow on the highlands of Sumperk.
Drivers heading towards Jeseník should bear in mind the presence of snow in the Cervenohorské sedlo, "a traffic controller from Šumperk Road Management told ČAN (Czech News Agency) today.
During the night, their colleagues from Jeseník also went to clear the roads, assuring them that the roads on the higher ground remained bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, roads are passable without restrictions, but in Sternberk, drivers must be careful in forest areas where moisture is still present.
Ustecky Region, Liberec Region
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia are reporting that there are still some hard-to-pass places left.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snow, the mountain road from Telnice to Klinice in the Ustecky region has been closed.
Temperatures also remain negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially to the southeast of the Czech Central Highlands, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Complications on the roads have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of ice in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation during the night - rain and snow melted all day long, the sky cleared at night and frosts began.
Unfavourable conditions have been reported on the main highways and I / 13 on the border of the Usti and Liberec regions.
Twisted tree branches on the road itself forced the closure of the Telnice nad Kninice road.
Shimon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy at concerts
What do you think is the end of the world in less than a month?
This is just one of the many disturbing news stories that we humans come across so easily.
Together with The Tap Tap, we joke about it all the time and say that we are the only band in the world that can muster enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell readers more about this?
This is a nationwide fund-raising event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of which is announced on December 21 at 11: 10 a.m.
The day before this event, on December 20 at 21: 00, three concerts will start simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, when the May calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who came up with the idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we came up with everything together with our artist Gonza Augusta.
Not only do we want to accumulate enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think with the public about the state of the world we will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world.
The Tap Tap band, together with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world called "The end of the world is cancelled."
Will the already popular YouTube anthem be played at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the end of the day, if everything works out and the end of the world does not come.
It will be sung by all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
At the same time, the anthems will also be played live on Czech television.
The lyrics to this song were written and played by the part of Jesus in the video by Tomasz Hanak, who also performs with Xindl X...
How did you begin to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities in Czech cultural life, as we hold many charity events and concerts.
We try to actively involve them in these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to?
For the purchase of equipment for the STUDEO Accessible Education Centre, we have been working with the Tap Civic Association at the Jedlicka Institute for the sixth year already.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedlicka Institute and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to their teachers, and we try to provide them with this opportunity in this way.
Within the framework of the Jedlicka Institute Complementary Construction Project, a separate building will be created in the future to which we will move with this project.
Several bands and performers will perform at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that would appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiri Suchy will perform in Prague.
For more information, visit www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such "grand events" in the future?
In May, we will be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring festival, and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would love to perform at the Czech National House in New York, and personally, if we are in the United States, I would very much like to perform in Washington and Chicago.
You have serious plans for abroad; you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the road from the point of view of organization and logistics??
It's not as scary as it first appears.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs must travel in the luggage compartment, plus a lot of cargo and tool cases.
Nevertheless, so far we have been able to cope without problems. Czech airlines CSA and British Airways have always been perfectly prepared for us, which has surprised me on so many occasions.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have you faced so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other countries where everything works better than ours, we have seen in Russia that the East is still at a basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are many barriers in Moscow, and it is still unusual for a person in an electric wheelchair to move around the city centre on his or her own.
There are also no such banal things as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there, too, public organizations are already emerging that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
Where, on the contrary, do we constantly need to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to make clear that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite normal for people with severe disabilities to move around on their own in the streets, to go to the toilet, to the museum, or wherever...
It is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this respect we with The Tap Tap are a little ahead of them!
Respect for the public or accessibility is one thing, but the moment we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians, or lawyers among us, things will really start to change.
So far, these are isolated cases - people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap band is very popular nowadays, but let's go back two years, what made you start it in 1998?
I entered the Jedlicka Institute as a tutor, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
Since I am a musician myself and also play saxophone, I and a colleague organized an interesting music club.
Well, and over time, as our presenter Ladya Angelovic says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
Popularity has only come about in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It's true, we were helped by the fact that we started joining famous singers and working actively to promote the band.
We have come to the conclusion that work that no one can appreciate is essentially as if it does not exist.
Thanks to European Union funds, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment, and so on.
Was your goal to promote The Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
Show business is full of things that mimic one another.
It is logical, everything new is taken with care, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of the person who sees us is, of course, pity, it is natural...
But this pity is entirely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and abandoned person we should feel sorry for.
They are people who can live full lives and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities succeed, it is a shift not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Did you succeed because you were a tough leader, as many people think you are?
If we want to do a good job, we must be uncompromising in many things and maintain a certain discipline.
But I think that's fine.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend training courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But this happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap band currently has twenty members.
How many were there at the beginning in 1998?
Only one, Ladya Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21: 00.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba stadium, in Brno at the Fléda club and in Ostrava in the centre of Plynojem, with the participation of 12 bands and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a teleconference during the performance of The Tap Tap's song "The End of the World is cancelled."
The aim of this project is to raise funds in the amount of 25 million CZK for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO Educational Centre at the Jedlicka Institute in Prague.
Tickets to the concert cost 400 CZK, admission is free for children under 12 years of age. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency, as the second country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began its close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and, in the years since, has actively participated in a number of the agency's projects.
But Poland's journey to space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights, but this was not always met with understanding.
Let me recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who, on December 6, 1933, presented at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his pioneering work "Introduction to Cosmonautics."
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience indifferent, and after a few years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esso-Peltry and André Louis Hirsch Prize for "An Introduction to Space."
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and written a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of cosmonautics, and his contribution was recognized, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway track equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea is unknown, as are the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket was to be used to accelerate or brake the trolley.
Information about this tree is known only from the press of that era.
From 1933 onwards, Polish artillery began to think about missile arrows.
The research was carried out by the Weapons Technology Section in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzycki.
From the preserved materials, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photovoltaic fighter rocket, proposed by engineer Rogozinsky, appeared in the specialized press, and the following year the work "Air Torpedo Rocket and Airborne Bomb Rocket" by Leliwa-Kryblocki was published.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war itself, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) coordinated all projects for the military use of missiles.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, its work was terminated by the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautics Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The society was first mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problems, which published four long articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotowicz proposed to organize a society that would be engaged in cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (POA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and in the autumn the POA became a full member.
The following year, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), the first chairman of the Astronautical Association, became Deputy Chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the POA has contributed significantly to the development of the highly successful RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, capable of traveling a distance of 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were conducted in the summer of 1959 at the Bledovskoye wasteland.
The missile was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could travel 14.5 km, and its mission was to observe high-altitude winds.
But in 1962, further development was halted.
The successor to the first RM rockets was Meteor-1, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B, and -1C), which differed in the size of the chamber for scientific equipment.
Meteor-1A had a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B 0.34 liters, and Meteor-1S 0.62 liters.
All three types had a maximum range of 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the development of the Meteor-2 rocket took place at the Aeronautical Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket, with a launch weight of 380 kg, was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR national committee two years later.
In addition, under the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslav Germaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Repealing the law on public works is not the answer.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
The ruling sparked a lively public debate.
It will undoubtedly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unfettered movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
Significant differences in labor costs (wages) put pressure on prices.
This concept should be understood as a state in which a producer, by delivering a cheap product, tries to withstand economic competition by "driving down" a competitor's value in order to take a greater share of the market and thus increase its own income.
On a mass scale, this means that most entrepreneurs either move production abroad, buy cheaply from abroad, or disappear. As a result, unemployment rises in countries where labor costs are high relative to others.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it generates, the inevitable social expenditures of the state increase.
Overall, the situation reinforces the unwillingness of business owners to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social, economic and social damage they inflict in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
The unceremonious practices of private capital create situations at the level of national economies where national governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social standard of their populations in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments leave their own populations to the mercy of private capital, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in changes to existing legislation.
The aim is to force their people economically to submit to the dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and at the same time serves as a tool for curtailing workers' rights in the area of labor law.
As a result, poverty increases, as does the gap between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, for several years there has been a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves by their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
In the context of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, there are recurrent cases in which employed people are paid so much that the state has to pay them a living wage.
A similar scandal became public knowledge in the case of additional Bundestag employees.
Economic measures in almost all of the EU's southern states undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people, under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status, are forced either to emigrate, as was the case in the nineteenth century, or to live on meager wages on the margins of society in the hope that private investment capital will one day come to the country.
But where will it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because a Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for a fraction of the European wage.
This is true throughout Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media nauseatingly claim that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital persists in insisting that the state should not intervene in the economy as a matter of policy.
The next question to be answered is whether private capital, which now practically controls politics and the state itself, is not acting for its own selfish ends.
The unequivocal answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of virtually all-powerful and omnipresent lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a desperate situation, manifested in corruption, in the provision of mutual benefits, in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that government ministries, due to lack of financial resources, entrust the drafting of laws to private law firms, which are closely connected with industry.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitution states, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly finding itself in this situation, as described by Appian in "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompeii": "The state has long since disintegrated, and institutions have engaged in violence.
Bribes, illegal obtaining of favors by means of stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without prohibitions, and people went to the polls with a pre-sold vote... "decent people did not run for governor at all, after all, one day the state was left without a consul for eight months..." "Seriously began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation was autocracy and the need to choose an energetic man...." Appian thought it would be Pompey, but it was Caesar who finally replaced democracy with autocracy.
As in antiquity, today's society is dominated by its own reckless interests, without regard for the public interest.
Private capital is no longer inherently intended for public use.
The current outcome is no different from the past: the unparalleled decline of the elite without any effort to implement deeper reforms.
So the reason for the rise of fascist and communist regimes is to be found in the reckless liberalization of the economies of the 19th and 20th centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal-type democracy can be perceived as a pause, after which the next round is expected.
Above all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
Repealing the law on public works is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition, both internationally and at the national and European levels, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social standard of the population further.
Thus, the trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state's stake in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the state, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Chaos Lab.
"Nothing comes out of violence, and nothing can ever come out" - Sting, the song "Fragile," where the main verse of the refrain is: "Don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, they wouldn't be here" - the dying Gutel Schnapper, wife of Meer Amschel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, has elicited many responses.
Some support Israel, arguing that it has the right to defend itself, while the Palestinians are terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that the Israeli state is racist, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs is genocide, and the State of Israel is portrayed as a terrorist state.
I do not want to speculate about who, in these recurring waves of killings, is the perpetrator and who is the victim, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not witness the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to offer readers a behind-the-curtain look at who is served first by 95 years of tension (counting from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small parcel of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of it derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is, first and foremost, the history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps, or whether behind their throne was someone who guided their actions toward predetermined goals.
We must accept that we are living in a period in which the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes from it could not have happened in a generation.
Among the astronomically rich families stands out one that could be regarded as the head of the spruce (I don't know if anyone stands above them, but it is not excluded): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
(Reuters) - They bought the first news agency as early as the nineteenth century in order to quell rumors linking their name to criminal activity in the higher spheres in which they were in the shadows, and which always led to the consolidation of their power, the accumulation of wealth, or both.
They have large stakes in almost every central bank in the world, and they are waging or preparing war against countries in which they do not have a stake (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Qaddafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian government took over the central bank of their country).
Anyone who tried to resist the family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the central bank status of Rothschild's Bank of America, during the Civil War he began to issue his own (understand, government) money, and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater.
John F. Kennedy, who began issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was assassinated in 1963. Representative Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for causing the Great Economic Crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the creation of a plan for three world wars by the great Freemason of the 33rd level, Albert Pike.
The first was to destroy monarchical states in Europe, the second was to end colonial domination, especially in Great Britain, and the third was to reduce the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion (enough slaves to provide comfort and luxury, and not consume many resources), create a single universal religion (ecumenism can only be a prerequisite for such a project), and finally seize absolute power.
The method by which the Rothschild-led group of wealthiest families operates is to challenge the crisis and then propose an order ab chao (order out of chaos).
But these decisions are bogus and always make things worse (see the founding of the Fed, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they succeeded in unleashing World War I by assassinating Ferdinand, the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended with Germany's sudden, militarily and economically unjustified capitulation (there was no longer a need for war to destroy tsarist Russia), and the resulting fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of World War II, bankers and politicians created a latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thereby creating a prerequisite for radicalization of the impoverished masses, then all that remained was to throw at the Germans a leader strong enough to denounce the culprits and offer simple solutions, then to create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed to play, the role of a fifth column in fanning the flames of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds instigated the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration set the stage for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
With World War II erupting, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was initially held by bankers, or whether everything he did was planned; in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the prerequisites for recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as Germany was provoked by World War II reparations, the state of Israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed of war III.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will fall victim to fighting on the front line, now alongside the Arab or, to put it more simply, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only domestically, but also internationally (take only the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless cycle of violence, when it began with the greed of individuals and their quest for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers push people to vote only for their own candidates.
Israel's current prime minister, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist politician loyal to international bankers who is doing everything to start a war with Iran that, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to escalate into a global conflict, and, given Iran's control of the Strait of Hormuz, which contains 20% of the world's oil reserves (the shipping corridor is just 2 miles wide), will also destroy the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994 now visible: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order."
The new world order, as they see it, is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocrats enjoying comfort.
A world where every born organism is implanted with a chip at birth, with which it becomes a creature under total control.
"And he causes all small and large, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
This is the wisdom: anyone who has reason can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
"Operation Argo" film: When there is nowhere to be worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student demonstrators occupied the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution to the US, which had been his regime's patron for decades.
For the US administration, a positive outcome was not expected - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it would fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
But it was unable to secure the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released after 444 days, following negotiations brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate triggered a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
Defeat in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with Ronald Reagan's election.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, "Operation Argo," chronicles an episode in that story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the embassy was occupied, six employees managed to escape.
After a difficult time, they finished their journey to the Canadian Embassy residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, aided by an extravagant cover story, according to which they left on Canadian passports as members of a film crew looking for a location in the country to shoot a sci-fi epic.
Combining genres
The plan, devised by "evacuation" expert Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
For the legend to be true, specialized magazines wrote about the film project, organized press conferences, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have long been kept secret, with the film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "film-opus," a story of a successful venture, a scam - for example, a series of films about Ocean's friends.
The mood in the film is constantly changing - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (the credits show iconic historical photos of events and how the same situations were depicted in the film - there is no great difference in this).
On the other hand, there are lighter Hollywood passages that intersect with irony and mild exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from CIA headquarters and other agencies - men in suits discussing the situation at negotiating tables, on agency staircases, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has had a wonderful career relaunch.
From being ridiculed, the actor became a respected director, and his play ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third feature film, after the dark detective "Goodbye Baby, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The City" (2010).
At the same time, this is Affleck's first film, which is not being shot in the director's hometown of Boston.
A sense of place, however, is among the qualities that elevated the director's earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in "Argo," where Teheran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scenes of the embassy's fall are impressive in their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unforeseeability that arise when history suddenly changes somewhere.
Affleck and his co-stars achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake headquarters in a Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He works pretty well with that little bit, sometimes making things up - it all comes out not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America averts a looming crisis at Tehran airport and a chase on the runway look rather far-fetched).
The downside of "Argo" is the dispersion associated with having to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as their Hollywood counterparts are indeed very charming, but their characters deserve more space, and they are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of drama, it's a film that can be watched with moderate interest, assessing the staging and retro style that recreates the thrillers of the 1970s.
But it's hard to take.
But it is enough to remind us of one, still in a sense, living story, and to show how exaggerated perceptions of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services are.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com portal, which conducts an annual survey of the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulation or project from the EU workshop."
"We were prompted by the latest development, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the administration of major European companies," Patrick Nager, the survey's organiser, told Pravo.
Among the absurdities already nominated is the recent decision by the European Court of Justice to combine the premium rate for men and women.
Until now, women have benefited from life insurance because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be submitted to the competition by the end of this year.
The voting itself will take place until the end of February 2013, "said Nager.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of bio-components to fuels, which as a result harms nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of chicken cages, which has caused egg prices to rise significantly this year.
The de facto ban on the use of the term "sandwich oil" or the withdrawal of classic light bulbs from sale was also criticized.
High-quality bananas should be 14 centimetres long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under pressure from one or another trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even defends the demands of its banks under threat of the wind).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show an "abnormal curvature."
At the same time, the European Commission justified itself on the grounds that it was only harmonizing existing fragmented national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite opposition from some states, has relaxed standards for fruit and vegetables, arguing that the existing directives will lead to wastage of products.
A candidate to win the poll could be last year's EU regulation, which requires that balloons on sale must be accompanied by a warning that children under the age of eight cannot inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has turned to American studies that suggest that balloons while playing are a potential cause of death by asphyxiation in children.
A similar restriction now applies to children under the age of 14, who are prohibited from blowing into market stalls.
Funny ideas are born at home, too
The rule concerning European officials themselves is also absurd: anyone with an official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the subject for Greece, use the name Macedonia, but should instead refer to "FYROM" (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with Laissez Faire, an association of liberal economists, has proposed for a vote, in addition to the above-mentioned absurd rules, an EU regulation on the size of food reserves within a member state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of foodstuffs that can be stored in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the EU.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volume of canned mushrooms, for which it faced a heavy fine.
The questionnaire's organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and in the idea of providing subsidies for applications for subsidies.
But these ideas originated in Prague, not Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we don't have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation, "then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palace (CSDP) declared in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain harvest, and as a result of so-called interventionist purchases, the state had full warehouses of stocks that had to be taken out.
Because the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission reached out to the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
The Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), offered subsidies to villages, including for the preparation of an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations in member states are easily criticized, the EU's efforts to regulate and to improve the functioning and development of the EU are, according to many experts, more deserving of recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is drawing EU subsidies for projects that have not even a hint of anything to do with deepening European integration, but that member states have achieved in the budget negotiations.
It is also a source of emotion among Czechs that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, retained the name "Olomouc cheeses," our producers had to rename "Tuzemak," whose traditions in our country date back to the 19th century.
Only products from cane distillate, not sugar beet, can be called rum.
In addition to the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma ham, the official list of registered EU products already includes, for example, Karlovy Vary rusks, Pohorzelice and Trebonski carp and Zatec hops.
Pardubice carrots and Gorzice pipes can also be proud of the EU trademark.
People want me to protect the republic, but I'm an amateur, "Okamura said.
Mr. Senator, how does it occur to a person to run for president?
I am not thinking about becoming a senator or president myself.
If everything functioned smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country being plundered over the past 20 years, thieves hustling around, people raising their taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And because I am in my forties and an independent with no party affiliation, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Are you turning your back on the people who elected you in this way?
I have said all along that I will enter the race for the presidency depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
Later, I specified that if I was elected a senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a post; a post is a tool with which I can implement my views.
So I need the greatest influence and the broadest powers.
But the difficulty is not just that, as a nation, we grumble in front of our bars or the TV, but that we are prepared to trample on anyone who tries to change something.
Then there is the media, which denigrates people and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it was said that I paid bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiri Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
You started the fight for the presidential castle with theses about the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and about the return of property declarations worth more than twenty million.
To achieve this, the law must be changed.
As president, you have no such authority, and only the entire Senate can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I lobbied as a citizen to make tours a free enterprise, it was pushed through.
The problem is politicking - when someone comes with a good offer from the left or the right, they are deliberately obstructed, and this holds back citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan person, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from every party what is best for our country, and apply it, without putting it on the shelf, without looking at dogma.
Do you see yourself as more of a right-wing or left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people regard me more as a leftist.
For me, it doesn't really matter whether it's a little left or a little right.
It is important to me that we move forward.
It's not about who is on the right and who is on the left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good solution for society, whether proposed by the HRCM or the ODS, and I will likewise oppose a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it with what you said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already functioning in the world, or are being talked about by eminent experts.
But without the support of parliament, you will be left with only slogans.
And you won't last long in politics with that.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to exercise criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other option.
Only convince politicians, journalists, and the public, and try to lure them to our side, so that we get our way.
If I were elected President, it would not be a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would appeal to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to explain why they do not want to do so.
If there is a strong personality who speaks out about abuses, then pressure can be brought to bear on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was a result of public pressure.
I say outright that I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am just starting out in politics and I will try to get majority support for my agenda.
I try to promote things on my own; if that fails, I will finish in six years and return to the private sector.
It sounds, in part, as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am no saviour.
I know that I alone won't do anything, so I've bypassed a number of famous people to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchura, who refused because of the volume of work.
I also at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencova, who uncovered fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put myself forward because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel like I'm in the balance.
Sixty percent of people did not go to the polls, and most of those who did chose representatives of the establishment.
There are only two of us independents in the Senate.
People have elected the Senate in a way that changes will be difficult to implement.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about founding your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the purity of every potential supporter's background, and I don't have the money to do it.
There is no money for the presidential campaign either, my transparent account has only twenty thousand CZK.
Do you have no money?
You are talking about property declarations, but what about your own affairs with this?
Personal assets are estimated at around 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth a million, and a few million more in my account.
I got an Aston Martin, by the way, because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove a car, was gallant with women, and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, own a £60 million property and have no money for a campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
This is not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for a campaign.
Should I get into debt?
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not that interesting.
And I am not obliged to pay for an election campaign out of my own pocket.
My campaign costs will essentially be covered by my Senate salary.
But I wouldn't live on that money, for example, I wouldn't be able to pay my son for an English school that costs $30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running.
So, will you continue to be an entrepreneur so that you can live?
Did you not say that you would reduce these activities?
But this does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I have reduced my activities in part.
For example, my deputy will become managing director of a travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be an imperial guardian of the republic.
But I also have to live on something.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to receiving monthly?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I still get.
And if I were president, I would finish my business.

MVRDV architects prove that true adventure is not just about imagination - Spijkenisse and his newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I find this building fun, it looks futuristic, and finally we can see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig as she passes by on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, thinks so: "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself: why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPads, and e-books.
Nobody goes to such old-fashioned libraries voluntarily any more, right?
Spijkenisse, an unremarkable sleeping town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this unfortunate circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to build seven fictitious bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of painstakingly painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this outreach initiative has been modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they had only one opportunity to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Winy Maas of Rotterdam-based architecture firm MVRDV, a master of bold bar charts and author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, approached the task with his usual composure and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
As the jury looked around in bewilderment and shrugged, a defiant Maas folded a pyramid in size out of his original gift and ended his speech defending his project with the words: "Dear townspeople!"
Here's my suggestion: "Book Mountain" in Spijkenisse, the so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain, worth €30 million, has grown.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent apartment buildings and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, "Book Mountain" was awarded the second prize of the competition "The Best Library of the Netherlands 2012."
The project also participates in the Dutch National Wooden Structures Competition 2012.
Thus, a faceless suburb that once had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall whose white facades suggest a dairy plant has become richer in one modern piece of architecture.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse has the first public cultural building in the town's history.
A Long Road to the Book
First impression: a bookish Eldorado under a cheese hood.
There is only one elevator in the middle of the mountain range, because true lovers of architecture and reading will prefer to explore the area on foot.
The glazed room from all sides is bright and easy to see, the floors of burnt brick and the elegant street lamps unmistakably create the feeling of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfectly recreated.
The gaze is involuntarily looking for benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Normally, bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark room, usually uncomfortable and faceless," says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic space configuration upside down and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The inner space of the Book Mountain is skillfully used: in the center there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and technical rooms.
Particularly pleasing are the black bookshelves, which serve as wall finishing, parapets, or stairwell railings.
Their appearance, texture, and smell are unusual.
Even seasoned architects and civil engineers are lost in guessing what the unknown material is.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Traborst, the project manager representing the Spijkenisse community, as required by the standard.
And one day, at an agricultural enterprise in Friesland, we came across a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, millimetre-thick artificial fibres have been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a root lining.
This is cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles last for one or two seasons, after which they can be thrown away.
For the library, the cloth - for the first time in such volumes - was pressed into panels four centimetres thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material that smells a little like a new car and a little like a pair of sneakers.
105 steps lead to the top.
Whoever makes the 500-metre journey will be rewarded in the literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the right humidity on the literary mountain.
The Costs of a New Soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite a lot of glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Troborst.
Earth's heat is used to heat and cool it.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glass cap, even on clear days, the sun does not get inside for long.
Wide laminated wood farms perpendicular to the glass facade provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roll blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned IT skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig has been here before, too.
And traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "Spijkenisse's soul that has long been missed."
The reason: a few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from their own collection.
These books were supposed to fill the empty shelves of the not yet fully staffed library, which had 70,000 books at the time.
The idea worked.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident is now connected to this new house in some way.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it serves only for decoration.
In this way, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which in professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote his own literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It is, after all, only a starting point for identity-building.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on recognition of Palestine.
In doing so, Berlin is balancing a narrow diplomatic path, according to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany initially signaled that it would vote against the Palestinians "application for observer status at the United Nations.
But Berlin then abstained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But, at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO carried out the proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, moving from a US-led policy, so to speak, to German foreign policy itself.
Complicating matters further, Europeans lack a coherent common policy.
Thus, the Germans are once again caught between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that for now they are just figuring out their role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy as that pursued by France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It is a willingness to take a position in its national interest that is independent of that of the US or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and ties to certain regions, such as Russia, China, or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are very different from those of other major states, and Germany must therefore defend its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It must therefore be careful not to offend public opinion and elites in Arab countries.
Either way, it plays a part.
But I wouldn't place too much emphasis on it, it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the Germans "calculations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining from important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe, and even in the US, understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don't think it was as dramatic a fracture as the Libya issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect in this way.
After all, it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
Opinions differ in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The US, by contrast, has made clear its support for the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European states?
Because of American domestic politics, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has a deep understanding of the European position.
But, given the local political situation, the government cannot, of course, take such a position openly.
I believe that the significant differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem to be.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all enthused by Netanyahu's policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand, and its position as the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that is what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a single, coherent European policy, but that is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot speak from a broader perspective and must instead act on the basis of their own vision.
That is what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in forging a common European position.
Understandably, this is not easy for Germany, if only because of its ties to Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it really assume a leading role?
Or is the lead still being given to Germany?
Germany is not yet used to this, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, still finds it difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany assumes an important role, a variety of anti-German sentiments manifest themselves.
It is not easy for the Germans to cope with this.
Actually, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much worse position than the US.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
So, the US influence in European politics is steadily diminishing, but at the moment the EU is not filling that vacuum, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a larger role.
Even if you don't like it, dislike it, or hate it even more - that's life!

"Trademark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
It is an officially registered name in China that has nothing to do with the firms from whose names it is derived.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names file a lawsuit.
Even then, it is unclear whether they will be able to assert their rights.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing who specialises in trademark infringements in the Far East.
Every week, a new case of this kind comes to my desk.
Simulators need only add a couple of letters to be eligible to register their trademarks.
So Gucci turns out to be Lu-Gucci, Prada-Kny can be registered instead of Prada.
German companies, such as sports goods maker Puma, are being legally copied in the same way.
Pattloch opens a folder with the records of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered there the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also uses the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property rights.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey department stores selling almost exclusively counterfeit goods.
However, Pattloch's case is different. On behalf of his clients, he opposes Chinese enterprises receiving from the trademark registrar the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Ban Mingpai," a brand-name passenger.
The word is associated with "Ban Dakuan."
This is the name given to women who prey on rich men.
Chinese authorities plead not guilty
"It's damaging to business, it needs to be addressed," Pattloch said.
"The brand is being eroded, a unique position is being lost, the image is badly damaged."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries run into the millions, especially in the case of expensive copyrighted products.
According to market research firm CLSA, with sales of €15 billion a year, China is the third-largest and fastest-growing market for luxury goods.
However, deleting dubious entries in the trademark registry is difficult and costly.
The process can last up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch recounts cases in which the court dismissed claims because, after a long time, the contested name became a "market reality."
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his trademark in China, Pattloch said.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also the famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that had recently acquired concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The company that bought Volvo, Geely, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost out in China to imitators in Hong Kong and Singapore, where the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be at fault.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to a shortage of staff and equipment.
But last year, there was a "return to normality from an emergency in the work process."
For example, the backlog of objection cases has fallen by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been closed, a 75 percent increase from last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending before the agency.
Fighting it is expensive
As is so often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, nearly a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China topped the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the agency reports.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were paid.
Simplified, this means that each registration costs, on average, 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
It costs many times more to challenge it, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans succeeded in eliminating his illegal production of counterfeit automobile parts.
However, the imitator has secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was an omission of its own, as surnames are not protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trademark office rejected the Munich claim.
True, Freudenberg won in both subsequent instances, but the opposing side continues to struggle to this day.
You need to be on your guard
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a successful conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerve."
The internal costs are barely measurable, and the firm's archives even had to look through 100-year-old records to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a "large six-figure sum in euros" for the settlement.
"This shows how costly it is for us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spill over even into Europe.
Namely, if imitators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the Freudenberg brand for shoes and leather goods.
The concern stopped production in these areas long ago, but still managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be alert," says Wentzler.
Both he and Pattloch advise German businesses to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark protection regulations; rather, foreigners should "register anything worth protecting in China as well," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registering.
Indeed: if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposing party the licensing fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we will be pushed out of the market in a contested segment.
World AIDS Day: stomping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of relations that have overcome a distance of more than 8,733 kilometers.
First comes the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boats and men's slippers pick up the pace on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singers - viola, bass, tenor, and soprano - slowly build up - they step, charm, and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, nearly leaps out of his cloth shoes as he conducts them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty members of the choir, ranging in age from 23 to 69, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor, came to the rehearsal.
"Om" Obani "is a complicated thing, each voice of the choir has its own text, and in a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self-Help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS program, estimates that there are about 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland is home to 245,000 AIDS orphans.
And more than 40 percent of the population is HIV positive.
Voices for Africa has found mentors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of them attend a school that prepares them for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take over the sponsorship.
It guarantees a child money for school, school uniforms, and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu means narrator or praiser.
In this hall they don't speak Bantu fluently, but they know how to sing.
For almost a decade, the choir has been learning songs in this foreign soft language, and from time to time has even brought them back to where they first appeared: southern Africa.
After all, 8,733 kilometers away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, and there are many children among the residents.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the IS virus.
In Esitjeni, a miniature depicts the disease of the whole of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the foreskin in men, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost uncommon in the population.
More than forty percent of Swaziland's population carries the immunodeficiency virus, and deaths in the mid-40s are not uncommon.
The choir opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before that, Imbogni members saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment by individual participants - for a few euros a year to send a child to school and allow him or her to receive a hot meal once a day.
A year later, however, the choir founded Voices for Africa, which has since become an almost professional provider of care for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and tripper (gonorrhea).
Frequent viral STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, and hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (a fungus), gonorrhea, and the human papilloma virus.
HIV prevalence among heterosexual adults is relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are significantly more common than among other population groups.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
We also have a high incidence of human papilloma virus among young people.
How is the number of infections changing?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
The incidence of syphilis has more than doubled, from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011, according to the Robert Koch Institute.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one-tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, urinary complaints, discharge, lower abdominal pain, and blisters or lumps.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
After all, some of the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact infection and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular screening, especially in the case of frequent changes in sexual partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid long-term consequences.
Sponsorship, donations and not least royalties for the choir's performances throughout Germany help raise some money.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a conscientious and active woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also makes sure that orphans are well cared for, for example, by one of their grandmothers.
Gogos, as the old women are called in Zulu, is a pillar of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, provide them with a roof over their heads and ensure that children in uniform show up in time for classes every day.
Those who have no family left join the shelter to Haniysila, a single woman who receives a salary from the association, as do two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa established a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and, together with the American health organization PSI, organized HIV testing for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, is preferred to remain deeply silent.
The King with 14 Wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it is related to sexuality."
This is unusual in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
Sub-Saharan Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excess.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, this state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the spread of the HIV virus so quickly in past years.
But it also falls on the vagrant workers who carry the virus around the country.
Free condoms are available on literally every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The other culture is flesh to flesh. "
To encourage a bit of cultural exchange, the Ibmogni Choir travels to southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of the sadness, fighting spirit, confidence, and black identity that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in black language - this recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but has even, at times, brought tears to the eyes of the tough border guards.
The trip always leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit sponsored children.
Although the small village is hard to find on a map, it is more than well known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's light," say the people here.
And after the 8,733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the stomping singers return to the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Street, you can see that the light is on here, too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
Ice sheets can be up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, it also has frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that the planet's permanently shaded region is covered in ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimetres, perhaps even up to 20 metres.
Presumably, the water comes from a comet or perhaps an asteroid colliding with Mercury.
No one is linking the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the probe's scientific director, Sean Solomon.
Temperatures on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
But these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life got to other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth's inhabitants, probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small windows into the infinite distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet," according to a new definition by the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This fragment of the Spitzer telescope's infrared image presents a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in the form of blue dots, and pink "newborn" stars are harder to identify in the star circle.
This star-forming region - unromantically called W5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light years away.
This spilling heat of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The doughnut-like ring consists of material that the star threw away in the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years away from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope captured this photo of the galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with a telescope, the color works better.
Like a red eye blinking to an observer, the Snail Nebula in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years away in the constellation Aquarius.
The similarity to the Earth's continent has earned this nebula the nickname "North America."
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides an expressive colour rendering.
It was only possible to photograph this new star in all its beauty with the help of the Spitzer telescope's infrared sensors.
Saturn and its rings: How they came into being is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the remnants of Saturn's moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the Hubble telescope's greatest and sharpest images: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color rendering, images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the Sagittarius constellation several thousand light years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-longitudinal, three-separated), as dark dust bands divide the hot heart of the cradle of stars into three parts.
In the Serpentine constellation, astronomers have photographed the harbinger of a cosmic collision: 400 million light years from the Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies rush toward each other and inevitably collide.
This star birth was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who don't like technical acronyms might call it the "Southern Chain Wheel."
A photo from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, 1,400 light years away, consists of dust particles that are ten to one hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was made up of optical and X-ray images from various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light years away from Earth.
This cluster of galaxies, called Arp 273, was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the large spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This star nebula contains the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The cradle of the stars constantly creates new stars.
This stellar cloud, connected to the Rosetta Nebula, also constantly creates new stars - 5,000 light years away from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it originated shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was largely hydrogen-rich.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgay - even before Galileo Galileo began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown larger - and the space available to them has deepened.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror shown here had a diameter of five metres.
Arizona, USA, has a Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias has a gigantic internal structure - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The mirror of the Large Southern African Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to reduce costs.
Nevertheless, it is about eleven metres in diameter.
The disadvantage of inexpensive design: the telescope is rigidly fixed at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its special feature is its high light-gathering capacity.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening for extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by contributing his or her computational power.
A view of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the "Very Large Telescope" - fully in keeping with its name.
Its four mirrors allow even the middle infrared spectrum to be illuminated in the optical tube.
The European Very Large Telescope is also planned to be installed at the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror is to span a full 42 metres - and will be made up of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the photos are not expected until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten metres each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks to the sky with the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a giant new telescope is due to appear on Mauna Kea - with a mirror with a diameter of thirty metres.
Here you can admire them in the illustration.
However, the most important views from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been supplying paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system - especially those where life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the mission began.
This photo shows the final preparations of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be sent into space until 2018 at the earliest, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search the light of the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists suggest that there is ice at Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as Messenger rotates closer to the planet's north pole.
Radar measurements over decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, launched in 2004 - the first to orbit Mercury - scientists are now confident.
Drink butter every day - and live to 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Finding a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Finding a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
The ride through the Talysh Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
A minibus rumbles down a winding road past densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything around is so green and bright that you would think you were in the Black Forest.
But it is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the Talysh, one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about whom not much is known, except that they speak excellent Farsi and Azerbaijani and are distinguished by their longevity.
The final destination is Lerik.
The small town boasts too heavy architecture of Soviet times, which does not at all harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
The 323-kilometer journey takes eight hours, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerik.
"In May, Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will have a festival of the world's oldest people," Fatulayeva says.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the biography of about eight dozen Talysh people from these places, who are more than 100 years old, is documented. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he is 120 years old here.
At the age of 136, he had another child
But the museum's controversial star is Shirali Muslyumov's shepherd, who is said to be 168 years old.
There is, however, no birth certificate.
And, given that the oldest documented person is 122 years old, Muslyumov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and allegedly had a daughter at the age of 136.
So has the shepherd Muslyumov added a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of centenarians in Central Asia.
"An astounding number of elderly people can also be found in parts of China, in Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "Sardinia is also home to an extremely large number of very old people."
However, in the absence of documentation, scientific proof of age is impossible, as there were no civil registers.
A glass of melted butter every day
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the Lerik area are strikingly often of biblical age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age living here.
Why are there so many centenarians here in the south?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by special Talysh genes.
Director of the Fatulayeva Museum, on the contrary, believes that it is all about nutrition.
Talysh people love meat, bread, and most of all dairy products, many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it a primitive way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzoeva lives in Chengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik.
At 97, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of butter, which she rolls tirelessly back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and daughter, who have long since had grandchildren of their own.
There are also two toddlers jumping nearby.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared and served in typical bubbly glasses of armudu.
Mirzayeva has perfectly smooth and strong white teeth and hides long dark blond braids under her headscarf, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always wash my hair with milk so it never falls out and retains colour.
"And I've never used shampoo," Mirzayeva says.
A monthly pension is enough to live on
She always ate only what she had grown in her own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I have never bought groceries in a store in my entire life.
Then she talks about her husband, who served in the military.
The worst was after World War II.
But it became better when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the helm.
Propaganda is not often heard in an old woman's speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows almost no borders.
He remained in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took the reins.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among Azerbaijan's elderly.
Mirzayeva receives 230 AZN (roughly equal to the same amount of euros) monthly as a pension, which is an amount for local conditions to live on.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-grown son is also right: "The elderly are deeply respected in our culture."
They live with a large family, are loved, cared for, and happy.
What's not a reason to stay alive for as long as possible?
The word "human right" is absent from the constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Competing demonstrations in Cairo reveal the country's deep divisions.
A future constitution based on Sharia law has been fiercely opposed.
The Egyptian president has not been short of pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And its success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but first and foremost to the Coptic Christians, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile is at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologetically, said that he had temporarily curtailed the competence of the constitutional court and expanded its competence "to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save is unclear to Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be stripped of its power?
In fact, 234 articles were pulled in a 15-hour late-night steeplechase at the Islamist-dominated 100-member constitutional assembly, raising some concerns.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that judicial proceedings are based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles" mean?
This has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that Islamists will use the vagueness of the formulation and the resulting legal leeway to interpret Sharia more strictly.
At least one new article hints at this: in all matters concerning Sharia law, Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamist institution and one with great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be brought before the council.
This should not, but could mean that the clergy oversee legislation, which would de facto limit the judiciary's power.
Much is open to interpretation in the draft constitution
Another problem is that the jurisdiction of the military court over civilians must remain.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress opposition.
Up to 11,000 civilians have been held in military detention since the dictator's overthrow.
Also, as the draft says, the state must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "uphold its morals and values."
Legally, it is formulated in such a vague way that state institutions will be able to control even the content of films and literature with the help of this article.
In plain language, this means nothing less than censorship.
Indeed, no article explicitly establishes the equality of men and women.
But the other prohibits insulting and defaming the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what constitutes an insult, and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
The wording that "insulting people" is prohibited is also questionable.
Will a caricature of the president or a joke about a jurist suffice?
The question of interpretation, like much of the draft that Morsi is proposing for signature, which he says will be submitted to Egyptians for a referendum "very soon."
"The Revolution is Back"
For weeks now, an opposition has been forming against the supremacy of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who finished third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said the draft constitution was "on the scrapheap of history."
Via Twitter, he accused Morsi loyalists of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy."
"If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and knock him down," opposition leader Yasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges have also indicated that they do not want to observe the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for a counter-demonstration, but, as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of veiled women and Salafists, who shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Morsi: "Cleanse the country!" and assured: "The Koran is our constitution."
The power struggle over the symbolic square where it all began triggered a state of near-civil war.
Morsi's followers obviously did not want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
A majority in favor of the Islamists "project is considered a done deal.
"The notion of 'human rights' is not mentioned once"
Hafiz Abu Sayeda is furious at this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February, with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights were indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the word "human rights" does not appear once in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with Welt am Sonntag.
Morsi's expanding influence over all three branches of government in the state is disappointing.
These measures are clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president has de facto annulled it," says Saeda.
After all, without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has abandoned him, even the international community, which views the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be a price to be paid for this.
A demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: "You are creating a monster that you cannot control."
Norwegian rakfisk: the world's smelliest fish?
Norway's five million people have one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe, but throughout the world.
Perhaps the secret of this country's success has something to do with a local addiction to one extremely smelly fish dish?
Take a few overripe slices of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get a whiff of rakfisk, one of Norway's most famous delicacies.
I am in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
There are scenic views covered in snow. It is very beautiful, but there is an irresistible distinctive smell in the air.
Rakfisk is trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for up to a year, depending on what kind of choke is needed.
As dusk falls and it gets cold, crowds of Norwegians flock to the festival in Fagernes dedicated to this most, shall we say, exciting of dishes.
"It's eaten raw and drunk with a glass of aquavit, the local cumin vodka," explains Havard Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and part-time "rakfisk general" who runs the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat diced fish and drink large quantities of alcohol.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," says Howard.
This drink can beat the smell.
I try a couple of pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not that bad - it's not much different from a portion of sushi you've had on a bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a very different time, a time of poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish were soaked in hermetically sealed barrels of salt water in the autumn.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish was well and truly fermented, it was extracted and, muted by alcohol, eaten.
In memory of the last generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate, mainly to the US.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by jobs, high wages, and a well-developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (a long-time rival and, more recently, a much more prosperous neighbor) come here in droves to work.
Rakfisk is seen as an important symbol, an indispensable, if somewhat smelly, element of Norway's past.
It is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the world's news, and most people seem to be comfortable with it.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist and extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning him by name, the attack is called "what happened on July 22."
Norwegians find it hard to believe that, in their peace-loving country, one of their fellow citizens is capable of such atrocities and killings.
At the heart of Norway's current prosperity is the growth (since the early 1970s) of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress carrying trays of seasoned rakfis, a woman with long blond hair and strikingly blue eyes, the epitome of Nordic well-being.
We are the kind of people - as you call them - that are sensible.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks excellent English.
We don't like to show off, we're not boastful.
Norway treats its oil very carefully - most of the oil and gas industry's revenues are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was throwing away money they didn't have, Norway was frugally calculating the costs.
"As long as you can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, that's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's rakfisk," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm queuing in the snow for some food - I've had enough of it.
Here is a burger with elk meat - it is certainly exotic, tasty juicy meat.
But in the evening, more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell awaits us.
My hotel hosts a special rakfisk dinner, during which visitors vote on the best, or perhaps the most aromatic, fish.
There is a live television broadcast, which shows the presenter in a bow tie surrounded by plates of rakfis.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jürgen, what rating did you give for the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment..."
Everyone is laughing and cheering.
Someone falls from a chair, possibly after getting over an aquavit.
Or maybe it's just the smell of that fish.
Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto faces a difficult start to his career.
As Mexico's newly elected president, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant takes a look at the challenges he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad right now.
The city is also congested at the best of times, and steel fences have been erected since Monday, cutting off several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not to prevent people from commuting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from reaching the parliament building.
On Sunday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will wear the presidential armband and take over the reins of the country.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico has performed well economically under Felipe Calderón's outgoing administration, but the country is mired in a drug war that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government tells the people of Mexico that it is ready to fight violence," Mr. Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House earlier this week.
I intend to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Before such statements, Mr. Peña Nieto's political career developed alongside that of the US president as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and vast state surrounding the nation's capital, opinion on the new leader is divided.
The Straight Man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, he is remembered fondly.
Residents credit him with reviving tourism, developing the resort sector, and creating infrastructure.
The city is reachable by one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new highways, which are strikingly different from the potholes and pits that were previously in place.
Plaques bearing his name hang on a modern sports centre building and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are pinning our hopes on him for real and serious change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman for Peña Nieto's PRI-led Institutional Revolutionary Party.
We look forward to the real and decisive change that our country desperately needs, particularly in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 consecutive years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that, after a 12-year absence from the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
Moreover, he refutes the opposition's accusations that the new president is devoid of substance.
He is very straightforward and very committed to his vision for the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, a man who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different view of the former governor.
The municipality of Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, stands in stark contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under motorway flyovers, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe in this megalopolis.
Earlier this year, troops were deployed to quell drug gangs in these areas, and violence against women is particularly acute.
Dozens of bodies of murdered women have been found in wasteland near a vast landfill in the last two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during Mr Peña Nieto's governorship - far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juárez, which has become a household name when it comes to killing innocent women.
According to Mr. Peña Nieto's opponents, he has, at best, failed to address the problem of femicide during his tenure as governor.
At worst, his administration is accused of turning a blind eye.
Irinea Buendia, a resident of a concrete house that resembles most of the houses in this run-down neighborhood, struggles to hold back tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner killed her.
"When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed," Ms. Buendia recalled.
There were signs that she had been beaten and her body was already dead.
Mariana's mother recounts the story, and a portrait of her daughter looks down at us from the wall where it hangs next to a crucifix inscribed with just one word: justice.
That, they say, was what the family was denied.
"State officials treated me like an old gossip, a disgruntled troublemaker.
They want people to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
But it's wrong, it shouldn't be, especially when there are so many violations and flaws around, "she said.
By wearing the presidential armband on Saturday, President Peña Nieto will shoulder a heavy responsibility with her.
Tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime over the past six years, and the new president has promised to make tackling the problem a priority during his tenure.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as he was as governor," said Olvera, a PRI congressman from Valle de Bravo.
But that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about mistreatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's claims of poor detention conditions.
The hearing focused on Manning's time at the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense is seeking to dismiss the case on the grounds that Manning's detention conditions were harsh.
A US Army private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution sought to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in US history, did not take advantage of multiple opportunities to file a complaint about the mistreatment he said he suffered while in a military prison.
Under cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland, the military prosecutor, Maj. Ashden Fein, said records of Manning's weekly visits by prison officials during his nine months in Quantico, Virginia, contained no complaints of mistreatment.
The cross-examination, as part of a defense motion to dismiss Manning's case on the grounds that his conditions of confinement were harsh and in themselves sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning said he intended to commit suicide while in custody.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was subsequently published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
During Friday's hearing, Fein, along with Manning, reviewed reports that were filled out after administration officials visited Manning during his time at Quantico, where he was held under high-security confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Fein asked about the reports Friday, Manning acknowledged that he found the treatment by prison officials "excellent" and the overall conditions of confinement "very professional."
The reports reviewed do not contain complaints of mistreatment, even though Manning was asked directly about his conditions of detention, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had expressed verbal concerns about the issues and that visiting administration officials had discussed them with him and said they would be addressed, but did not record them in writing.
"They wrote down" no problem "(after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise the issue in the conversation," Manning said.
The military judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his mistreatment in January 2011 during a hearing of a commission examining suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing months earlier.
Manning said that during that hearing he wanted to have his "injury prevention" status lifted and his conditions of confinement relaxed.
Military officials explained that the restricted confinement regime - a level lower than suicide prevention supervision - was introduced to protect the detainee as well as the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I was fine, that they would repeal the injury prevention regime... that my standard of living would improve, from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had suicidal thoughts in Kuwait and that he once lost consciousness because of the heat.
He explained that it is psychologically very difficult when you are not allowed to know how your fate is being resolved and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world has shrunk to Camp Arifjan, to the size of my prison," Manning said Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
While at Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day - alone.
Manning says he was allowed to leave only a mattress, blanket, flip-flops, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move because sleeping or even just lying down during the day was forbidden by the rules.
During his sleep, Manning said, he was constantly hit in the eye by light from outside his cell.
If guards didn't see his face when he rolled over in bed at night, he said, he was woken up and forced to roll over on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to Manning's mistreatment in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about a statement he made during Thursday's testimony that after being forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates for a morning check.
Manning said he was unable to cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
Under questioning from the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he had to drop a blanket that could have covered him, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning said Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could have used underpants or flip-flops to injure himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning testified, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hope the judge will at least take into account what he went through during his incarceration and significantly reduce his sentence if Manning is convicted by a court-martial, which is due to begin early next year.
The defense has said it plans to ask Manning to plead guilty to lesser offenses and contest other charges as excessive.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon says Manning was held at Quantico under rules governing maximum-security detainees.
Manning's charges include aiding the enemy, unlawfully facilitating the release of data on the Internet, transmitting information related to national defense, and stealing government property or documents.
If convicted on all counts, he could face life in prison.
My crisis of national identity is the story of a Mexican-American.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of a lack of opportunities for self-fulfillment.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarrette believes that Mexicans of American origin are torn between two cultures.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the arrivals corridor, approached the border control area, and stood still.
Signs pointed to two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the other for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California and have been called Mexican all my life.
It's just a conventional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish and my friends in New York call themselves Italians.
Later, I focused on the complex construction of "Mexican-American."
But here I was in Mexico.
There was no need for conventional names or complex structures here in my grandfather's homeland.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than native speakers, and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took out my American passport and queued for Extranjeros.
I recalled this story a few days ago, when Mexico's newly elected President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were the familiar issues of the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs, and trade.
President Peña Nieto has been eager to talk about the upturn in the Mexican economy, so that Mexicans can now, with equal success, stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants a partnership agreement with the US and Canada and a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nieto has promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals have been made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and old-fashioned issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders at gunpoint to relinquish half of their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events everywhere.
So when a US statesman says nothing critical of Mexico, there are complaints in the press and among the elite of Mexican society that the Americans are encroaching on the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And Montezuma's descendants are belligerent.
Mexico's relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the US is the most complex.
Want to talk about grievances?
There are enough of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in the country, and those who do not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, there are so many people of Mexican origin for one reason only: at one point in their family history, someone - a father or grandfather - was unable to fulfill himself in Mexico and had to head north.
More often than not, they were Mexicans of a certain type - dark-skinned, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
Mexico sees it differently.
Today, our lives are the fulfillment of the American dream, we went to good schools and got good jobs, but we must not forget that even that dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider our own.
United States of America.
Moreover, we know that most of Mexico's elite and ruling class do not like us.
We respond in kind.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as unreal Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is explained by failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We would not be behind the silk curtain now, having found a full life in the US, but having lost spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the US as a child, and it reminds me that there is some friction between real Mexicans and Mexican-Americans - Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Mexican-Americans resent it.
She is a US citizen and believes she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many Mexican-Americans I know do not feel they belong to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
When you get the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
And in the US, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I learned during my trip, as if our relationship is not already complicated enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to re-establish relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to serve as ambassadors of sorts for Mexico and to represent its interests in the US.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could persuade political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing will come of it.
Too many wrongs in the past.
And, given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption, and drug trafficking, many of us don't think the country is that great at all.
Sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And rightly so.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what it did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will also have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still offended by the way their relatives were treated in Mexico more recently.
Yes.
Perhaps we have more in common than I thought.
Old Battles in the New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis possible in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that such hopes are futile.
There is a familiar, meaningless debate about who started it; scores of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time in the conflict, rockets fired from Gaza have landed in the vicinity of Israel's capital, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly bogged down in their perennial conflict, change has arrived in the Middle East.
This may be different, but the events of the Arab Spring have swirled around a host of well-established realities, and Palestinians and Israelis have not been spared the whirlwind that has shaken the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even bloodier than before.
But there are reasons for hope in breaking this mortal impasse.
A War Without Winners
At first glance, the current situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire signed on November 21 holds, this week's clashes have only strengthened the position of security forces on both sides.
Leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in Gaza in 2007, will claim that they forced Israel to retreat, despite their losses.
Despite the destruction of some of the group's leaders and the blockade of 1.7 million residents in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory now controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas's leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new powerful and wealthy friends.
A resurgent regional leader, Turkey, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has come out in support of Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Celebrating Hamas supporters claim to have created an Islamist crescent around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant group Hezbollah rules, to Syria, where increasingly Islamist rebels are on the verge of toppling Bashar al-Assad, and further to Jordan, where Hamas's allies threaten the king's rule.
The most significant shift in the region's balance of power has occurred on Israel's southern borders, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood has grown under President Mohamed Morsi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator with little regard for Hamas support.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, is an organization much like Hamas, and its leaders are more populist.
In future diplomacy, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice cannot be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, hardliners in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
Militarily, Hamas was defeated.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system justified the cost and successfully destroyed many of Hamas's rockets.
Israelis can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the US has stuck to its unchanged position; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest round of violence.
Another important factor is Israel's economic prosperity, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu's government, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Although some 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from Gaza since 2004, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part because of the wall, which enters the West Bank - a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite being illegal under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in the run-up to the January 22 election - has teamed up with even more aggressive conservatives under Avigdor Lieberman, is well positioned.
What is the point of pandering to the Palestinians and giving them a state of their own?
If they were to be given full authority in the West Bank, would they not launch rockets from there toward Israel, as their brethren in Gaza do?
Better to keep them behind a wall and stifle any attempt to raise their heads.
It is possible that the hardliners will prevail; but their calculations may be challenged by the Arab Spring.
While the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have the warmest feelings toward Israel, their priority will be domestic issues.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of all of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egypt's president, Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on the cease-fire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel, no less, must consider the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic change takes hold in Arab countries, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is a ticking time bomb that will sooner or later explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas are paying the price for the international community's growing discontent.
Both sides need external impetus
There remains the only solution that sensible people on both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper, have relentlessly called for: the establishment of two states and the cession of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
The hope, not too impressive in the short term, is that a cease-fire will enable other countries to exert more effective influence over the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which has long since decided to cut off the flow of weapons into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, are in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to recognize the 1967 borders of the Jewish state, with land swaps and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah.
That would do more to create a Palestinian state than an upcoming UN vote that could result in recognition of virtual statehood for Palestine.
President Obama has a role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he remains reluctant to get involved.
This is a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, standardized cigarette packaging legislation has come into force.
Smoking warnings and images of diseased body parts stand out in stark contrast on dull green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
Australia's world-first plain packaging law for cigarettes and tobacco products has come into force, replacing the logos and colours of different brands with the same box of dull olive green with eerie images of diseased body parts and images of children whose health has been damaged by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the various images and signs warning of the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packs, which are mandatory from Saturday, are the names of the stamps, which are printed in the same small font.
These are the world's harshest conditions for packaging tobacco products.
Australia's federal government says the measure is aimed at discouraging young people from smoking by stripping the habit of its fashionable status.
The decision was based on research showing that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26 never become smokers in 99 out of 100 cases.
"It is clear that even at a very young age, children understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to convey through packaging," said Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that have shown, for example, that a crown in a logo is associated with the idea of a princess in children.
Australia has one of the world's lowest smoking rates, so the changes will have little impact on multinational profits, but other countries are already considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has strenuously opposed the legislation.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and accessible cigarettes are sold.
"This legislation will have serious consequences that are different from those intended by its proponents," said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will supply many more of these goods for sale on Australia's streets.
For some, by contrast, the new laws help businesses grow.
Sandra Ha of the small family-owned company Zico Import Pty Ltd says demand for cigars and silicone cases that conceal unpleasant images on packaging has soared (almost from scratch) since companies such as British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris, and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in Australia's high court two months ago.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about 6,000 products to wholesalers and is waiting for a new batch.
It's good business for us.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures, according to experts, is the popularity of social media among the very segment of the population targeted by the measures.
After a series of laws in Australia outlawed television advertising of cigarettes and their support for sporting events, and prohibited cigarette sellers from displaying cigarettes in public, tobacco advertising has moved online.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from advertising online, but it cannot restrict overseas sites.
"If you are a tobacco trader and you have only this small loophole left, the idea of promoting your product online may seem very tempting," explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has seen an increase in the number of reviews of brands written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users on social media sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is this really the work of an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he spared no effort and time and made a video, or is there an advertising company behind it?
British American Tobacco's Australian arm says the industry is now more concerned with adapting to the new rules than advertising.
The tobacco industry has even gone as far as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states are making claims in the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfairly restricted, even though all of these countries have very little trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
Tanya Plibersek said the government had been discussing with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to make it mandatory to post photos warning of the dangers of smoking.
The rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Plenty of smokers in Australia are defiantly disobeying the changes.
These pictures don't bother me.
I just don't pay attention.
"You just grab a cigarette and put it in your pocket," explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a photograph of a mouth tumour on the pack.
Frankly, the only thing that might make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yoo, who runs the King of the Pack tobacco shop in central Sydney, says uniform packaging has made it harder to place products on shelves
"It used to take me an hour to unload a new batch; now it takes me four hours," he complains.
"The government should have taken and banned cigarettes completely, we would have said," OK, it's over, we're closing the shop, "" he says, throwing his hands up.
It's not all bad to be bored in a world of electronic networks and constant connections.
This Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had a mechanical problem and was replaced by another plane that we were waiting for.
So I had plenty of time to reflect on the nature of boredom.
I will not deceive you.
A half-day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and there are no books, no magazines, no iPhones, not even duty-free shops.
Recently, however, a growing number of scholars and child development specialists have spoken out in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations it is not so bad for us and our children to be bored.
This causes the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may encourage creativity.
And because we are all constantly in front of a screen in the modern world, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Perhaps we should aim for boredom?
Yes.
And yet no.
We'll come back to that.
I used to think, like many people, that boredom was an invention of relatively recent times, when people had more free time.
This is not the case, argues Peter Tui, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"Boredom actually has a very ancient history," he says.
Latin inscriptions about boredom dating back to the first century are found on the walls of Pompeii.
That leaves open the question of how we understand boredom.
The problem, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, is that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying research on the topic and asking a task force of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want but cannot do things that would satisfy them."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that the bored person doesn't do what he wants to do.
With apathy, you don't want to do anything.
The key to boredom, he says, is "attention disturbance and the associated mood deterioration and feeling that time is running out slowly."
Boredom can be described as very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood argues that while there may be a link between these conditions, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and circumstances around them, and depressed people see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel bored when it's really hard to focus on something.
In their study, "The Unoccupied Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a recording of a voice reading the journal.
Some of the participants also heard loud noises from an unrelated television program in the next room, others heard the same noises at a low level so that they could barely be discerned, and a third group listened only to a voice recording without an external soundtrack.
Those participants who heard low-level TV reported that they were bored, more often than not - they had difficulty concentrating, but they did not know the reason for it and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or fascinating task, interrupting attention can cause boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, looking at the flow of products on a conveyor belt in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It is believed, he continues, that when people begin to swing on a chair or draw scribbles on a piece of paper, they do so out of boredom, but we now know that actually doing so simply helps not to relax physically.
"Research has shown that children who are not prohibited from twisting and twisting learn better and memorize more information than children who are required to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we all get bored: when a flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting movie.
Different people, however, show different degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a "Boredom Scale" to measure these individual traits.
Questions and statements such as "Much of what I have to do is monotonous and monotonous" or "I have too much interest, so I don't have time for anything" are used to determine the score on this scale.
Using such questionnaires, researchers found that boys are bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are a variety of external stimuli.
In general, however, teenagers are often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he used a pager to communicate with nearly 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
It found that 32% of teenagers said they were bored at school and while doing their homework, and 23% said they were bored outside school.
Meanwhile, only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what similar data on boredom would be like now, 21 years later.
But he knows that "adolescence is the peak of boredom," largely because children and teenagers are not allowed to decide what they want to do.
To return to my original question: Is boredom good?
Sometimes not, because, in extreme cases, studies show, it can encourage people to engage in absurd and dangerous physical activities, gamble or abuse certain substances in an effort to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
"That's how our brains tell us to do something else; that's boredom," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But this same brain does not always know what is best to do.
If you get bored and channel that energy into playing guitar or cooking, you'll make yourself better.
However, if you watch TV, you will only be better off for a while, and soon it will be over.
So if your child is bored and you give them an iPad, they won't be bored, but they won't learn to fight boredom on their own or otherwise manage their time and activity, says Professor Fenske.
"And such self-regulation skills are used in a variety of situations," he argues.
Your child is not only learning to do something on his own; he is also learning to control himself in general.
I don't think boredom should be celebrated.
But it should not be regarded as a bad thing, either.
Rather, one must learn to feel comfortable even outside the constant flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see it in a way that we need to experience boredom more often, and boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from the constant worries and just relax.
"In today's world, we are used to constantly over-stimulating our senses," he says, "and when silence comes, we get lost and don't know what to do."
It's unclear how Colorado's new marijuana legalization law will be implemented
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old football player and community college student in southeast Colorado, is charged with a criminal offense that will soon be perfectly legal statewide: possession of a small portion of marijuana and the pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and friends were driving in Lamar on the prairie near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for drug possession and possession of a drug paraphernalia - minor offenses that each carry a $100 fine - and a court date was set.
"We are treated like criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has persisted in the weeks since Colorado voted to legalize small amounts of recreational marijuana, the resolution of hundreds of minor cases depends less on the law than on the location of the case.
Charges of minor marijuana offenses have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which has adopted a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped charging people 21 and older for low-dose possession, which will become legal as soon as the law takes effect in a couple of weeks.
In more conservative Colorado counties, however, prosecutors have decided to pursue existing marijuana cases and continue to prosecute possession of the drug.
At the same time, some cities from the Denver suburbs to the mountains of the West are voting to keep new, state-licensed marijuana shops out of their neighborhoods.
"It's all moving so fast that I don't even know what to expect next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington state are scratching their heads, too.
They will have to establish rules for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution, and sale of marijuana, all of which must be done by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most other states in regulating marijuana use, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so they will set a good example," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcoholic Beverage Regulatory Board.
But now no one can do more, Mr Smith admits, than put forward some proposals and hope it works.
"We don't have a real precedent to follow," he says.
The Washington state bill, called I-502, will take effect on December 6 and leave the state in limbo for a year, when the state's licensing system does not yet exist and possession of marijuana has already been legalized.
And there are still difficult technical issues to be resolved during this period, such as how to balance the state's order of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on selling it within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, playgrounds, and day care centers.
"It will be particularly difficult to locate licensed marijuana businesses within cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly created Center for Marijuana Legalization research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates of Police in Aurora sent an e-mail to his subordinates informing them that the city attorney's office would no longer prosecute anyone over the age of 21 for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that police would stop prosecuting people for such violations "from now on."
Chief Oates said police would enforce city rules governing medical marijuana growers and would pursue illegal drug dealers and distributors.
The prosecutor for Weld County in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, is taking a more rigorous approach to the issue.
After the vote on the bill, he said prosecutors would continue to prosecute marijuana possession, primarily to encourage users to seek treatment.
So far, 119 people have been charged with possession of two ounces or less of marijuana, though many face other charges.
"It is our agency's responsibility to prosecute actions that are deemed criminal at the time they are committed," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
Reaction has been mixed even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer prosecute adults for possession of small amounts of the drug.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop charges in the already pending marijuana possession cases.
"I believe that it is our direct responsibility to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, incorporating recreational marijuana into the state and legal system will not be easy.
And conflicting reactions from residents across the state have exposed the ambivalence of local authorities about the state's marijuana experiment.
"There is a cultural barrier for district attorneys on this issue," said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents those convicted of marijuana possession and a local spokesman for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
"They've persecuted people for so long for this that they can't really accept that it's not a crime anymore," he said.
Colorado and Washington - the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana in the same way as alcohol - are destined to be pilot states to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Legalization advocates and state officials plan to expand legalized commerce, but they are wary of guidance from federal authorities, who still plan to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Supporters of marijuana legalization hope that the Justice Department will back down on the issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of medical marijuana dealers and patients, the federal government has mostly authorized medical marijuana sales in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Drug Enforcement Agency agents are unlikely to break into homes to seize a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores that are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for federal authorities to act.
Even before the presidential election, some local governments approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana shops, which would not have opened until less than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, introduced a six-month ban on marijuana sales, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in a position where we license someone and then it causes serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a City Council member.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was expelled from Oxford for being a Conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I have always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the world's best educational institution, the modern equivalent of an ancient symposium, laying the two foundations of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying history at Worcester College, Oxford University, in the late eighties, I packed my bags and left, in what turned out to be the first real scandal of my life.
My father couldn't stand it and wept.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed I had dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from chipped cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was systematically harassed and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I went to a private school.
I was bullied for one reason only, and in this celebrated cradle of enlightenment it seemed barbarism and blind bigotry: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a Conservative supporter myself.
So, you ask, why think about it now?
According to recent data, a new generation of center-right students is being subjected to the same kind of harassment.
Such is the institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of Conservative students at Oxford that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as those afforded to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and made to feel unwelcome" because of their political views.
They want to add a representative to the college's equal rights committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only made worse by a recent BBC 2 documentary on student politics, Wonderland: Young, Smart, and Right, which portrayed the Conservatives as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film showed Joe Cooke, the former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, riding in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a silver-plated walking stick.
At other universities, Conservative students complain that they are being made "scapegoats for higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing bias within the university community.
People who don't even know us consider us to be the arrogant and violent children of wealthy parents. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi College, where the petition for greater protection was filed, calls the atmosphere "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cherill, 19, the new president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, says the attitude of members of the student club towards those with centre-right views has deteriorated significantly.
"This is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate and the normal life of club members," she said.
In my first few weeks at Oxford, I was not just in the minority; I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a shy and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford was awash with hatred of the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university had voted to strip former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree because of budget cuts to higher education.
Even Stalinists would be uncomfortable in such an atmosphere.
In the early days of Freshers week, when students get to know each other and the faculty, I felt for the first time what lay ahead.
What I didn't know was that not only did teachers condone the bullying of Conservative students, but they were also happy to take part in it themselves.
Political issues - the miners "strike, privatization, and the government's opposition to sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - permeated the wood-paneled walls of the classrooms.
At my first seminar, I had to translate an eighteenth-century French text into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was difficult for me to get through, I got stuck in.
Harry Pitt was a very bile man with a cake-like face.
"Are Thatcherites fundamentally not learning French, or are they just brainless?" he asked.
Other students giggled.
Tears came out of my eyes.
"I advise you to take some early French lessons in your spare time, unless you're very busy spinning around in the company," quipped Pitt.
I went back to my room utterly miserable.
That evening in college, I was sitting alone at lunch; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year English student who introduced himself as a member of the University Conservative Association.
"I know who you are," he said amiably.
- Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
Anyone suspected of sympathising with the Conservatives will be mocked.
It's not easy for me, and in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be harder for you.
Most Conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour. "
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to be hypocritical.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, politics and economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "You're the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious. '
Other students echoed his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" one asked.
"They beat each other up, don't they?"
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the decriminalisation of the sixties.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford?
Or will I have to meet like-minded people only in the middle of the night?
Will I be forced to become a Labour woman and hide my true beliefs?
The three years ahead of me began to seem like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only lecturer at my college who made no secret of his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a Conservative, but also for being Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He barely showed up in college.
He despised it for its provincialism, pettiness, and adherence to a Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents "home in London, seeking refuge among relatives and unbiased metropolitan friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the Forties, all political views were accepted there.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said.
- They are not capable of such a thing, but not in a city of dormant spires...
Even my communist friends have always behaved impeccably. "
His wet eyes blurred.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You will break my heart if you drop out of university. "
I was exhausted by the constant trips to London and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also a Conservative, could not bear the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
The following week, at a seminar, when another history teacher called me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Burning with shame, I confessed that "my parents brainwashed me" and called them "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
The final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was my father's.
At the time, he was writing two columns a week for Rupert Murdoch-owned newspapers.
My door was locked.
I didn't leave, and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and boarded the first train to London.
I never came back.
Call me a weeping rag.
But at the age of eighteen, no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation in an educational institution.
It is all the more sad that this was Oxford, which not only produced fourteen Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind the undeserved reputation of a university that values equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
ABC talks to Nati Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other well-known clients of the Italian designer about the Valentino: Master of Sewing exhibition, which opened this week in London
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of "Valentino: Master of Sewing," a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 haute couture gowns created by his "house" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says in his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "il signore" Garavani, but it could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobility.
The first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, is replete with personal letters and photographs signed by the most distinguished aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social ascent, from the humble tailor from Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international "elite."
There is nothing wrong with being in love with the royal court.
"They don't even put out cigarette butts on your gorgeous carpet, like some great pop stars do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an excellent host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved coming to his chalet in Gstaad," explains "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
Yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza recalls the charismatic fashion designer.
One day, we went to dinner at his house, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy Jr.
Valentino's style manifested itself in every detail of his apartment, in its decoration, in its food, in its music.
"Each of the guests was made to feel important and loved by Valentino," recalls the "top model," whose work with the designer began in 1995 during Paris Haute Couture Week.
"He never goes out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art," she concludes.
Pedigree parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsession, but of fully reciprocated love.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk of sixty metres in length that offers a change of roles: a visitor takes the place of a model and has to defile down the catwalk, contemplating the "audience" of dreams that gleam with Valentino masterpieces, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the suit used by Monica Vitti in "The Nights," or the wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Fara Diba.
Names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophia Habsburg shine in this crowd of models.
Naty Abascal and fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember him well.
They were trousers, a shirt, a "vest" and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to the rest of us for his femininity, for his great love of women, because he emphasises our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and "fit" his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion legislator Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she dressed in Valentino, either.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed that I would have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
At last that hour came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear to a party at my cousin Prince Edward de Lin's castle.
It was a red dress, with a fringed skirt, a pleated corsage and a strapless neckline.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her holiday dresses from the designer with "the utmost care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories that accompany it."
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory-coloured silk dress with pearl inlay, twelve different types of lace, and a train four and a half metres long.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority in the specialized press, the dress represents a milestone in late twentieth-century high fashion, "the return of female clients from the highest world."
Fooled for years by the elite's "lifestyle," Valentino is now its best representative.
A Grand Cross (the highest distinction in Italy), a Chevalier of Labor, and a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, awarded the Legion of Honor, Garavani has collected as many honors as any of his clients "spouses.
"I was always attracted to his refinement, his composure, his neat and immaculate appearance," D'Arenberg recalls.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at a table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time doesn't exist for him."
If that's what a princess says...
The World's Hardest Occupation: Miners from Kawah-Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and limb by dragging 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of the volcano along steep rocky paths
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others who literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who make a living extracting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where sulphur gas rising from the depths of the earth solidifies on contact with the air.
After breaking off huge pieces of sulphur, which can weigh up to 70 kg, he places them in two bamboo baskets, weighs them on his shoulders, and carries them up a steep, rocky road.
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres, but the exhausted loaders take more than 40 minutes to climb in tortoise-like steps, struggling to maintain their balance and carefully probing the road to avoid slipping and falling over the precipice.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the Kawah Ijen cliffs a few years ago.
Miners from Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur they produce
Once at the top, they make their way between tourists, who photograph them as if they were monkeys from a circus, and, wearily carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales that the mining company has placed just above, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano and, better yet, its workers since 1960, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemical industries, because the mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"Since it is the norm to carry 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each walk," Anto, who usually carries three daily, explains to us.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
While that seems a minuscule amount for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn on the field.
"Miners' daily wages are very high by local standards, where coffee harvesting is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the porter, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not that heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a compelling reason that is as devastating as sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Hindu-dominated Bali and brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and has tears in his eyes because of toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking his life in Kawah-Ijen, whose sulphur had already begun to affect him despite wearing a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and has tears in his eyes because of the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
That is the price he must pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work another two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could have been a tour guide, waiter, or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the sulphur does not stop leaking at night when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and glows in the gloom.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, lighting up the road with a small torch attached to his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carry sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work on their own account and with such hardship.
In fact, they do not receive even a fraction of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) photography fee that, along with the 15,000 rupee (1.2 euros) admission fee, the conservancy charges tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"It's a job for cattle, not people," says Badrucin, a stocky porter for 42 years who has spent three decades on Kawah Ijen since leaving college.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilograms, he says he will tolerate work "as long as he can," because he needs money to educate his three children, aged 18 to 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life
Although sulphur burns the throat and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so resilient that no one complains about their severe illnesses... more serious obviously than their habitual breathing problems, arthrosis, knee pain and shoulder sores, which have deformed under the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can now only lift 50 kilograms at 53 years of age.
Every day, he and his comrades carry 15 tons of sulphur out of the volcano, which three trucks transport to a warehouse in Tamansari, covering a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the thickets.
"I won't retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, his mouth wide open, missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest jobs in the world: what human mules from the Kawah Ijen do.
Singapore seeks children to save its economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress, and housing and education costs for not having children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I am a patriot husband, you are my patriot wife, let's fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem unlikely that these lines are part of an advert for mint tortillas, but despite this - or perhaps because of it - the video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local proverbs like "Let's put the bao (bun) in the oven" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising agency that made the video, BBH, cherishes the hope that it will be able to draw attention to the problem in an entertaining way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do "their national duty."
It's an Internet-only thing, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in terms of reproducing ourselves, so we felt that this was a topic that we needed to address.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things, like launching perfumes with pheromones or organising fast-dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely compose a rap?
1.2 children
Who does not take this so lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and provides tax credits.
But all of this has little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and strict social control.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population office, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why aren't Singaporeans having more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Couple and Family Policy Division of the National Population Directorate, says the reason is "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"This has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities beyond getting married and starting a family," she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and the postponement of marriage and childbirth, which has reduced Singapore's birth rate.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that aims to dramatically increase immigration to counter population decline is causing resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites where barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and refusing to integrate, thrives.
Rising immigration is also seen as one reason why Singapore's ruling party scored its worst election result since independence last year.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem, with quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling birth rates have a known impact on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health-care spending, and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making an effort not to build so many small dwellings.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Guide has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes," that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments with an area of 46 square meters sell very well.
However, it is argued that they can encourage idle lifestyles and discourage developers who want to build large family homes.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of home builder EL Developers, says their "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments sell for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash inflows are increasing.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers who have previously been put off if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step toward boosting the national birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the center, it seems that they will have little effect.
"People are very stressed, housing is expensive, so is education, and that's why a lot of people are putting it off," says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another 20-year-old.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and housing and education costs as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, however much the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, when it comes to childbearing, Singaporeans have the last word.
Personal offline - Personal online
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, this is a private property or "a sphere of privacy that they have the right to protect against any interference."
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when discussing situations online that he probably would not share offline?
elPeriódico interviewed five children aged ten to 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine," on a personal level, and "password and username" when they applied it to social media.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't upload to a post," says ten-year-old Jorge as he tries to explain the meaning of personal on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mum may know them, but not the whole world," he says.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I also have fun with my friends.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who behaves stupidly," he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to post obscene nude photos of people, crimes, or write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has at FB and the nine followers he has on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother is aware, she has the password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just upload them," he adds.
"Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends quickly," he says.
Without hesitation, he replies that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't consider someone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter he admits not knowing the 20 people added to his friend list.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one trusted him or asked for his home address or telephone number.
"If I'm pressured or demanded, I'll just delete it from my account," he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of my friend's was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
"Just turned privacy on."
He then explains the sequence of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do it if I didn't like the person or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cyberbullying," he confirms.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and education and training specialist, believes that to guide children and teenagers, you need to understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a tool for searching for information, but the rules of the game have changed with the advent of these sites," she says.
Porras points out that the academic Mark Prensky, a master of pedagogy at Yale University and author of Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are the children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are still learning," she says.
He explains that the topic is complex "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published, or said, at an age when maturity is lacking."
"They also need to be selective when it's most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what privacy is to children and teenagers is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it is useless," she adds.
Porras then lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it online?
Or, would you like it if you posted a photo of you like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you sign party photos, do you ask other people for permission to mark them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they must behave online as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"Off the Internet, people behave with respect, responsibility and other principles, just like they should on social media," she said.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university lecturer, primary education professor and education consultant, explains the need for heads of households to read social media policies faithfully.
By understanding each point, they are well placed to talk to children about the prerequisites of opening an online account.
"For example, the age and what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
According to Gaudia, the key is to remind children the lesson "don't talk to strangers."
UNASUR summit ends without the Lima Declaration being made public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the announcement of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven binding members.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Assembly of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources in the Office of the President and the Office of the President indicated on the front page that it would be handed over after the closure, but then confirmed that at some point it would be published on the Peruvian government's website.
In response to questions about the text, they pointed out that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only a video of the presidential assembly was broadcast, in the press room, without a sound, with the message "closed session, no sound."
Little of the information that circulated to reporters was conveyed by the spokesmen of some UNASUR governments that were present at the meeting, but not to the Peruvian one.
The only document circulated throughout the day was a list of participating presidents, which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian presidential administration sent an e-mail to the media with the summit's "final declaration," but this was Humala's statement, not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and this time, despite repeated press demands, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was also not circulated.
The ASPA's official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that transmission systems were in place for all journalists, but limited the flow of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to accept the verdict of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which on Monday in The Hague will begin hearing the arguments of both parties in Lima's indictment against Santiago.
"We will respect and implement a judgment that clarifies the differences that we are currently submitting to this international court," Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of differences, pacts, and international tribunals," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake amid the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would submit to the International Court of Justice comes on the heels of Colombia's challenge this week to the Bogotá Pact, under which it accepted obedience to the Court's verdicts following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it deemed erroneous.
The summit took place in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former president, Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit just after noon Lima time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and the course of action for 31 projects among South American countries had been approved, with an estimated investment of $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries would take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding residency agreements."
He reported that actions are being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and organized transnational crime, actions to increase the availability of medicines, low-cost Internet access in all parts of South America, and to address the risks of natural disasters in a comprehensive and effective manner."
With Europe in crisis, "the economic unification (of Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our productive base and foresee a better future for our cities," Humala added.
"We have decided to grant privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of parts of South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and creating new economic schemes," the Peruvian president said in a statement read out.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five are in Peru and are limited to transverse axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide further details.
The final document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, united, and with good relations between neighbors was another theme highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos, said before attending the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate respectfully on the maritime dispute resulting from the verdict of the international court challenged by Bogota.
"The day after tomorrow (Saturday), maybe I will meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will reconsider all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto.
Also on the margins of the summit, the bloc's defense ministers met provisionally to approve the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the issue of protecting the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay make up UNASUR, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru holds the interim presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America should learn from Europe in integrating citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe."
Correa, who attended the Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, told Peruvian state television that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and other clashes, "but now they are practically one homeland."
In this context, he defended the South American citizenship project, which the UNASUR member countries endorse.
"We need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to take us back to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President has also shown himself to be in favour of reviving the Organization of American States (OAS) on the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who lecture never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States," he said, alluding to Ecuador's political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret the decision, because with it he did not betray his principles, but respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that at the time "there was some suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be respected."
He also criticized the Swedish justice system for requiring him to come to its territory for questioning about an alleged sexual crime, when "Swedish law itself considers it possible to do so by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa confirmed that there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I have not spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
What is really there is the danger of his physical and mental health deteriorating by being confined in a small space without being able to exercise in the air.
"It affects everyone's health," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by providing an immunity guarantee that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities, and stressed that there were talks in London to find a solution to the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use that word here, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garzón, is conducting a number of proceedings in different European instances," he said.
And he suggested that "if the UK provides a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it will be over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly permits, and as it has done on other occasions, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype, the problem will be solved tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to assert himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that he does not tolerate "mediocrity, bad faith, and lies that distort freedom of expression."
"The main enemies of press freedom are not corrupt rogue politicians, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this respect, he was pleased that neither these journalists nor "the bankers nor the bourgeois hegemonic countries dominate Ecuador," and added that, if re-elected, he would "deepen the revolution in order to continue development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups disguised as legality," because in reality "this has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian President also deemed "absolutely justified" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
To date, this decision has not been respected.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflict is inevitable, but it must be overcome by a desire to walk together.
We need to process them together to overcome them and move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court, and suggested that "it is right for Latin America to have recourse to international bodies if the two countries commit themselves to a decision, no matter how difficult it may be."
Regarding the possibility of standing as a candidate in Ecuador's upcoming presidential election to seek a third consecutive term, he said he viewed the possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult."
Correa has said that if he loses the elections in February 2013, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can be corrected only by political power.
"My political movement thought I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to accept that responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, and then we walk out of public life.
If we lose, the same.
"It's a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's new treatment in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had gone for treatment that was already planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean that President Chávez's health is deteriorating," he explained.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima in the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
Deaths from AIDS today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was announced that his test for AIDS had tested positive.
"I was kind of dumbfounded," he recalls that difficult, despite the doctor's tact, moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
Determined to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn more about it. And his efforts paid off - he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he arrived in 1994 after overcoming many obstacles.
He has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 1990s, this would have been hard to believe - there were too few treatment options, too little knowledge of the disease, too much prejudice.
Thus, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Social Security Institute did not want to say goodbye to him "because he had a cut."
In other words, in those days, having AIDS was a sentence.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so without compromising the quality of life.
Yet, unaware of their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already damaged, "depleted" their immune systems and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "the great achievement so far is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and that of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific journal.
Infection specialist and HIV / AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but that life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients have at the onset of diagnosis, with a better life expectancy for non-drug users: up to 30 years with 200 CD4, and up to 50 years with 500 CD4 reported.
Simply put, this means that someone who is diagnosed as HIV positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "can live without problems until the age of 75," he explained.
To assess this progress, it is worth remembering that Mexicans today have a life expectancy of 76 years on average.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths had already been recorded by May of this year; however, it is claimed that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still fatalities?
- Personally, it seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how things are in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years we have had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients arrive very late because they are unaware of their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He cited devastating data: "Nine out of ten patients come in when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, so samples should be made available for detection on a mass scale, for all people who request it."
Experts and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA) agree on this proposal, as do patients like Fabrizio, who went to a private laboratory for testing, motivated only by the fact that his friend had done so and, despite his young age, he was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is a common complication.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die anyway, I'd rather hang out three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, exercise, take medication.
Today, his parents only know he has cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I take care of myself and the other person in a responsible way," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to motivate those who now, in the context of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let them be tested if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person while being responsible.
This is his message summarizing the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
The gulf between health-care programs and ordinary citizens is wide, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist in Guadalajara who focuses on HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, we used to be given one or two, now we are given packets of a hundred, which is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to a condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you want them?" is a popular question that teenagers don't want to hear, with scorn and condemnation from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy workers and health workers, the propagandist said.
I propose that this inefficient distribution be changed; that condoms not only be behind the counter, but that a hundred of them be placed in vending machines in public toilets in places frequented by young people.
This is not encouraging promiscuity.
It's not about paying for beer and a motel, Governor Emilio Gonzalez said when asked if condoms could be distributed under his leadership.
"It's not about sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already sexually active," he said.
Key data in Jalisco
A total of 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) have been reported.
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections are through sex, 6% through blood, and 2% through the perinatal route.
An estimated 50,000 people may be living with HIV, as for every reported case, there are between four and five people who are unaware of it.
Given the ratification by a United States appeals court of a decision that annuls the debt restructuring of the Vitro Group achieved through insolvency proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a fatal precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in a neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures to support the survival of firms, which are permitted by Mexican law, are not valid in the land of stripes and stars, in contravention of international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of the June 15 ruling by Judge Harlin Hale in the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of seizure of their assets across the Rio Grande.
But the ruling opens the door for Mexico's leading glass producer to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies.
By way of introduction, while the case judge notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says that the main proceeding concerns insolvency proceedings pending in Mexico.
The first implies the abrogation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, the UN Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, designating the American Law Institute as the arbitrator.
Second, the verdict establishes that without the inter-company vote, the debts recognized in the critical mass of insolvency proceedings owed to Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company would not have reached the majority needed to approve the restructuring.
Nevertheless, Mexican law recognizes this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme has been adopted.
There are a half-dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose inter-firm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
It is also true that, subtracting the votes of affiliates, Vitro's creditors who fought against it in United States courts, namely vulture funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International, and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37 percent.
The Court of Appeal omits these data.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, affected by the severe economic crisis that hit the United States, hitting the country.
For now, the González Sada family's firm will appeal the decision to the appeals court itself, so that the vote goes to its plenum - that is, to the five judges, because only three voted.
If that fails, a certification application will be filed, which will require a review of the process by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government in its capacity as amicus curiae ("friend of the court"), which describes the process that Vitro follows under the Insolvency Act, signaling that it is absolving itself of complying with the agreements signed by both countries in order to bind it to Article 15 of the US Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has obeyed the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for cases of inter-state insolvency, which guarantee equal treatment of debtors and creditors.
Carambol from two sides: they beat Vitro and beat the country.
Overall Balance Sheet
With complaints put on the table for months by Mexicana de Aviación unions against the company's former owner, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Airline Pilots "Union Association has already discovered a bottle neck.
The court headed by Carlos Diaz Chávez Morino has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic on a transaction carried out by an entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from trust fund F / 589 of Bank IXE on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The resources would be used to buy shares in the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Ascarraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Surrounding Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen, and members of general civil society endorsed the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of China's Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a giant sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for the employees of 150 companies.
Earlier, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to confront the monumental forces that have razed part of the protected areas to the ground and pose serious threats against the industry.
The Death of ACTA
Regarding the Senate's rejection of the Government's demand to explain under what conditions and circumstances Mexico's ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already been archived.
As you know, the action was taken despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of viewing it as a violation of freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the Long Term
In an effort to repay long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, homex, the housing developer, is placing 500 million pesos worth of exchange certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical, with an offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competitive is born
Formed by NYCE, e-Quality, and Kernet, leaders in information technology, the consortium with the brand name Competitive has just been born, and its goal will be to market the services of software clusters in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed 1.5 billion dollars.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
An avid basketball traveler, Hector "Hetin" Reyes was associated with the sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to it, traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many basketball stories as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years before a brain haemorrhage forced him to use a wheelchair in 2008, as a minor league player, Major League Basketball player, BSN representative and manager with the Bayamón Cowboys, and president of the Basketball Federation.
"I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and president of the federation in the 1990s," recalled Reyes during Primera Hora's visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected during his long journey, bear witness to this.
Bayamon in the Heart
His greatest emotions are those that remember his journey through the Cowboys, from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 as a co-agent or contract agent.
"Those were my best years, which I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz took over, and he was a great administrator, "Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who came here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I've got a very strong player for you, 6 '7 tall."
"Do you want it?"
And that was the start of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who gained citizenship and became one of our top scorers.
I remember saying that if Mincy had brought Bayamon the championship, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboys "championship with Gauss, but from a distance, because by 1988 I was already listed as head of the federation.
By then, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and it should have been bronze, but for the Canadian referee who forced us to play the final game, Reyes said.
Is that team from the 1990 World Cup the best you've ever seen?
It is among the best, as well as the one that won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and beat a US team that was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
Not only did Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and 'Piculín' (Ortiz) again play in that team, but also the young (Javier) 'Toñito' Colón and James Carter, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quijote' Morales, who was unable to participate in 1990 because of a knee injury.
The team that may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic qualifying tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role players like 'Canito' Nieves, Pablo Alicea, and the young Rolando Hurruitner replacing players suspended for the mess at Mar del Plata Pan American Championship, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculín Ortiz.
His record at international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level in the way Piculín has.
And that doesn't take into account his career in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
This is a very complex issue.
We had a very good colt, including Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the younger ones, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you consider your main achievement in the federation?
Participated in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams per season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I wanted to implement, such as regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, the boys from Ponce play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now, the guys travel and play too much, and it's too much.
At least I can see the fruits of mandatory certification and training for managers, officials, and referees.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos from my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "JR," in the television series "Dallas," in which he portrayed a principled, evil, and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon-predator JR Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the studio behind "Dallas."
"Larry is back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role that he loved most," his family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving market.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her spokesman Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented and I will miss him dearly.
"He was an original person and lived life to the full," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted to drinking for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Long before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on television for his role as a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive genie, played by Barbara Eden, and begins to live with her under the same roof.
He also starred in two comedies that rarely aired, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included roles well received by critics in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the delightfully repulsive J.R. that propelled Hagman to the pinnacle of fame.
CBS's drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its entourage aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot JR?," designed to create hype around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is nearly killed, has generated international debate and millions of dollars in betting odds.
It also helped draw record audiences to the series at the time.
When the answer was given in an episode in November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers watched it, making "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in history, after the 1983 finale of "MASH," which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was JR's sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
JR stopped her and then threatened her that he would accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest businessman and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be admitted for treatment.
"I know what should be on JR's tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be said: "Here lies honest citizen JR Ewing."
It is the only deal he has lost.
Victoria Principal, also a character in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, both on and off screen."
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who are fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on TNT.
Five episodes of the second season have already been completed and a sixth was in production, the channel said.
Warner or TNT have yet to make a statement about what will happen to the series after Hagman's departure.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shone in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theatre scene in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met and married a young Swedish artist, Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, home to many celebrities.
In 2001, he called his memoir "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales About My Life."
"I didn't include anything there that I thought would hurt anyone or affect them in any way," he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After his liver transplant, he began promoting organ donation and volunteered at the hospital to help patients with fear.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go for surgery and after," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some consolation, like "don't be afraid, it will be a bit uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He was also an active anti-smoking campaigner and took part in several campaigns.
Begins a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible lure: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar, December 21, which many people seized on as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a financial crisis that some have called "debt Armageddon," and a growing conflict involving Israel, a place where end-of-the-world Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharma told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you look at what's going on in the world at the moment, as if we have only 30 days left, it's been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he is not the only professor offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Associate Professor Barry Wacker is giving a course on "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way in which hypothetical scenarios that induce certain human behaviors are proposed.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed apocalyptic-themed films and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell students what is possible, probably plausible, and impossible," Wacker said.
At Pennsylvania State University's main campus, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to deliver a course called simply "The End of the World."
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the end of the world doesn't come," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent destruction," students must study, prepare projects, and sit final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the night when the end of the world is supposed to arrive," Restall said.
The courses have proved quite popular.
"Places finished in two hours," Restall said of his course for students with high average scores, which had 35 students enrolling.
We received emails in the weeks leading up to the start of the term from people asking if there were any other places.
Students, in turn, claim that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I love watching what people do to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And an apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or lack of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a course that teaches this," he said.
I like it.
But none of the students interviewed - let alone the professor - said they believed in the end-of-the-world date of December 21.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old final year student at Temple University in West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back several centuries, where people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has fueled this speculation.
"In other places, people don't think about it," he said.
Mainly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, was quick to answer the question of whether he knew of any course about the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he wrote, alluding to a superior order.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that there had long been talk of many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or thinking that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and faculty are careless about this date.
Some said they were going to "end of the world" parties.
"Maybe I'll call a friend to have a laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
